            "With a top quality legal profession comprising both local and international law firms and advocates, the truly independent judiciary and modern legal infrastructure, Hong Kong is well placed to be the regional hub for legal services, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said today (April 8) in the Hague, the Netherlands.",
            "Mr Yuen was delivering a keynote speech at the event \"The Hague Conference at 120: Today and the Future\" held in the Hague today to celebrate the 120th anniversary of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (the Hague Conference). He said that Hong Kong for years has been, and will remain, a truly cosmopolitan and international city, and is internationally well known for its commitment to the rule of law and its truly independent judiciary.",
            "\"As confirmed in our Chief Executive's latest Policy Address, it is our Government's policy to enhance Hong Kong's status as a regional hub for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region.",
            "\"Such policy and attributes of Hong Kong would be of considerable value in assisting the Asia Pacific Regional Office of the Hague Conference, which was set up in Hong Kong in December last year, in the performance of its function and fulfilment of its objective of harmonising private international law,\" he said.",
            "Mr Yuen pointed out that the Hague Conference has become a global forum truly representative of the international community in all important aspects concerning private international law.",
            "The Asia Pacific region is a very vibrant and dynamic region. Jurisdictions within the Asia Pacific region provide strong momentum for regional and global economic growth. On the turn of the millennium, the work of the Hague Conference was visibly extended to cover jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region on top of those in Latin America and other parts of the world.",
            "The establishment of the Asia Pacific Regional Office in Hong Kong is a logical and desirable development in the history of the Hague Conference, he added.",
            "Noting that there exist vast diversities amongst the jurisdictions within the Asia Pacific region, Mr Yuen said that the Hague Conventions, which are intended to bridge different cultures and legal traditions, are accordingly very useful in providing a common framework for legal co-operation both for the states in the region and between those states within and those outside the region.",
            "Since its official opening in December last year, the Regional Office has started its outreach by establishing a network with different institutions in the region, and organising a series of workshops, seminars and meetings.",
            "\"As the processes of globalisation, regional integration and technological advances continue, states are becoming more and more interdependent and the need to have a co-ordinated or harmonised framework of private international law becomes even more important,\" Mr Yuen said.",
            "Upon his arrival in the Hague yesterday (April 7), Mr Yuen met a group of Hong Kong students studying in the Netherlands, and briefed them on Hong Kong's latest developments.",
            "Apart from attending today's celebration event, Mr Yuen also met with the Secretary General of the Hague Conference, Mr Hans van Loon, and visited the Permanent Court of Arbitration.",
            "Before returning to Hong Kong tomorrow (April 9), Mr Yuen will call on the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Mr Chen Xu.",

            "袁國強今日在海牙出席名為「海牙會議一百二十周年︰今日與未來」的活動，慶祝海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）成立一百二十周年。他在致辭時表示香港多年來一直是真正的國際都會及城市，其維護法治和司法獨立的決心蜚聲國際。",
            "他說︰「行政長官在最近的《施政報告》中確認，提升香港作為亞太區域的爭議解決和法律服務中心的地位是政府的政策。」",
            "「香港的這項政策和特點，對協助於去年十二月在香港成立的海牙會議亞太區域辦事處履行其協調國際私法的功能和目標，有十分重要的價值。」",

            "他補充說，在香港成立的亞太區域辦事處是海牙會議歷史上順理成章及理想的發展。",
            "袁國強表示亞太區域內的司法管轄區有很多不同之處，《海牙公約》旨在連繫不同的文化和法律傳統，對為區域內、外的國家提供共同的法律合作架構產生很大的作用。",
            "區域辦事處自去年十二月正式運作後，已經與區域內不同機構建立聯繫網絡，並舉辦了一系列的工作坊、研討會和會議。",
            "袁國強說︰「隨着全球一體化、區域融合和科技發展持續，各國越來越需要互相倚傍，要成立協調國際私法架構的需求變得更為重要。」",
