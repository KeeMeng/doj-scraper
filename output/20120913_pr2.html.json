            "Following is the translation of the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong Legal Services Forum ‐ \"Hong Kong Legal Services ‐ Think Global, Think Hong Kong\" ‐ organised by the Department of Justice in Guangzhou this morning (September 13):",
            "Distinguished Vice‐Governor Mr Xu, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,",
            "Good morning. Let me welcome all of you to the Hong Kong Legal Services Forum.",
            "Mainland enterprises have a great demand for high‐end legal and commercial dispute resolution services, whether for establishing their operations, for \"going global\" or expanding their business. With a view to establishing mutual interest and benefits, the Department of Justice (DoJ) held the first Hong Kong Legal Services Forum in Shanghai in 2010. This is the second time we have hosted the Forum.",
            "Guangzhou is the economic centre of southern China as well as an important gateway for the opening up of the country. Over half of the cases in Mainland China involving parties from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan were dealt with by courts in Guangdong Province. The DoJ and the co‐organisers (Note 1) have therefore decided to host the Second Forum in Guangzhou to enable the legal and arbitration communities of Hong Kong to share with their Guangdong counterparts their experience and to strengthen co‐operation.",
            "Under the principle of \"One Country, Two Systems\" enshrined in the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) still maintains its common law system which is familiar to the international community. Hong Kong lawyers have all along been providing high‐quality legal services in various areas such as civil and business law. In addition, thanks to our excellent geographical location, advanced telecommunication networks and flourishing business opportunities, many renowned international law firms have chosen to set up branch offices in Hong Kong, offering a wide range of legal services. All these have provided favourable conditions for Hong Kong to develop and enhance the competitiveness of our legal services.",
            "Moreover, the HKSAR Government has spared no efforts in promoting the development of dispute resolution methods other than litigation. The Mediation Ordinance was just enacted in June this year, and we believe that it will help promote a wider and more effective use of mediation in Hong Kong to resolve disputes. The \"Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association Limited\" was incorporated and established last month. This is an industry‐led body which will perform important roles such as accreditation of mediators in Hong Kong and disciplinary functions. The establishment of the Association is a significant milestone in the development of mediation in Hong Kong.",
            "As regards arbitration, the new Arbitration Ordinance which came into effect in June 2011 in Hong Kong is modelled on the UNCITRAL Model Law adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The Ordinance reinforces the advantages of arbitration, including respect for the parties' autonomy as well as the savings in time and cost for them, and at the same time protects confidentiality in arbitration proceedings and related court hearings.",
            "We have also made continuous efforts to internationalise our arbitration services. Apart from the existing Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce opened a branch of its Secretariat in Hong Kong in 2008. Moreover, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission has decided to establish its office in Hong Kong on September 24. This will boost the competitiveness of Hong Kong as the place for international arbitration.",
            "In the past two to three years, good progress has been made in the co‐operation between the legal professions of the Mainland and Hong Kong. The Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) Supplement VIII, signed in December 2011, had put forth new measures to foster closer co‐operation between the legal professions of the Mainland and Hong Kong, and to explore ways of improving the mode of association of law firms of the two places. Under CEPA Supplement IX, signed in June 2012, Hong Kong law firms that have set up representative offices in the Mainland are allowed to operate in association with one to three Mainland law firms. It is believed that the new measures will positively enhance co‐operation between Guangdong and Hong Kong lawyers.",
            "In the Outline of the National 12th Five‐Year Plan, our country has given particular emphasis to the need to deepen Hong Kong‐Guangdong co‐operation and implement the Framework Agreement on Hong Kong/Guangdong Co‐operation. Withthe benefit of the platform provided by the Framework Agreement, we will actively seek to enhance co‐operation with our counterparts in Guangdong and promote the implementation of the pilot measures in Qianhai, Shenzhen, for developing legal and arbitration services. In particular, under appropriate circumstances, enterprises operating in Qianhai shall be allowed to choose Hong Kong laws as the applicable law for their business contracts, and to encourage them to choose arbitration as a means of resolving commercial disputes.",
            "The Forum today will create an excellent opportunity for fostering future co‐operation. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all co‐organisers and supporting organisations which have rendered assistance to the Forum, including the People's Government of Guangdong Province, the Higher People's Court of Guangdong Province, the justice departments and bureaux as well as lawyers associations of various municipalities. Last but not least, I would also like to thank all the guest speakers and each of the participants in the Forum.",
            "On that note, may I wish the Forum a great success with fruitful outcomes. Thank you.",
            "Note 1: The co‐organisers are the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Law Society of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre and the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce.",

            "尊敬的許瑞生副省長、尊敬的各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：",
            "大家好！歡迎各位出席今天的「香港法律服務論壇」。",
            "國內的企業，無論是在成立的過程中也好，還是在「走出去」或發展其業務的過程中也好，對於高端的法律服務和解決商業爭議的服務，需求也十分殷切。在互助互利的前提下，香港律政司在二○一○年首次在上海舉行「香港法律服務論壇」，這次已經是我們第二次舉行這個論壇。",
            "廣州是華南地區的經濟重心，也是國家對外開放的重要門戶。此外，全國超過一半的涉港澳台案件也是由廣東省的法院處理，律政司跟合辦機構（註一）因此決定在廣州舉辦第二屆論壇，讓香港的法律和仲裁業界與廣東省的同行分享經驗，深化合作。",
            "香港在《基本法》「一國兩制」的原則下，繼續採用國際熟悉的普通法制度。香港律師在處理民商事等不同範疇的法律工作，一直也提供優質服務。此外，由於香港優越的地理環境、先進的通訊網絡和蓬勃的商機，不少有名的國際律師行也選擇在香港設立分行，提供不同領域的法律服務。這些都為香港創造了良好條件，發展和提升法律服務的競爭力。",
            "此外，香港特區政府在推動傳統訴訟以外的解決爭議方法的發展，一直也不遺餘力。《調解條例》已經在今年六月通過，相信可以推動香港更廣泛和有效地使用調解處理爭議。「香港調解資歷評審協會」也在上月成立。這個協會由業界主導，將會擔當調解員資格評審和紀律審裁等的重要職能，這是香港發展調解一個重要的里程碑。",
            "在仲裁方面，新的《仲裁條例》在二○一一年六月開始生效，全面引進聯合國國際貿易法委員會的《示範法》，一方面強化仲裁的優點，包括尊重仲裁各方的自主權，以及節省仲裁各方的時間和金錢；同時保障仲裁程序和涉及法院聆訊的保密性。",
            "我們也不斷將仲裁服務國際化，除了原有的香港國際仲裁中心，國際商會的國際仲裁院於二○○八年在香港設立秘書處分處。中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會也已經決定在九月二十四日在香港設立辦事處。這對於香港提升在國際仲裁方面的競爭力有着正面的作用。",
            "過去兩三年，內地和香港法律業界方面的合作，取得了蠻好的發展。二○一一年十二月簽署的《CEPA 補充協議八》提出進一步加強內地與香港律師業的合作，探索完善兩地律師事務所聯營方式的新措施；今年六月簽署的《CEPA 補充協議九》訂明允許已在內地設立代表機構的香港律師事務所與一至三家內地律師事務所實行聯營。新的措施對於推進粵港律師之間的合作，一定會帶來積極的效果。",
            "國家在「十二五規劃綱要」特別強調要深化粵港合作和落實《粵港合作框架協議》。有了《框架協議》提供的平台，我們會積極尋求與廣東省同業加強合作，推動在深圳前海落實「先行先試」的措施，發展法律及仲裁服務，也特別希望推動在前海經營的企業，在適當的情況下可採用香港法律作為商業合同的適用法律，及選用仲裁作為解決商業爭議的方法。",
            "今天的論壇將為我們的未來合作，締造良好的契機。我謹此向所有合辦機構，包括支持這次論壇舉行的單位和機構，包括廣東省人民政府、廣東省高級人民法院以及多個市的司法部門和律師協會，致以衷心的感謝。還有，我也感謝各位發言嘉賓，和出席論壇的每一位朋友。",
            "最後，我祝願論壇成功舉行、成果豐碩。謝謝各位。",
            "註一︰其他合辦機構為：香港貿易發展局、香港大律師公會、香港律師會、香港國際仲裁中心以及國際商會國際仲裁院。",
