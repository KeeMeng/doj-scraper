            "The Government will introduce legislative amendments to clarify that third party funding of arbitration and mediation is not prohibited by the common law doctrines of maintenance and champerty. The proposed amendments to the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) and the Mediation Ordinance (Cap 620) will also provide for related measures and safeguards by setting out the standards and practices (including financial and ethical standards) with which third party funders would generally be expected to comply when carrying on activities in connection with third party funding of arbitration and mediation.",
            "A spokesman for the Department of Justice today (December 28) said that the proposed amendments were formulated on the basis of the recommendations made in the Report on Third Party Funding for Arbitration published by the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong in October 2016 and the views of the Steering Committee on Mediation.",
            "Third party funding of arbitration and other dispute resolution proceedings has become increasingly common over the last decade in numerous jurisdictions, including Australia, England and Wales, various European jurisdictions and the United States. To date, third party funding arrangements have usually been motivated by a funded party's lack of financial resources to pursue its own claims in contentious proceedings. However, increasingly, parties who do have the financial resources to fund contentious proceedings may also seek third party funding as a financial or risk management tool.",
            "The courts in Hong Kong do not object, in principle, to third party funding of arbitration and related proceedings (including mediation). However, it is unclear whether the common law doctrines of maintenance and champerty also apply to third party funding of arbitration taking place in Hong Kong. Indeed, a Court of Final Appeal judgment handed down in 2007 expressly left open this question.",
            "\"It is likely that a party to an arbitration or mediation taking place in Hong Kong may wish to consider whether or not it should seek third party funding of its participation in such an arbitration or mediation if it is clearly permitted by Hong Kong law to do so. We therefore believe the amendments will attract more arbitrations to be conducted in Hong Kong, and thus will further enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as a leading international dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region,\" the spokesman said.",
            "The Arbitration and Mediation Legislation (Third Party Funding) (Amendment) Bill 2016, which contains the above amendments, will be gazetted this Friday (December 30) and introduced into the Legislative Council on January 11, 2017.",

            "過去十年，第三者資助仲裁及其他爭議解決程序在多個司法管轄區，包括澳大利亞、英格蘭及威爾斯、歐洲多個司法管轄區，以及美國等，日益普遍。至今，採用第三者資助安排，通常是因為受資助方缺乏財務資源，無法透過爭訟法律程序提出自己的申索。然而，越來越多當事人即使具備財務資源來為爭訟法律程序出資，也會要求第三者資助作為財務或風險管理工具。",
            "香港的法院原則上並不反對第三者資助仲裁及相關法律程序（包括調解）。然而，助訟及包攬訴訟的普通法原則是否也適用於在香港進行的第三者資助仲裁，目前的情況並不清晰。實際上，終審法院在二○○七年頒下的一項判決中明言對這個問題未下定論。",
            "發言人說：「如果香港法律明確准許第三者資助仲裁或調解，參與在香港進行仲裁或調解的當事方可能會考慮應否尋求第三者資助。因此，我們相信有關修訂將吸引更多仲裁在香港進行，因而會進一步鞏固香港作為亞太區主要國際爭議解決服務中心的競爭力。」",
