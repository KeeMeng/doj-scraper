            "The \"Mediate First\" Pledge Event 2021 was held online today (May 28) by the Department of Justice (DoJ) to promote the use of mediation in Hong Kong's various sectors for dispute resolution, complementing the DoJ's long-term policy efforts to promote and develop the wider use of mediation. The event attracted more than 1 300 participants from different sectors of 14 jurisdictions around the globe.",
            "The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, said that the DoJ has spared no effort in promoting mediation both locally and internationally. The relevant work includes the Mediation Mechanism established under the Investment Agreement of the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement for the settlement of investment disputes; the Investment Law and Investor-State Mediator Training Course in Hong Kong co-organised with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes and the Asian Academy of International Law; working closely with the Department of Justice of Guangdong Province and the Secretariat for Administration and Justice of the Macao Special Administrative Region in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area Legal Departments Joint Conference on the establishment of a GBA Mediation Platform; and the Small Claims Mediation Pilot Scheme at the West Kowloon Mediation Centre which provides mediation services to litigants of the Small Claims Tribunal cases.",

This year, a total of 34 pledgees are awarded the Star Logo for their achievements in promoting and adopting mediation in the course of their business operations.",
            "Organisations and individuals signing the \"Mediate First\" Pledge agree to first explore the use of mediation to resolve disputes arising in the course of their business dealings and operations, before pursuing other dispute resolution processes or court litigation.",
