            "The Inter-departmental Working Group (IWG) on Gender Recognition today (June 23) released a consultation paper on gender recognition following its detailed study on recognition issues and invited views from the community on the issues.",
            "A spokesman for the IWG said, \"The subject of gender recognition involves legal, medical, social and human rights issues which are complicated and controversial, and may have wide-ranging policy implications. It is evident from developments overseas that different jurisdictions have adopted different approaches to deal with these issues.\"",
            "The Consultation Paper: Part 1 on Gender Recognition seeks the views of the community on a number of issues concerning legal gender recognition, including whether a gender recognition scheme should be established in Hong Kong and, if so, the contents of the scheme.",
            "\"Given the controversial nature of the issues involved, the IWG maintains an open mind and does not have any preferred position at this moment. Accordingly, the consultation paper seeks to discuss the relevant issues as objectively as possible so as to invite views from the community,\" he added.",
            "There is currently no legislation in Hong Kong which provides for the recognition of the reassigned, acquired or preferred gender of a person for all legal purposes. Government departments and private institutions are not required by law to accept the sex entry on a person's Hong Kong identity card as that person's legal gender. Neither is there any mechanism to have the sex entry on a person’s birth certificate amended to reflect his or her reassigned, acquired or preferred gender.",
            "At present, through services provided by the Hospital Authority, there are a range of treatment options available in Hong Kong for people having gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria. These include:",
            "In May 2013, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ruled in W v Registrar of Marriages (W's case) that a transsexual person who had undergone full SRS should be entitled to marry a person of the sex opposite to his or her reassigned sex. The CFA also commented on the problems facing transsexual persons in other areas of law, as well as the treatment of persons who have not undertaken any SRS or have not fully completed SRS. The CFA observed that the Government should consider how to address problems facing transsexual persons in all areas of law by drawing reference to overseas law and practice, such as the United Kingdom's Gender Recognition Act 2004.",
            "In response, the IWG was set up in January 2014 to follow up on the observations of the CFA. It is tasked to consider legislation and incidental administrative measures that may be required to protect the rights of transsexual persons in Hong Kong in all legal contexts and to make such recommendations for reform as may be appropriate.",
            "Chaired by the Secretary for Justice, the IWG comprises representatives from relevant policy bureaux including the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, the Security Bureau and the Food and Health Bureau, as well as two non-official members from the legal sector.",
            "The work of the IWG has been divided into two parts - Recognition and Post-recognition. For Part 1 on Gender Recognition, the subject of the current consultation paper, the IWG has conducted research on matters relating to transgender or transsexual persons, both in Hong Kong and internationally.",
            "The IWG has also undertaken a comparative study of the legislation, schemes and case law on gender recognition in over 100 jurisdictions, as well as the standards of international bodies in this area. This study has found that there are different approaches adopted in other jurisdictions regarding gender recognition, including whether the recognition scheme is statutory, administrative or judicial; the pre-conditions for granting recognition in some form; and the legal implications once recognition is granted. Examples of such models include, but are not limited to, the following:",
            "(1) a model which includes a wide range of requirements like SRS, medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, marital status exclusion, etc;",
            "(2) a surgery-requiring model, but with fewer other medical evidence requirements, though including certain other restrictions, such as marital status exclusion;",
            "(3) a surgery-free but otherwise detailed model requiring medical evidence, such as proof of diagnosis of gender dysphoria or transsexualism and proof of real life test; and",
            "(4) a self-declaration model, which allows change of gender identity by means of the applicant submitting a specific declaration self-identifying in a particular gender without any medical intervention requirements, personal status restrictions or any procedural complexity.",
            "It should be noted that other issues - such as same-sex marriage, civil partnership and discrimination against sexual minorities - are outside the scope of the IWG's study.",
            "Specifically, views of the public are invited on a number of issues which include:",
            "(a) whether a gender recognition scheme should be established in Hong Kong;",
            "(b) the criteria for determining whether a person is eligible for gender recognition (which may include residential requirements, minimum age, marital status and the number of years the person has lived in the reassigned, acquired or preferred gender); and",
            "(c) the procedure for gender recognition (including the medical and evidential requirements, what type of authority should be given the power to determine applications for gender recognition and whether foreign gender recognition decisions should be recognised).",
            "After studying the results of the public consultation, the IWG will proceed to the second part of the study concerning the impact of gender recognition on existing laws and practice in the event that a gender recognition scheme is to be established in Hong Kong.",
            "The public consultation exercise will close on October 31, 2017. Members of the public may send in their views to the Secretary, Inter-departmental Working Group on Gender Recognition (5/F, East Wing, Justice Place, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central) by mail, by fax (3918 4799) or by email (",

            "在進行詳細研究後，性別承認跨部門工作小組（工作小組）今日（六月二十三日）發表關於性別承認的諮詢文件，並就性別承認議題徵求社會各界的意見。",
            "工作小組發言人說：「性別承認涉及法律、醫療、社會和人權議題，複雜和具爭議性，亦可能涉及廣泛的政策影響。海外的發展顯示，不同的司法管轄區對這些議題採取不同的處理方法。」",
            "《諮詢文件：第1部分：性別承認》旨在徵詢社會各界對法律上性別承認等多個議題的意見，包括應否在香港設立性別承認制度，以及若設立的話，該制度應包括甚麼內容。",
            "發言人說：「鑑於議題的爭議性，工作小組目前仍持開放態度，沒有既定立場。因此，諮詢文件盡可能客觀地討論相關議題，以徵求社會各界的意見。」",
            "目前，香港並無法例讓一個人就所有法律目的而言，承認其重置的、後天取得的或屬意的性別。法律亦沒有規定政府部門和私人機構必須接受某人香港身份證上所標示的性別作為該人的法律性別。此外，目前並無任何機制可讓人申請修改其出生證書上的性別，以反映其重置的、後天取得的或屬意的性別。",
            "在香港，醫院管理局透過其服務，為患有性別認同障礙或性別不安的人士提供多項治療方案。這些方案包括：",
            "二○一三年五月，終審法院在W訴婚姻登記官案（W案）中裁定，已接受整項性別重置手術的變性人士有權與性別異於其重置性別的人結婚。終審法院也提及變性人士在其他法律範疇所面對的困難，以及如何看待沒有接受任何性別重置手術或沒有完成整項性別重置手術的人士。終審法院認為政府應參考諸如英國的《2004年性別承認法令》（Gender Recognition Act 2004）的外國法律和模式，以研究香港該如何妥善解決變性人士在所有法律範疇所面對的困難。",
            "政府隨後於二○一四年一月成立工作小組，以跟進上述終審法院的意見。工作小組的職權是研究全面保障在香港變性人士的法律權利所可能需要的法例和相關行政措施，並作出合適的改革建議。",
            "工作小組由律政司司長擔任主席，成員來自相關決策局的代表，包括政制及內地事務局、保安局和食物及衞生局的代表，以及兩位來自法律界的非官守成員。",
            "工作小組的工作分為兩部分，分別為性別承認和性別承認後的事宜。就第一部分的性別承認方面，工作小組探討了在香港及海外與跨性別人士或變性人士有關的事宜。",
            "工作小組亦比較了超過一百個司法管轄區關於性別承認的法例、制度和案例，以及不同國際組織在這方面訂立的準則。這項比較研究顯示其他司法管轄區在性別承認方面採用的處理方式有很多不同之處：性別承認制度有些是法定的、行政的或司法的；有些會列明給予某種形式的性別承認的先決條件；給予性別承認後的法律影響也不盡相同。這些不同模式的例子包括但不限於︰",
            "（一）含有較多限制的模式，例如要求申請人已進行性別重置手術、提交性別不安的醫學診斷證明、排除已婚人士的申請等；",
            "（二）規定須接受手術的模式，但較少其他醫學證據方面的規定，但仍有若干其他限制，例如排除已婚人士申請；",
            "（三）無須接受手術但需較多醫學證據的模式：例如規定申請人須提供醫學證據，例如性別不安或易性症的診斷證明、「實際生活體驗」的證明等；以及",
            "（四）自我聲明模式，准許申請人藉提交特定的聲明（聲明自己屬某一性別）便可更改其性別身分，而不設任何醫療干預或個人身分的限制，也不涉任何複雜的程序。",
            "需留意的是，諸如同性婚姻、民事伴侶關係及針對性小眾的歧視行為等事宜，並不在工作小組研究範圍之內。",
            "具體而言，諮詢公眾意見的議題包括：",
            "（一）應否在香港設立性別承認制度；",
            "（二）申請性別承認的人所需符合的資格準則（這可能包括居港年期、年齡下限、婚姻狀況及該人以重置的、後天取得的或屬意的性別生活的年期等規定）；以及；",
            "（三）性別承認的程序（包括醫學上及證據方面的規定、哪類型的主管當局有權決定性別承認的申請、應否承認外國就性別承認所作的決定等）。",
            "工作小組分析公眾諮詢結果後，將進行第二部分研究，探討若在香港設立性別承認制度，將對現行法律和措施可能衍生的影響。",
            "公眾諮詢將於二○一七年十月三十一日結束。公眾人士可郵遞（地址：中環下亞厘畢道十八號律政中心東座五樓）、傳真（3918 4799）或電郵（",
