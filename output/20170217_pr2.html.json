            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at a media session on comments on judge expressed in social media after the Legislative Council meeting today (February 17):",
            "Reporter: ...Is it a contempt of court case for anyone to call a judge a \"dog\"…… insult….?",
            "Secretary for Justice: : As I was saying in Cantonese just now, it would not be appropriate for me, at this stage, to comment on any specific incident or any specific speech or conduct of any individual. But if I may stress again that, as I said at the Opening of the Legal Year, that it would be the liberty of people of Hong Kong and their right as guaranteed under the constitution to comment on the verdicts and judgment made by judges and the court. But such constitutional right has to be exercised within the limit. As I was quoting the speeches of the former Chief Justice, Mr Andrew Li, he was saying that in exercising such constitutional right, people should do it responsibly. And I was saying just now and also on previous occasions that, in order to exercising this right responsibly, one would have to be doing it rationally, fairly and not beyond the limit permitted by the law. And therefore we would urge people that in discussing whatever decisions by the court or the verdict by the court, and irrespective of one's views on the decisions, one should follow the rules as laid down by the law and do it responsibly. Otherwise it would not be conductive to constructive discussions of the cases as decided by the judge. As you would have appreciated from the news yesterday, the Judiciary has expressed serious concern about certain people's speeches and conduct through the social media, and the Judiciary has already referred the case to the Department of Justice. Yesterday afternoon I can confirm that we have already received the relevant document from the Judiciary. We would follow up on the matter conscientiously. If necessary and where appropriate, we would have no hesitation in commencing the necessary proceedings, including judicial or legal proceedings.",

            "記者：司長，想問問在網上，高志森罵法官這樣判「七警案」是「狗官」的所為，你如何看待這種言論？有沒有法律責任要承擔？",
            "律政司司長：暫時我不方便評論個別事件。但正如我剛才回應議員發言時，亦強調我早於今年一月九日，在法律年度開啟典禮上，已經重申希望大家不要就一些司法裁決或法官判決，作一些過於政治化或不恰當的批評，亦解釋了理由。如果大家有留意的話，當日，時任大律師公會主席譚允芝及新任主席林定國亦在他的《香港家書》裡發表過類似的意見。我們一直強調市民或社會大眾對司法判決或法官的言行，有他們批評或評論的自由，這正如李國能法官都曾解釋，是憲法賦予社會大眾的一個權利，但正如其他一些憲法賦予我們的權利，不是完全沒有限制。在談論或評論法官的判決時，亦應在法律框架下進行，包括不可以作侮辱性或構成藐視法庭的言行。若有超越這些法律界線，或構成藐視法庭的言行，不單對事件沒幫助，亦對市民以理性的態度來瞭解或討論法官的決定，是沒有任何幫助外，相關人士亦可能犯上藐視法庭或其他法律責任。昨日大家都在新聞中見到，就今次事件，司法機構就部分社會人士在社交媒體上發表的言論，表示高度關注，亦就事件正式轉介律政司跟進，我們昨日下午亦已收到司法機構向我們轉介處理這事件的文件，我們會與有關方面跟進這件事。我希望在此重申，正如剛才我發言時亦說過，在合適和有需要時，我們絕對不會猶豫採取適當的跟進措施，包括如果有充分理由時，會展開相關司法程序。",
