            "The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) conducted a comprehensive investigation into allegations of corruption and misconduct in public office (MIPO) against former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Mr Leung Chun-ying and member of the Legislative Council Mr Holden Chow Ho-ding. The allegations arose from (i) Mr Leung entering into an agreement with UGL Limited (UGL) and receiving payments thereunder during the time when he was the Chief Executive and (ii) suspected interference by Mr Leung and Mr Chow with the inquiry of the Select Committee to Inquire into the Matters about the Agreement between Mr Leung Chun-ying and the Australian firm UGL Limited (the Select Committee).",
            "Having carefully considered the investigation reports and the relevant materials submitted by the ICAC, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has advised that there is insufficient evidence to institute prosecution against Mr Leung and Mr Chow.",
            "Prosecution criteria",
            "According to the Prosecution Code, a prosecutor must consider two issues in deciding whether to prosecute. First, whether there is sufficient evidence to justify instituting or continuing proceedings. Second, if there is sufficient evidence, whether the public interest requires a prosecution to be pursued. A prosecution should not be instituted or continued unless the prosecutor is satisfied that there is legally sufficient evidence to support a prosecution: that is, evidence that is admissible and reliable and, together with any reasonable inference able to be drawn from it, likely to prove the offence. The test is whether the evidence demonstrates a reasonable prospect of conviction. In the present case, the decision not to prosecute is solely based upon insufficiency of evidence.",
            "DoJ's decision",
            "The available evidence reveals that in late 2011, Mr Leung, a director of DTZ Holdings (DTZ), in the negotiation of the takeover of DTZ by UGL, entered into an agreement with UGL for the receipt of £4 million on the basis of \"non-compete non-poach\". Part of the sum was received when Mr Leung was the Chief Executive.",
            "The totality of the evidence is that as part of the arrangement of the takeover, DTZ had knowledge of Mr Leung entering into agreement with and accepting money from UGL for Mr Leung's non-compete non-poach arrangements. Furthermore, Mr Leung's acts in negotiating the takeover with UGL were congruent with the interests of DTZ which was at the relevant time in financial difficulties. The evidence fell short of establishing DTZ did not consent to Mr Leung accepting the monies or that the conduct fell within the mischief of an agent accepting advantage charge within section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, Cap 201. There is no reasonable prospect of conviction of a corruption charge against Mr Leung.",
            "As to the absence of declaration of such interests to the relevant authorities, since there is no conflict of interest on the part of Mr Leung, there was no legal requirement for him to make declaration of the amount that he was to receive under the agreement with UGL entered into before he became the Chief Executive. The absence of declaration hence did not constitute any MIPO offence.",
            "Regarding the submission of amendments to the major area of studies of the Select Committee by Mr Chow which originated from Mr Leung, the amendments would not affect the proper functioning of the Select Committee. There is insufficient evidence to prove that such misconduct was serious enough to establish the offence of MIPO.",
            "For the sake of completeness, there is also insufficient evidence to substantiate other criminal offences against Mr Leung or Mr Chow.",
            "The DoJ's decision not to institute prosecution against Mr Leung and Mr Chow has been made in accordance with the Prosecution Code and the applicable law.",
            "The decision taken has been explained so that the public are fully and properly informed about this case which has been the subject of public concern.",

            "廉政公署已就有關香港特別行政區前行政長官梁振英及立法會議員周浩鼎的涉嫌貪污及公職人員行為失當指控作出全面調查。有關指控源於（一）梁振英與UGL Limited（UGL）簽訂協議，及在他擔任行政長官期間接受該公司的款項；及（二）梁振英及周浩鼎涉嫌介入「調查梁振英先生與澳洲企業UGL Limited所訂協議的事宜專責委員會」（「專責委員會」）的調查。",
            "律政司仔細考慮廉政公署提交的調查報告及相關資料後，認為沒有足夠證據對梁振英和周浩鼎提出檢控。",
            "檢控準則",
            "根據《檢控守則》，檢控人員在決定應否提出檢控時須考慮兩大問題：第一，是否有充分證據支持提出和繼續進行檢控。第二，若有充分證據，進行檢控是否符合公眾利益。除非檢控人員信納在法律上有充分證據支持提出檢控，即這些可接納和可靠的證據，連同可從相關證據作出的合理推論，有相當機會能證明有關罪行，否則不應提出或繼續進行檢控。而驗證標準則為是否有合理機會達致定罪。就本案而言，不對上述人士提出檢控的決定完全是建基於證據不足的考慮。",
            "律政司的決定",
            "現有證據顯示，於二○一一年年底，戴德梁行董事梁振英就UGL收購戴德梁行進行談判時，與UGL簽訂協議，收取400萬英鎊以「不作競爭、不作挖角」。部分款項是在梁振英擔任行政長官時收取的。",
            "所有證據顯示，作為收購安排的一部分，戴德梁行知悉梁振英與UGL簽訂協議並接受UGL的款項以「不作競爭、不作挖角」。 此外，梁振英與UGL就有關UGL收購戴德梁行的談判亦符合戴德梁行的利益，因戴德梁行當時正面對財政困難。由於證據未能確立戴德梁行不同意梁振英接受這些款項，或該行為屬於《防止賄賂條例》（第201章）第9條所針對代理人接受利益的罪行，故此，並沒有合理機會就有關梁振英貪污的控罪達致定罪。",
            "至於沒有向有關當局申報利益的指控，由於梁振英沒有利益衝突，因此沒有法律規定需要申報他在成為行政長官之前，與UGL所簽訂協議而會獲得款項的金額。故此，沒有申報並不構成任何公職人員行為失當罪。",
            "有關周浩鼎提交「專責委員會」關於主要研究範疇的修訂來自梁振英，這些修訂並不會影響「專責委員會」的正常運作。故此，沒有足夠證據證明這種不當行為嚴重至足以構成公職人員行為失當罪。",
            "此外，為了完整起見，案中也沒有足夠的證據可證實梁振英和周浩鼎觸犯其他刑事罪行。",
            "律政司不對梁振英和周浩鼎提出檢控的決定，是依據《檢控守則》和適用法律而作出的。",
            "律政司對上述案件的決定作出解釋，讓市民對這宗公眾關注的案件有全面和充分的了解。",
