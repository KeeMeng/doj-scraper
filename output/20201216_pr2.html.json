            "Following is a question by Dr the Hon Priscilla Leung and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (December 16):",
            "Question:",
            "The Court of Final Appeal handed down a judgment on May 18, 2015, which held that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the Foundation) was to hold the estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang (the estate) as a trustee, rather than receiving the estate as an unconditional absolute gift; moreover, the Secretary for Justice (SJ) and the Foundation's Board of Governors were required to formulate an administration scheme for the estate, including the establishment of a supervisory managing organisation, to ensure that the estate would be used for charitable purposes in accordance with the testamentary intention of Mrs Wang. Nevertheless, it has been over five years since the judgment was handed down, but the supervisory managing organisation has yet to be established and the estate is still under the administration of the interim administrators of the estate appointed by the Court (the administrators). It has been reported that the administrators collect from the estate a fee as high as $60 million per annum. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it knows the total current value of the estate, the total amount of fees charged by the administrators and relevant parties since 2012, as well as the amount appropriated from the estate for charitable purposes in each of the past three years;",
            "(2) how SJ, as the protector of charities, monitors if the expenses for the estate are reasonable and necessary, so as to ensure that the estate will not be gnawed by the exorbitant management fees, thus causing a significant reduction in its resources that may be used for charitable purposes; and",
            "(3) whether SJ will request the Foundation to expedite its handling of the matters relating to the establishment of the supervisory managing organisation, so that the estate may expeditiously be used for charitable purposes, including helping members of the public affected by the epidemic?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "In relation to the estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang (Estate), I provided a detailed written response to a relevant question at the Legislative Council on May 29, 2019 about the latest developments regarding the scheme of administration (Scheme) and the work of the interim administrators. The Secretary for Justice (SJ), as the protector of charities, is necessarily a party to charity proceedings and represents the beneficial interest or objects of the charity. The relevant legal proceedings could be taken forward in a reasonable time only with the co-operation of all parties, but not just SJ as necessarily a party to charity proceedings, and their active follow-up with the Court's directions and orders.",
            "The role of SJ is to protect charitable interests but charities are generally allowed to operate autonomously under their own governing articles and in accordance with their own rules or regulations. Except otherwise prescribed by law or ordered by the Court, the charity may operate autonomously and decide the manner in which the public is to be informed about its operation. SJ does not participate in a charity's decision and arrangement to make donations to others for charitable purposes, and has no power to direct any charity to make donations.",
            "In relation to Dr the Hon Priscilla Leung's questions, I now reply as follows:",
            "(1) and (2) The Department of Justice (DoJ) has all along been paying close attention to the interim administrators' work in managing and preserving the Estate, and take such follow-up actions as may be appropriate.",
            "In relation to the information about the Estate, the DoJ has sought updates from the parties concerned. With their consent, information which can be disclosed is set out below:",
            "The core assets of the Estate comprise the assets of the companies in the Chinachem Group. Based on the relevant unaudited combined management accounts, as at September 30, 2020, the Chinachem Group has a net asset value of about HK$141 billion. According to the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal dated May 18, 2015 (CFA judgment), the Chinachem Group was valued in 2012 at over HK$82 billion.",
            "On the other hand, during the period from 2018 to 2020 (up till November 30, 2020), the Chinachem Group has in each year made donations for charitable purposes to different charities and other entities at the aggregate sum of over HK$26.6 million. During the aforesaid period, the annual donations made were about HK$5.5 million, HK$11.65 million and HK$9.45 million respectively.",
            "The fees of the interim administrators have been prescribed by the Court in the Appointment Order and are subject to the Court's scrutiny. As the relevant order was made at a hearing not open to public, without the Court's order for disclosure, we are not in a position to disclose such information. The DoJ will continue to follow up as appropriate so as to ensure that the interim administrators' fees are maintained at a reasonable level.",
            "(3) As stated in my preamble, although SJ, as the protector of charities, is necessarily a party to charity proceedings and represents the beneficial interest or objects of the charity, except otherwise prescribed by law or ordered by the Court, charities are generally allowed to operate autonomously under their own governing articles and in accordance with their own rules or regulations, and decide the manner in which the public is to be informed about its operation. Hence, even when the Court has approved the Scheme and appointed members to the supervising managing organisation, SJ has no power to direct the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (Foundation) or the Chinachem Group to make donations for charitable purposes, including providing assistance to citizens affected by the epidemic.",
            "The DoJ has been actively following up the blueprint of the Scheme as laid down in the CFA Judgment on May 18, 2015, and has provided recommendations therein. The DoJ has been in contact with the Foundation's responsible persons to discuss the detailed arrangements of the Scheme, with a view to completing the relevant tasks as soon as possible. The DoJ had made an application to the Court on March 29, 2019 in respect of the relevant matters in order to seek the Court's determination or directions for the DoJ to proceed to complete the remaining tasks. The Court held the first directions hearing on June 13, 2019. The Foundation, being one of the parties to the proceedings, was directed to file its affirmation by October 31 of the same year. As a result of the Foundation's failure to file the relevant affirmation after a few extensions of deadline, the DoJ made an application to the Court on May 6, 2020, requesting the Foundation to file its affirmation. At another hearing on May 26, 2020, the Court ordered that unless the Foundation could file an affirmation within 56 days, it would be debarred from filing evidence so that the proceedings could continue to progress. The Foundation eventually filed its affirmation on July 17, 2020. The interim administrators filed their relevant affirmations on December 7, 2020 after a few extensions of deadline. At present, the next step is for the Foundation to file its affirmation(s) in reply. After the Foundation's filing of its affirmation(s) in reply, the DoJ shall file its affirmation(s) in reply. Upon the completion of evidence, the Court will hold another directions hearing on May 26, 2021.",
            "I must point out that the DoJ has all along been acting expeditiously in the relevant legal proceedings. The DoJ will continue to closely follow up in order to ensure the early preparation and implementation of the Scheme, and to handle the Estate in accordance with the wishes of the late Mrs Nina Wang.",
            "We will also actively follow up the detailed arrangements for the implementation of the will, including handling the court proceedings already commenced and closely monitoring the management and preservation of the Estate with a view to protecting and safeguarding the relevant charitable interest. Thank you, President.",

            "以下是今日（十二月十六日）在立法會會議上梁美芬議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "終審法院於二○一五年五月十八日頒下判決，裁定華懋慈善基金（下稱「基金」）是以受託人身分持有已故龔如心女士的遺產（下稱「該遺產」），而不是以無條件饋贈形式接收該遺產；此外，律政司司長和基金董事會須就該遺產制訂管理計劃，包括成立監管機構，以確保該遺產按龔女士的遺願作慈善用途。然而，判決頒下至今已五年多，但該監管機構尚未成立，而該遺產仍由法庭委任的臨時遺產管理人（下稱「管理人」）管理。據報，該管理人每年從該遺產支取高達6,000萬元的收費。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）是否知悉，該遺產現時的總值、管理人及相關人士由二○一二年至今的收費總額，以及過去三年每年從該遺產撥出作慈善用途的款額；",
            "（二）律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，如何監察該遺產的開支屬合理和必要，以確保該遺產不會被高昂的管理費蠶食，致使其可作慈善用途的資源大幅減少；及",
            "（三）律政司司長會否要求基金加快處理成立監管機構的事宜，令該遺產可盡快用於慈善用途，包括幫助受疫情影響的市民？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "有關已故龔如心女士的遺產（該筆遺產）的事宜，本人去年五月二十九日在立法會就相關提問作出了詳盡書面回覆，當中交代了有關遺囑管理計劃（管理計劃）的最新發展及有關臨時遺產管理人的工作。律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，是慈善法律程序的必然一方，並且代表慈善組織的實際權益或宗旨。除律政司司長作慈善法律程序的必然一方外，相關法律程序需要與訟各方同樣配合，積極跟進法庭的指示和命令，讓有關法律程序能在合理的速度下進行。",
            "律政司司長的角色是維護慈善利益，但一般而言，各類慈善組織在各自的決策組織下，按照本身的組織章程大綱和章程細則獨立運作。除法例另有規定或法庭另有命令外，有關慈善組織自行運作和決定如何向公眾作出交代，律政司司長不會參與慈善團體向其他人士或組織捐款作慈善用途的決定及安排，亦沒有權力指令慈善團體作出捐款。",
            "就梁美芬議員的提問，我現回覆如下：",
            "（一）及（二）律政司一直密切關注臨時遺產管理人就龔如心女士遺產的管理和保存的工作，並在有需要時作出適當的跟進。",
            "就該筆遺產的資料，律政司已向有關人士索取更新資料。經取得他們的同意，現將可以公開的資料載列如下：",
            "該筆遺產的核心資產包括華懋集團內各公司的資產。按有關未經審核的合計管理報表，截至今年九月三十日，華懋集團的資產淨值約為港幣1,410億元。根據終審法院二○一五年五月十八日頒下的判決中披露，華懋集團於二○一二年的資產值約超過港幣820億元。",
            "此外，在二○一八至二○二○年期間（截至今年十一月三十日），華懋集團每年均向不同的慈善機構及其他單位捐款作慈善用途，總額超過港幣2,660萬元。在上述期間，每年捐出總額分別為約港幣550萬元、港幣1,165萬元及港幣945萬元。",
            "關於臨時遺產管理人的費用問題，在法庭的委任命令經已有所規定，並受法庭的監督。由於有關命令是在非公開的聆訊作出，在法庭沒有頒令披露的情況下，我們不能透露有關資料。律政司會繼續作出適當跟進，以確保臨時遺產管理人的費用維持在合理的水平。",
            "（三）正如我引言所述，儘管律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，是慈善法律程序的必然一方，並且代表慈善組織的實際權益或宗旨，但一般而言，除法例另有規定或法庭另有命令外，有關慈善組織在各自的決策組織下，可以按照本身的組織章程大綱和章程自行運作，以及決定如何向公眾作出交代。因此，即使管理計劃已經獲法院批准，並已由法院委任監管機構成員，律政司司長亦沒有權力指令華懋慈善基金有限公司（華懋慈善基金）或華懋集團作出捐款用於慈善用途，包括幫助受疫情影響的市民。",
            "律政司一直積極跟進終審法院二○一五年五月十八日判詞中就管理計劃設定的藍圖，並已就該管理計劃作出建議，律政司一直與華懋慈善基金負責人商討擬備管理計劃的各具體事項，希望能盡快完成有關工作。律政司於二○一九年三月二十九日就管理計劃的相關事宜向法庭提交申請，以尋求法庭的裁決或指示，讓律政司繼續完成餘下的工作。法庭已於去年六月十三日進行首次指示聆訊。與訟的其中一方即華懋慈善基金須於同年十月三十一日提交誓章。在數次延期後，華懋慈善基金仍未提交有關誓章。律政司因此於今年五月六日就此向法庭提出申請，要求華懋慈善基金提交誓章。法庭於五月二十六日的另一聆訊中頒令，除非華懋慈善基金在其後五十六日內提交誓章，否則將不能在訴訟中提交證據以使程序繼續獲得進展。華懋慈善基金最終於今年七月十七日提交有關誓章。臨時遺產管理人亦在數次延期後於十二月七日提交有關誓章。現時，下一步將由華懋慈善基金提交回覆誓章。待華懋慈善基金提交回覆誓章後，律政司將提交回覆誓章。法庭會在證據程序完畢後，於明年五月二十六日再進行指示聆訊。",
            "我必須指出，律政司在有關法律程序中一直迅速行事。律政司將會繼續密切跟進有關情況，以確保能盡快擬定及執行管理計劃，按龔如心女士的遺願處理該筆遺產。",
            "我們亦會繼續積極跟進實施遺囑內容的具體安排，包括處理已展開的法庭程序及繼續密切留意該筆遺產的管理和保存，以維護及保障相關的慈善利益。多謝主席。",

            "律政司一直積極跟進終審法院二○一五年五月十八日判詞中就管理計劃設定的藍圖，並已就該管理計劃作出建議，律政司一直與華懋慈善基金負責人商討擬備管理計劃的各具體事項，希望能盡快完成有關工作",
            "律政司於二○一九年三月二十九日就管理計劃的相關事宜向法庭提交申請，以尋求法庭的裁決或指示，讓律政司繼續完成餘下的工作",
            "法庭已於去年六月十三日進行首次指示聆訊",
            "與訟的其中一方即華懋慈善基金須於同年十月三十一日提交誓章",
            "在數次延期後，華懋慈善基金仍未提交有關誓章",
            "律政司因此於今年五月六日就此向法庭提出申請，要求華懋慈善基金提交誓章",
            "法庭於五月二十六日的另一聆訊中頒令，除非華懋慈善基金在其後五十六日內提交誓章，否則將不能在訴訟中提交證據以使程序繼續獲得進展",
            "華懋慈善基金最終於今年七月十七日提交有關誓章",
            "臨時遺產管理人亦在數次延期後於十二月七日提交有關誓章",
            "現時，下一步將由華懋慈善基金提交回覆誓章",
            "待華懋慈善基金提交回覆誓章後，律政司將提交回覆誓章",
            "法庭會在證據程序完畢後，於明年五月二十六日再進行指示聆訊",
            "我必須指出，律政司在有關法律程序中一直迅速行事",
            "律政司將會繼續密切跟進有關情況，以確保能盡快擬定及執行管理計劃，按龔如心女士的遺願處理該筆遺產",
            "我們亦會繼續積極跟進實施遺囑內容的具體安排，包括處理已展開的法庭程序及繼續密切留意該筆遺產的管理和保存，以維護及保障相關的慈善利益",
            "多謝主席",
            "2020年12月16日（星期三）"
