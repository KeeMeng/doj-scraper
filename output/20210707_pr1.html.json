            "A spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) said today (July 7) that the Government will introduce the Legal Practitioners (Amendment) Bill 2021 into the Legislative Council (LegCo) to enable legal officers who are not barristers, upon satisfying the relevant eligibility requirements, to be eligible for appointment as Senior Counsel (SC).",
            "According to section 31A(1) of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap. 159) (LPO), only barristers are eligible to be appointed as SC. Under the current regime, legal officers who are not admitted as barristers (for example those admitted as solicitors) are not eligible for appointment as SC even if they take up the same amount of advocacy work as those who are barristers, and satisfy the substantive eligibility requirements stipulated in section 31A(2) of the LPO.",
            "The DoJ proposes to amend section 31A of the LPO so that a person (not being a barrister) who holds office as a legal officer (as defined by section 2 of the Legal Officers Ordinance (LOO) and including a person deemed to be a legal officer for the purposes of the LOO) is eligible to be appointed as an SC upon satisfaction of the relevant eligibility requirements. The key justifications include:",
            "(1) There has always been no practical distinction between the duties of legal officers who are barristers and those who are not, and the proposal allows those who satisfy the substantive eligibility requirements but are not admitted as barristers to receive a fair recognition;",
            "(2) The proposal aligns with the merit-based selection principle and is in the public interest. According to section 31A(1) of the LPO, the Chief Justice may, after consultation with the chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association and the president of the Law Society of Hong Kong, appoint as SC barristers who satisfy the eligibility requirements. The proposal is also conducive to the Chief Justice's exercise of discretion to appoint, based on ability and merits and in the interest of the public, those suitable ones (including eligible barristers in private practice and legal officers) as SC; and",
            "(3) The proposal does not affect any rights of the legal practitioners in the private sector (including the opportunities for barristers in private practice to be appointed as SC), nor disturb the professional demarcation between the barristers' and solicitors' branches as legal services providers. Under the proposal, a legal officer (non-barrister) appointed as SC is only entitled to use the title of SC when holding office as a legal officer. More importantly, the proposal does not alter the selection mechanism and criteria of appointment of SC. Same as barristers in private practice, legal officers are equally required to satisfy the series of eligibility requirements under section 31A of the LPO, including possessing sufficient ability, standing and knowledge of the law and having the requisite experience, to be appointed as SC by the Chief Justice.",
            "The LegCo Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services was consulted on June 21, and expressed support for the legislative proposal. The DoJ has already briefed the Chief Justice and the legal sector on the legislative proposal. Organisations from the sector include the Law Society of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Bar Association and the other bodies specified for the legal subsector as provided in Annex 6 of the Schedule to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance (Cap. 569). The Law Society and some legal bodies have expressed clear support for the proposal. The DoJ will continue to engage in further communication with the Bar Association with a view to addressing its concern.",

            "根據《法律執業者條例》（第159章）第31A（1）條，只有大律師才具資格獲委任為資深大律師。在現行制度下，非大律師的律政人員（例如獲認許的律師），即使與獲認許為大律師的律政人員擔任同樣的訟辯工作，並符合《法律執業者條例》第31A（2）條訂明的實質資格規定，也不具備獲委任為資深大律師的資格。",
            "律政司建議修訂《法律執業者條例》第31A條，讓任職「律政人員」（《律政人員條例》第2條所界定者，並包括為《律政人員條例》的目的而被當作律政人員的人）而並非大律師的人，在符合相關資格規定的情況下，同樣可獲委任為資深大律師。主要理據包括：",
            "（1）律政人員一直以來並無律師或大律師的職能區分，修例建議讓符合實質資格規定但不具大律師資格的律政人員能夠得到公平的認可；",

            "（3）修例建議不會影響私人法律執業者的任何權利（包括現時私人執業大律師獲委任資深大律師的機會），亦不會干擾目前私人執業大律師和律師作為法律服務提供者的專業劃分，按建議，獲委任為資深大律師的非大律師律政人員，只在任職律政人員期間，才有權使用資深大律師的名銜。建議更不會改變有關資深大律師的甄選程序和準則，與私人執業大律師一樣，律政人員仍須同樣符合《法律執業者條例》第31A條下的一系列準則，包括有足夠能力、聲望和對法律的認識，以及具有所需的經驗等條件，才可獲終審法院首席法官委任為資深大律師。",
            "律政司已於六月二十一日徵詢立法會司法及法律事務委員會的意見，事務委員會對修例建議表示支持。律政司已向終審法院首席法官以及法律業界介紹上述修例建議，業界團體包括香港律師會、香港大律師公會及《行政長官選舉條例》（第569章）附表附件6訂明為法律界界別分組指明的其他團體。其中，律師會及一些法律團體已清晰表明支持有關建議。律政司會繼續與大律師公會就該會所關注的問題保持溝通，並作進一步解說。",
