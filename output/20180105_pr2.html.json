            "The Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam; the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC; and the Secretary for Justice (designate), Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, met the media this morning (January 5). Following are the opening remarks by Mr Yuen:",
            "Allow me to summarise what I have said in Cantonese just now in English.",
            "As pointed out by the Chief Executive just now, the Central People's Government has accepted my resignation. Today is my last day as the Secretary for Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. My resignation will take effect from tomorrow, January 6 this year.",
            "In the past five and a half years, I think Hong Kong has gone through a number of events and challenges. I am very, very privileged to have the chance to serve as the Secretary for Justice during this period.",
            "May I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to both the former Chief Executive as well as the incumbent Chief Executive for nominating me, and also my gratitude to the Central People's Government for appointing me as the Secretary for Justice during this period of time so that I have to handle all those work. May I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all the colleagues within the Government, including all the Principal Officials, as well as members of the disciplinary forces and all the colleagues in the Department of Justice. I think without their assistance and support, it would be difficult to handle many of the challenges that we faced during the past five and a half years or so.",
            "Making the decision not to continue as the Secretary for Justice is not an easy one. But I believe that at different stages of life, one should do different things.",
            "I am extremely glad that Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, is appointed as the next Secretary for Justice. With her very extensive experience and wisdom, I have every confidence that she would perform very well.",
            "On this note, if I may wish all of you and indeed the whole of Hong Kong every success in the future endeavours of Hong Kong.",

            "各位傳媒朋友：",
            "正如特首剛才所講，中央人民政府已接受我的請辭，今天是我最後一天作為香港特區的律政司司長，我的請辭明日生效。",
            "我希望藉此機會多謝前任特首和現任特首的提名，以及中央人民政府的兩次任命，令我有機會在過去約五年半的時間出任律政司司長一職。過去五年半，其實發生了很多事情，我們亦處理了很多工作。我非常感謝整個政府團隊，包括政府的所有同事、各位司、局長，當然亦包括律政司上上下下的各位同事，沒有他們的支持和協助，我相信很多事情會更難處理。",
            "不再繼續擔任律政司司長一職並非一個輕率的決定，但我相信人生在不同階段應做不同的事情。我非常高興鄭若驊女士將擔任下一位律政司司長，以她非常豐富的經驗和智慧，我絕對有信心鄭女士會非常出色地擔任這個職位。",
            "最後，我再次多謝大家在過去的支持，亦祝願各位以及整個香港，未來事事順利。",
