            "In response to media enquiries, a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) said today (October 14) as follows:",
            "By orders made on September 16, 2015, Mr Justice Au of the Court of First Instance of the High Court imposed fines totalling $550,000 by way of sentences against the proprietors/publishers as well as the editors of Apple Daily and Sharp Daily (collectively the Defendants) in contempt proceedings (HCMP 1851 & 1852 of 2013). The Defendants were also ordered to pay the costs of the Secretary for Justice (SJ) on an indemnity basis.",
            "The contempt proceedings arose from the publication on March 20, 2013 of: (1) an article respectively in the newspapers Apple Daily and Sharp Daily of an interview of Mr Henry Chau Hoi-leung, who had then been arrested and charged for double homicide; and (2) a video clip in the website of Apple Daily the interview which was conducted by two reporters of Apple Daily while Mr Chau was remanded at the Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre. The said publication was made when the criminal trial of Mr Chau was still pending.",
            "In sentencing the Defendants, Mr Justice Au stated in open court that the contempt committed was serious and the sentences had to reflect its seriousness. In imposing fines against the Defendants but not custodial sentence against any of the editors, the learned Judge was fully apprised of the relevant circumstances under which the said publication was made, as well as the relevant sentences in previous contempt cases of similar nature. In addition, the learned Judge had considered the relevant mitigating factors including: (1) an early admission of liability for contempt by the Defendants; (2) an unreserved apology; (3) a lack of any deliberate intention to interfere with a fair trial; and (4) no actual interference with the then pending criminal proceedings. Further, the fact that the editor and proprietor/publisher of Apple Daily each had one previous record of publication contempt in 1997 and 2000 respectively was duly drawn to the learned Judge's attention.",
            "After the sentences were imposed, the SJ has carefully considered whether an appeal should be lodged against the sentences in question (including the question of whether custodial sentence should be imposed against the editors in the circumstances of this case). For such purpose, the SJ has also obtained advice from independent Senior and Junior Counsel on the merits of such an appeal against the sentences.",
            "Having considered all the relevant circumstances (including the applicable legal principles, the sentences imposed in previous cases of similar nature, the evidence in the present case and independent legal advice by Senior and Junior Counsel), the SJ is satisfied that there is no sufficient basis to lodge an appeal against the sentences in question. Amongst others, there is no sufficient basis to suggest that: (1) the learned Judge had erred in law; (2) the sentences imposed by the learned Judge were outside the usual range of sentences imposed in cases of similar nature.",
            "In the circumstances, the SJ has no real alternative but decides not to lodge an appeal against the said sentences imposed by Mr Justice Au.",

            "根據在二○一五年九月十六日作出的命令，高等法院原訟法庭法官區慶祥就《蘋果日報》和《爽報》的東主／出版人及其編輯（合稱「被告人」）之藐視法庭程序（高院雜項案件2013年第1851及第1852號）判處合共550,000元的罰款作為刑罰。被告人同時被命令按彌償基準計算方式支付律政司司長的訟費。",
            "有關的藐視法庭程序源於二○一三年三月二十日（一）分別在《蘋果日報》和《爽報》刊登當時訪問周凱亮（即當時因兩宗兇殺案被拘捕及起訴的被告人）的內容；及（二）在《蘋果日報》網頁存放的一段有關《蘋果日報》記者在周凱亮還押小欖精神病治療中心期間進行採訪的短片。該等出版物出版之時，周凱亮涉及的刑事司法程序仍在進行中。",
            "法官區慶祥在公開聆訊判罰被告人時指出他們所犯的藐視法庭罪嚴重，刑罰須反映案件的嚴重性。在判處罰款而未有對編輯判處監禁時，法官已完全知悉及考慮到該等刊物出版時的相關情況及過往同類案件的判罰。此外，法官亦考慮了相關的求情因素，包括：（一）被告人很早已為藐視法庭罪承認責任；（二）被告人毫無保留的道歉；（三）被告人沒有故意影響公平審訊的意圖；及（四）當時仍在進行中的刑事司法程序沒有因此受到實際影響。另外，法官亦恰當地被知會《蘋果日報》的編輯及其東主／出版人分別於一九九七年及二○○○年曾因出版物而被裁定藐視法庭的紀錄。",
            "在判處刑罰後，律政司司長已慎重考慮應否就有關刑罰提出上訴（包括在本案的情況下應否針對編輯判處監禁的問題）。為上述目的，律政司司長亦曾就是否有足夠理據就上述刑罰提出上訴向獨立資深大律師及大律師尋求意見。",
            "經考慮所有相關因素（包括適用的法律原則、過往同類案件的刑罰、本案的證據及獨立資深大律師和大律師的法律意見），律政司司長認為沒有足夠依據就有關刑罰提出上訴，包括沒有足夠依據顯示：（一）法官犯了任何法律上的錯誤；（二）法官判處的上述刑罰偏離同類案件的正常判刑範圍。",
            "在此情況下，律政司司長別無其他可行選擇，決定不就法官區慶祥判處的上述刑罰提出上訴。",
