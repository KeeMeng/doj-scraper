            "In response to the comments from overseas politicians concerning the sentences imposed by the District Court today (April 16), the Department of Justice (DoJ) made the following statement:",
            "The case in question involves nine defendants who were jointly charged with organising and knowingly taking part in an unauthorised assembly. Two of the defendants pleaded guilty before trial while the remaining seven were convicted of all the charges by the court on April 1. The judge set out the reasons for the verdict in her judgment on the same day, which is publicly available at the Judiciary's website. In imposing the sentences today, the judge also stated the sentencing principles in court.",
            "The Government has repeatedly pointed out that where a defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty after trial, it is the court's duty to impose a just and appropriate sentence, applying the relevant principles to the circumstances of the crime and those of the offender. It is crucial that where there is any dissatisfaction over the sentences imposed by the courts, any redress ought to be taken up by means of an appeal or review.",
            "We are appalled by open demands for the immediate release of the defendants who admitted to their wrong doing by either pleading guilty to their criminal act or were convicted after trial by the court. Such demands, absurd and menacing as they are, are in blatant violation of international laws and basic principle of non-intervention. Baseless attacks on sentences imposed by the court, which properly and aptly exercises judicial power independently as guaranteed under the Basic Law, manifest a total disrespect to the rule of law. Statements that create a real risk of prejudice to court proceedings in that the public confidence in the due administration of justice is undermined may amount to contempt of court.",
            "The DoJ also reminds members of the public that no one should comment arbitrarily on cases in respect of which legal proceedings are still ongoing as the matter is sub judice.",

            "就海外政客關於區域法院今日（四月十六日）的判刑所作出的評論，律政司發表以下聲明：",
            "相關案件中的九名被告共同被控以「組織一個未經批准集結」和「明知而參與未經批准集結」的罪名，其中兩名被告在開審前承認控罪，餘下七人在四月一日被法庭裁定罪名成立。法官同日在判案書內說明定罪的理據，判案書亦已上載至司法機構的網站，給公眾查閱。法官在今日判刑時，亦在庭上公布判刑的原則。",
            "政府已多次指出，法院的職責，是在被告人認罪或經審訊定罪後，因應案情和犯人的情況，應用相關的原則，判處公正而合適的刑罰。任何一方如對法院判處的刑罰不滿，應以上訴或覆核的形式尋求糾正。",
            "對於有人公開要求立即釋放已認罪或經審訊定罪、承認所犯過失的被告，我們感到驚訝。這些要求荒誕無稽，明目張膽違反國際法及不干預的基本原則。法庭獨立及適當地進行審判受《基本法》保障，對法庭的判刑作出毫無事實基礎的攻擊，完全不尊重法治。任何行為如有確實風險會對法庭程序構成干擾，削弱公眾對妥善執行司法工作的信心，可能構成藐視法庭。",
            "律政司提醒社會各界，按迴避待決案件（sub judice）的法律原則，任何人都不應肆意評論司法程序尚在進行的案件。",
