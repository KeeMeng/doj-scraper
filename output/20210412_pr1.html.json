            "The \"Policies, Strategies and Opportunities\" webinar on opportunities for Hong Kong's legal industry under the 14th Five-Year Plan was held successfully this morning (April 12). The event was co-organised by the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Department of Justice, and supporting organisations included Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association Legal Affairs Steering Committee.",
            "The webinar was attended by guest speakers including Vice-Chairman of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Mr C Y Leung and Vice-Chairperson of the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Ms Maria Tam. The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, delivered the closing remarks for the event.",
            "Speakers enthusiastically shared their views and insights on topics including the measures for further promoting and stimulating Hong Kong's cross-boundary trade developments and the latest developments of Hong Kong's dispute resolution services under the 14th Five-Year Plan at the webinar. They also spoke on their experiences in contributing their expertise and career development on the Mainland.",
            "In her closing remarks, Ms Cheng pointed out that the 14th Five-Year Plan promotes Hong Kong's development in various key areas and supports Hong Kong in fully utilising its unique status and advantages. These measures will further highlight the importance of Hong Kong as an international dealmaking and legal and dispute resolution services centre. Different sectors of Hong Kong should grasp the opportunities and better integrate into national development by complementing the country's \"dual circulation\" development strategy.",
            "She said she believed that the 14th Five-Year Plan will bring more and better opportunities for the local legal and dispute resolution services sector, and further increase the demand for Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services from the Mainland and international communities.",
            "The full event will be available for review later at the Hong Kong Legal Hub's website.",

            "在研討會上，講者積極就「十四五」規劃下進一步促進及刺激香港跨境商貿發展的措施以及香港在爭議解決服務的最新發展等方面分享其看法及見解，亦講解他們到内地發展及貢獻其專業知識的經驗。",
            "鄭若驊在閉會辭中指出，「十四五」規劃在多個重要範疇促進香港的發展，支持香港繼續發揮其獨特地位和優勢。這些措施將更加突出香港作為國際交易促成樞紐和國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的重要性。香港各界應把握相關機遇，更好融入國家發展大局，積極配合國家雙循環發展格局。",
