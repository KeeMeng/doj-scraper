            "The \"2019 HCCH Judgments Convention: Global Enforcement of Civil and Commercial Judgments\" (the Conference), organised by the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) and the Department of Justice (DoJ), with the support from the Asian Academy of International Law, was successfully held in Hong Kong today (September 9).",
            "The HCCH is a leading global intergovernmental organisation in the field of private international law. It develops and services multilateral legal instruments on private international law to respond to global needs.",
            "Today's event is the inaugural global conference for the promotion of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (the Convention) which was concluded on July 2.",
            "The Conference was officially opened by the Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Jia Guide; the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC; and the Secretary General of the HCCH, Dr Christophe Bernasconi. More than 200 participants from 18 jurisdictions were addressed by 15 speakers who are practising and academic lawyers, judges and officials from Asia, Europe and Latin America and had participated or were involved in the negotiation of this ground-breaking new international convention.",
            "The Conference offered an international forum for the participants to exchange views on the Convention, which aims at enhancing legal certainty and predictability, and simplifies the recognition and enforcement of a judgment in other jurisdictions, ultimately facilitating the global circulation of judgments with less transaction and litigation costs as well as risks associated with cross-border dealings, and hence promoting effective access to justice. The origin, salient features and implications on cross-border trade and dispute resolution of the Convention were also discussed.",
            "The DoJ in recent years has been actively promoting Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region with a view to enhancing Hong Kong's position as a prime, global dispute resolution centre. To this end, the DoJ organises and supports trainings and capacity-building programmes relating to international law, judicial skills and dispute resolution for judges, government officials and members of the legal community in Asia and around the world from time to time. The Conference represented one of its efforts in such initiative.",

            "海牙會議是在國際私法領域具領導地位的全球性政府間國際組織，致力發展和提供多邊的國際私法法律文書，應付全球需要。",
            "今日舉辦的研討會是繼《承認與執行外國民商事判決公約》（《公約》）於七月二日締結後，為推廣《公約》而全球首次舉辦的國際研討會。",
            "研討會由外交部條約法律司司長賈桂德、律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師及海牙會議秘書長Christophe Bernasconi博士主持開幕儀式，共有來自十八個司法管轄區超過二百名人士參與。十五名講者包括執業和學術界律師、法官和政府官員，他們來自亞洲、歐洲和拉丁美洲等國家，並曾參與或涉及磋商這項突破性國際公約。",
            "研討會提供一個國際論壇讓與會者就《公約》交換意見，《公約》旨在提高法律保障和可預測性，以及簡化認可和執行其他司法管轄區的判決，達致判決全球流通，降低交易和訴訟成本，以及與跨境交易有關的風險，亦可促進司法公正。此外，研討會上亦有討論《公約》的起源、要點，以及對跨境貿易和爭端解決的影響。",
            "律政司近年一直積極推廣香港在亞太區的法律和爭議解決服務，以提升香港作為領先和國際爭議解決中心的地位。為此，律政司不時為亞洲及世界各地的法官、政府官員和法律界人士，舉辦和支援與國際法、司法技能和爭議解決有關的培訓和能力建設課程。是次研討會正顯示律政司在這方面的努力。",
