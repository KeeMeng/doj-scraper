            "In response to media enquiries, the Department of Justice (DoJ) issued the following statement today (January 20):",
            "The DoJ had instructed Mr David Perry, QC, to prosecute a trial involving offences of organising and knowingly taking part in an unauthorised assembly under the Public Order Ordinance. Mr Perry, QC, accepted the instruction and his ad hoc admission to the Hong Kong Bar was granted by the Chief Judge of the High Court on January 12, 2021.",
            "Since then, there have been growing pressure and criticism from the UK community directed at Mr Perry, QC, for his involvement in this case. Some of the ill-informed criticism conflated the matter with the National Security Law.",
            "Mr Perry, QC, expressed concerns about such pressures and the exemption of quarantine, and indicated that the trial should proceed without him.",
            "In light of the public interest involved and the imminent trial date, the DoJ has instructed another counsel to prosecute the trial as scheduled.",
            "As legal proceedings are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for anyone to comment on the case as it is a matter of sub judice. No one should embark upon baseless speculations. Any unfair and unfounded allegation made with a view to undermining and discrediting our independent criminal justice system will be vehemently refuted.",
            "Ends/Wednesday, January 20, 2021"

            "就傳媒查詢，律政司今日（一月二十日）發出以下聲明：",
            "律政司委聘David Perry御用大律師處理一宗涉及《公安條例》下組織及明知而參與未經批准集結案件的檢控工作。Perry御用大律師接受了律政司的委聘，並於二○二一年一月十二日獲高等法院首席法官准以「專案認許」方式為案件出庭。",
            "自此以後，有不斷來自英國社會的壓力和批評針對Perry御用大律師參與案件的工作。當中一些片面的批評將案件與國安法混為一談。",
            "Perry御用大律師對有關壓力及豁免強制檢疫的安排表示關注，並指出審訊在沒有他的情況下應如期進行。",
            "基於公眾利益及審訊日期臨近，律政司已委聘另一名律師如期處理案件的檢控工作。",
            "由於相關案件已進入司法程序，基於「迴避待決案件」的法律原則，任何人不應對案件作出評論，亦不應作出毫無根據的揣測。所有不公和失實的指控，以圖損害和詆譭我們獨立的刑事司法制度，律政司必定會強烈反駁。",
