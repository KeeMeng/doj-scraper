            "Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the opening ceremony of Prosecution Week 2014 today (June 23):",
            "Honourable LegCo representative Mr Dennis Kwok; President of the Law Society, Mr Ambrose Lam; Representative of the Bar Association, Mr Graham Harris, SC; colleagues from government departments and law enforcement agencies; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen:",
            "It gives me great pleasure to join you on this happy occasion to witness the official opening of Prosecution Week 2014.",
            "This event, known as \"Prosecution Week\", first started in 2012. I should take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Mr Justice Zervos, then our Director of Public Prosecutions and now a Judge of the Court of First Instance, as he is the one who came up with this idea and who contributed greatly to the success of the last two Prosecution Weeks held in 2012 and 2013.",
            "As two years have passed since the first Prosecution Week was held, this may be an appropriate occasion to revisit the rationale for organising this event and why we see fit to make it an important annual event in the calendar of the Department of Justice.",
            "The legal profession, the Government and the community as a whole place great importance in the rule of law. It has always been said, and rightly so, that the rule of law is one of the core values of Hong Kong and a value that we all want to steadfastly maintain. Whilst the rule of law has many different dimensions, there cannot be any doubt that the administration of criminal justice plays a vital role. Without a fair and robust criminal justice system, law and order cannot be maintained.",
            "It is obvious that the Department of Justice cannot single-handedly maintain an effective and fair criminal justice system. Instead, it has to work closely with the law enforcement agencies and other relevant stakeholders. The public, no doubt, is an important group of stakeholders in this context. As stated in the Introduction to our current Prosecution Code, \"The community has a vested interest in the proper conduct of its prosecutions and in furthering the criminal justice imperative that the guilty are convicted and the innocent are acquitted.\"",
            "It is equally obvious that we need to have public support and confidence before we can properly maintain our criminal justice system. In this context, public confidence and support mean that the public feel assured that our prosecutors are discharging their duties properly, fairly, independently and effectively. One, however, cannot possibly establish public support and confidence unless members of our community understand how the criminal justice system works, what are the roles of our public prosecutors, as well as the fundamental principles pursuant to which our prosecutors operate. With a view to enhancing public understanding, it is important to reach out to the community and to engage the public.",
            "For this reason, the Prosecutions Division has put special emphasis on enhancing the public's understanding of its work. The Director of Public Prosecutions mentioned just now in his speech the new initiative of the \"Meet the Community\" Programme. Under this programme, our prosecutors visit schools and community institutions to give talks so as to enhance the public's understanding of the criminal justice system and the rule of law. Besides, the Prosecution Code that I mentioned earlier was published in September last year. Not only does the Code provide detailed guidelines to prosecutors, it informs judges, defence lawyers, the accused, victims and the public of the principles we apply in making prosecution decisions as well as in dealing with other aspects of our prosecution works.",
            "Prosecution Week 2014 complements these new initiatives. It aims to promote the public's understanding and appreciation of the work of the Prosecutions Division through various activities in which the public can actively participate, including guided visits, mock courts and a slogan competition, the prize presentation for which will be held towards the later part of this ceremony. With growing community understanding of and support for the prosecution process, I believe our prosecution team can go from strength to strength in bringing the prosecution service even closer to the general public. In this way, it can respond more readily to the community's aspiration for the rule of law and better serve the public.",
            "The theme of this year's Prosecution Week is \"Prosecutions: Fearless, Accountable, Impartial and Robust\". The theme in Chinese is \"秉持公正，彰顯法治\", which means \"upholding justice and the rule of law\". These themes, though expressed in two different languages, complement each other. The message behind the English theme is that our prosecution service is devoted to conducting prosecution without fear or favour, thereby achieving the ultimate goal that the Chinese theme seeks to bring out, namely, to uphold justice and the rule of law.",
            "In this regard, Article 63 of the Basic Law entrenches the conduct of criminal prosecutions independently free from any interference. It is an important principle which we always adhere to when we discharge our duties. In particular, when faced with politically sensitive cases or cases which attract huge media interest, such as cases involving public figures or cases concerning public order events, it is all the more important to strictly adhere to this cardinal principle so that truly independent decisions are made, and that every step taken in the prosecution process is strictly in accordance with the law and the Prosecution Code.",
            "In carrying out this important constitutional duty, the efficient and dedicated prosecution team led by Mr Keith Yeung, SC, our current Director of Public Prosecutions, has spared no effort in handling the full array of criminal cases of different nature and significance. Although we are facing new challenges day after day, I have every confidence that Mr Keith Yeung, SC, and his team will continue to discharge their role properly and professionally in the way as highlighted in the themes of this year's Prosecution Week. I am also confident that with initiatives such as Prosecution Week, the general public will have an even better understanding of, and confidence in, our prosecution work.",
            "Last but not least, I wish to thank the Bar Association and the Law Society for the full and equally important support that they have rendered to Prosecution Week 2014. May I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all the colleagues of the Department of Justice, especially those in the Prosecutions Division, who assisted in making arrangements for this year's event. Without their hard work and dedication, the successful organisation of this meaningful event could have not been possible.",
            "With these remarks, I now formally declare the commencement of Prosecution Week 2014.",
            "Ends/Monday, Jun 23, 2014"

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月二十三日）出席檢控週2014揭幕儀式的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "立法會議員郭榮鏗先生、律師會會長林新強先生、大律師公會代表夏偉志資深大律師、政府部門和執法機構的同事、各位嘉賓、各位先生、女士：",
            "今日我很高興與各位一同見證二○一四年檢控週正式開幕。",
            "這項名為「檢控週」的活動，在二○一二年首次舉行。我想藉此機會，向時任刑事檢控專員、現任高等法院原訟法庭法官薛偉成資深大律師致意。檢控週由他構思，而這項活動上兩次在二○一二及二○一三年舉行時取得美滿成果，他功不可沒。",
            "自首屆檢控週舉行至今已有兩年，現在或許是適當時候，讓我們重新檢視舉辦這項活動的原因，以及我們為何認為適宜將此列為律政司每年的日程表中的重要活動。",
            "法律界、政府以至整個社會都非常重視法治。我們一直指法治為香港核心價值之一，這正確不過，而我們人人都渴望堅決維護這價值。儘管法治包含許多不同範疇，但刑事司法工作無疑擔當當中極其重要的角色。假如沒有公正健全的刑事司法制度，法律與秩序便無法維持。",
            "很明顯，要維持有效及公正的刑事司法制度，律政司不能孤軍作戰，而是須與執法機關及其他相關持份者緊密合作。毫無疑問，市民是當中重要的持份者。正如現行《檢控守則》的引言所述：「檢控工作是否執行妥當，刑事司法重責是否推展得宜，令罪有應得的人治罪，還無辜者清白，都是與公眾切身利益攸關。」",
            "同樣明顯的是，我們必須獲得公眾對我們的支持和信心，才能確保香港的刑事司法制度行之有效。在這方面，公眾信心和支持是指，公眾確信我們的檢控人員會以適當、公平、公正、獨立並有效的方式履行職務。然而，除非巿民明白刑事司法制度如何運作、檢控人員擔當甚麼角色，以及檢控人員依據甚麼基本原則行事，否則無法確立公眾的支持和信心。為增進公眾對這方面的了解，我們必須主動接觸公眾，並與他們保持溝通。",
            "因此，刑事檢控科特別重增進市民對刑事檢控工作的理解。刑事檢控專員在剛才的發言中已向大家介紹過「與公眾會面」的新計劃。在這項計劃下，律政司檢控人員會到學校及社區機構舉辦講座，以加深市民對刑事司法制度及法治的認識。此外，我剛才提及的《檢控守則》已在二○一三年九月公布。該守則不但為檢控人員提供詳盡指引，更讓法官、辯護律師、被告、受害者及市民知悉我們在作出檢控決定和處理其他方面的檢控工作時所採用的原則。",
            "是次二○一四年檢控週的活動，正好與這些新措施相配合，重透過舉行公眾可以有更多參與的不同活動，包括導賞參觀、模擬法庭，以及將會在本典禮儀式稍後時間進行頒獎的標語創作比賽等，讓公眾人士對刑事檢控科的工作有更多的了解、更深的體會。我相信，隨社會對刑事檢控程序加深認識，並在大家的支持下，我們的檢控團隊定會繼續努力，進一步拉近檢控機關與市民大眾的距離，以便可以更有效回應市民對法治精神的訴求及服務社會大眾。",
            "今年檢控週的英文主題是「Prosecutions: Fearless, Accountable, Impartial and Robust」，中文主題是「秉持公正，彰顯法治」。主題雖以兩種語言表達，卻互相呼應。英文主題的意思是，我們的團隊是無畏無懼、不偏不倚，全心全力地進行檢控工作，從而達致中文主題所提出的「秉持公正，彰顯法治」的最終目標。",
            "有鑑於此，《基本法》第六十三條保障了刑事檢控工作的獨立性，不受任何干涉。我們履行職務時，一直堅守這項重要原則，尤其是處理政治敏感案件或廣受傳媒關注的案件（例如涉及公眾人物或關乎公共秩序的案件），我們更要嚴守這項根本原則，從而真正獨立地作出決定，確保檢控過程中每一步都嚴格依據法律和《檢控守則》進行。",
            "為履行這項重要的憲制責任，由現任刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師所領導、盡忠職守和效率昭著的檢控團隊，盡心竭力處理不同類型、大大小小、林林總總的刑事案件。雖然每日新挑戰接踵而來，但我深信楊家雄資深大律師和他的團隊會一如既往，繼續妥善和專業地履行職務，正如今年檢控週主題所強調的信息一樣。我也深信，透過舉行檢控週這類活動，可讓公眾更清楚明白和更信任我們的檢控工作。",
            "最後，我謹多謝大律師公會和律師會對二○一四年檢控週鼎力支持，這對我們同樣重要。我也希望藉此機會向所有參與協助籌辦是次活動的律政司同事，特別是刑事檢控科的同事，表達謝意。這個饒富意義的項目能夠成功舉辦，實有賴他們努力不懈，全力以赴。",
            "我現在宣布二○一四年檢控週正式開展。",
