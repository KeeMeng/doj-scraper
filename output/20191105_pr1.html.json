            "In response to the media reports on the courts and prosecution process, the Department of Justice today (November 5) issued the following statement:",
            "Article 88 of the Basic Law provides that judges of the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of an independent commission. And according to the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission Ordinance, the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission consists of nine members, including the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal as Chairman and the Secretary for Justice as member. Seven other members appointed by the Chief Executive are two judges, one barrister, one solicitor and three persons not connected with the practice of law. The Chairman and no fewer than six other members may exercise and perform any of the functions, powers and duties of the Commission. A resolution of the Commission is not effective if there are more than two votes not in favour. In discharging their functions, members of the Commission must take an oath of office to declare that they will \"freely and without fear or favour, affection or ill-will\" give their advice to the Chief Executive.",
            "The Basic Law stipulates that the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. It also stipulates that members of the Judiciary shall be immune from legal action in the performance of their judicial functions. Judges and other members of the Judiciary are chosen on the basis of their judicial and professional qualities. They will only determine the merits of the case according to law even where a case has political, social or economic ramifications. The legal system in Hong Kong is transparent. Most of the courts proceedings are open to the public. Written judgments, which set out the reasoning of the courts in arriving at the decisions, will usually be uploaded onto the Judiciary's website for public inspection. Therefore, there is simply no need to speculate just what was behind a court's decision on any matter, much less assert that the members of the Judiciary might have taken into account factors extraneous to the law.",
            "As regards the handling of cases, when the investigation is completed, a prosecution would only be commenced if sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction is available. In some cases, if a plea can be taken on the first appearance at the magistrates' court and the defendant pleads guilty to the charge, the court will convict the defendant upon his own plea and sentence him in due course. If no plea is taken at the first appearance and is adjourned for further hearings (for example, for the relevant law enforcement agency to make further enquiries, or the defendant applies to adjourn the trial to view the prosecution bundle), the magistrate will deal with bail strictly in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap 221).",
            "The magistrate is required by law to grant bail to a defendant unless it appears to the magistrate that there are substantial grounds for believing that the defendant would fail to surrender to custody as the magistrate may appoint; commit an offence while on bail; or interfere with a witness or pervert or obstruct the course of justice. In deciding bail, the magistrate will consider the position and arguments of the prosecution and the defence, and all relevant materials placed before it by the parties. If bail is granted, conditions on bail can be imposed depending on the circumstances of the particular case to ensure the defendant returns to court and will not commit any offence while on bail. If dissatisfied with the magistrate's decision on bail, both the prosecution and the defendant can apply to the Court of First Instance of the High Court for review or variation. The Court of First Instance will likewise consider and decide such an application in accordance with the legal requirements under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance.",
            "The public has the right to express their views on court decisions and related matters within the boundary permitted by the law. However, when expressing views on court rulings, one must also respect the judicial independence. Our courts administer justice and make their judgments in accordance with the law and admissible evidence. Judgments also set out the reasons by which they come to the decisions. Some may not like the outcome but should not endanger the impartiality and selflessness of the Judiciary by expressing criticism arbitrarily or unfairly, nor should they arbitrarily attack members of the Judiciary. These acts will only undermine the rule of law in Hong Kong. Scandalising the court or the members of the Judiciary by published words or publication of any report which prejudices the fair trial of an on-going proceeding may constitute criminal contempt. Past cases show that contemnors can be sentenced to fines and imprisonment.",

            "回應近期關於法庭及檢控程序的報道，律政司今日（十一月五日）作出以下聲明：",
            "《基本法》第88條規定，香港特別行政區的法官，根據獨立委員會推薦，由行政長官任命。而根據《司法人員推薦委員會條例》，司法人員推薦委員會（委員會）由九人組成，包括終審法院首席法官為主席，律政司司長為成員，另外由行政長官委任另外七名成員，計有：兩名法官、大律師及律師各一名及三名與法律執業完全無關的業外人士。委員會須由主席連同不少於六名其他委員才可行使及執行委員會的任何職能、權力及職責。出席委員會會議的委員中，若有兩人反對，決議就不能生效。委員會委員在履行職能時必須作出聲明，本着不懼不偏、無袒無憎的精神，向行政長官提供意見。",
            "《基本法》訂明，香港特區法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉，亦指出司法人員履行審判職責的行為不受法律追究。法官和其他司法人員是根據其本人的司法和專業才能選用，即使審理的案件會在政治、社會或經濟方面帶來影響，他們亦只按照案情依據法律判案。香港的法律制度具透明度，大部分聆訊均開放予公眾旁聽，書面判決列出判決的理由，一般會上載司法機構的網站供市民查閱。因此社會不應無理猜度法庭作出判決的背後考慮，更不應批評司法人員可能考慮了與法律無關的因素。",
            "至於處理刑事案件方面，當執法機關完成調查後，律政司只會在有充分可被法庭接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪的情況下提出檢控。在某些案件，假若被告人首次在裁判法院提堂便可答辯並承認控罪，則會由法庭作出裁決及判刑。若案件未能在首度提堂時進行答辯而需押後聆訊（例如讓執法機關作進一步調查或辯方申請押後以閲覽控方文件），裁判官會嚴格依據香港法例第221章《刑事訴訟程序條例》的法律規定處理保釋申請。",
            "根據法律要求，裁判官必須批准被告人保釋：法律規定只有在裁判官覺得有實質理由相信被告人會棄保潛逃；在保釋期間犯罪；或干擾證人或破壞或妨礙司法公正等情況下，方可拒絕保釋。在考慮保釋申請時，裁判官亦會考慮控辯雙方的立場和論據以及呈堂的所有資料。若法庭決定批准保釋，可按案件情況定下保釋條件，以確保被告人日後依時出庭應訊和在保釋期間不觸犯法律。如控方或被告人不滿裁判官的保釋決定，均可向高等法院原訟法庭申請覆核或更改。原訟法庭同樣會依據《刑事訴訟程序條例》所載列的法律要求，考慮和決定有關申請。",
            "社會人士有權在法律容許的範圍內就法庭的裁決或相關事項發表意見，然而，就法庭裁決發表意見的同時，必須尊重司法獨立。法庭秉行公義，按法律及可接納的證據作出裁決，司法人員亦會陳述裁決的理據。或許有人會不滿意裁決的結果，但不應該任意或不公平地作出危害司法機關公正及無私行事的批評，亦不應該肆意抨擊司法人員，這些言行只會損害香港的法治。發布誹謗法庭或司法人員的言論或在審訊中發布影響公平審訊的報道等，均有可能觸犯藐視法庭罪，過往有案例顯示藐視法庭者可被判罰款或監禁。",
