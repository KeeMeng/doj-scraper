            "Following is a question by the Hon Chu Hoi-dick and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (January 16):",
            "Question:",
            "Earlier on, the Independent Commission Against Corruption completed an investigation into the case concerning Mr Leung Chun-ying, the Chief Executive of the last term, entering into an agreement with UGL Limited and receiving payments from the company during his term of office. The Department of Justice (DoJ) issued a statement last month, stating that after having carefully considered the investigation reports and relevant materials, it considered that there was insufficient evidence to institute prosecution against Mr Leung. Before making the decision, the DoJ had not sought legal advice from outside counsel, which was at variance with the practices previously adopted by the DoJ for handling the cases concerning the then or former senior public officers such as Mr Antony Leung, Mr Rafael Hui, Mr Franklin Lam, Mr Donald Tsang and Mr Timothy Tong. This has aroused criticisms from some members of the public. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) as the DoJ pointed out in the aforesaid statement that \"… Mr Leung's acts in negotiating the takeover with UGL were congruent with the interests of DTZ\", whether the facts based on which the DoJ arrived at such conclusion included DTZ's written advice stating that its interests had not been undermined;",
            "(2) as the DoJ pointed out in three statements it issued in 2012 and 2013 that if there were sensitivities with regard to a particular case, legal advice from outside counsel would be sought before making a prosecution decision, whether the incumbent Secretary for Justice (SJ) has revised such practice since she took office; if so, of the details and reasons for that; if not, why SJ, when responding to media enquiries, remarked that \"we shall not brief out any case unless it involves a member of the DoJ\"; and",
            "(3) given that \"the decision not to prosecute\" made by the DoJ has aroused criticisms and queries from some members of the public (including whether the decision was related to Mr Leung's position as a state leader), whether the DoJ will expeditiously seek legal advice from outside counsel and then review \"the decision not to prosecute\"?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that the Department of Justice (DoJ) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government \"shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference\".",
            "That Basic Law's guarantee of independence ensures that prosecutors within the Department may act independently without political or other improper or undue influence. As the head of the DoJ, I have a constitutional duty and responsibility to make decisions and supervise the conduct of criminal prosecutions.",
            "The Prosecution Code published by the DoJ elaborates on the independence and role of the prosecutor.",
            "Paragraph 1.1 stipulates that \"a prosecutor is required to act in the general public interest, but independently as a 'minister of justice'. In making decisions and exercising discretion, a prosecutor must act fairly and dispassionately on the basis of the law, the facts provable by the admissible evidence, other relevant information known to the prosecution and any applicable policy or guidelines.\"",
            "Paragraph 1.2 stipulates that \"a prosecutor must not be influenced by:",
            "(a) any investigatory, political, media, community or individual interest or representation;",
            "(d) the possible political effect on the government, any political party, any group or individual; and",
            "(e) possible media or public reaction to the decision.\"",
            "The legal discussions within the DoJ are always conducted with professionalism, without fear or favour, absolutely free from political or other irrelevant considerations, and the details of the discussions needs to be kept in confidence.",
            "Decisions to prosecute or not, as the case may be, must be based on an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and the law, and be in accordance with the Prosecution Code. The factors and the test to be considered in making a decision to prosecute are set out in Chapter 5 of the Prosecution Code. According to paragraphs 5.3 to 5.5 of the Prosecution Code, the prosecution must consider whether there is sufficient evidence to institute a prosecution, and the test is whether the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate a reasonable prospect of conviction; if there is sufficient evidence to initiate a prosecution, the prosecution will then consider whether it is in the public interest to do so.",
            "Concerning the case raised in the question, the DoJ issued a statement on December 12, 2018, stating that there was insufficient evidence to institute prosecution after careful consideration of the investigation reports and the relevant materials submitted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Similarly, the decision was made according to the above principle and free from the influence of the identity of the persons involved or political factors.",
            "(1) The question touches upon the details of the case. I cannot talk about the case. Also, considering that the case is now under judicial review proceedings, I shall not and cannot comment on or add anything regarding the details of such decision. I would like to emphasise that according to paragraph 23.4 of the Prosecution Code, there are circumstances (e.g. due to legal professional privilege or personal privacy concern etc.) in which the giving of reasons may be contrary to the public interest or otherwise inappropriate. Particular note should be taken of sub-paragraph (c), which stipulates that the giving of reasons \"may adversely affect the administration of justice (especially in the case of a decision not to prosecute where public discussion may amount to a public trial without the safeguards of the criminal justice process)\".",
            "(2) The briefing out of criminal cases has two parts, which are before prosecutorial decision is made and after prosecution. Regarding the former one, it is a norm of the DoJ to make prosecutorial decision by members of the DoJ. When a case involves member(s) of the DoJ, it is appropriate to brief out the case for legal advice. Further, depending on the need of the case, the DoJ, as it previously mentioned to this Council, may resort to briefing out when:",
            "(a) there is a need for expert assistance where the requisite skill is not available in the DoJ;",
            "(b) there is no suitable in-house counsel to appear in court for the HKSAR;",
            "(c) the size, complexity, quantum and length of a case so dictate;",
            "(d) it is deemed appropriate to obtain independent outside counsel's advice or services so as to address possible perception of bias or issues of conflict of interests;",
            "(e) there is a need for continuity and economy; and",
            "(f) there is a need for advice or proceedings involving members of the DoJ.",
            "The question refers to three statements issued by the DoJ in 2012 and 2013 regarding cases with sensitivities. According to our record, prosecutorial decisions were made in respect of two of the cases without seeking outside legal advice. It can therefore be seen that whether it is a case with sensitivity or not is never a guideline for mandatory briefing out.",
            "It is not a norm of the DoJ to brief out cases for legal advice. Over the past three years, the Prosecutions Division of the DoJ provided an average of over 13 000 items of legal advice per year. Save for those involving member(s) of the DoJ, the numbers of cases in respect of which outside legal advice had been obtained before making the prosecutorial decisions were 0, 1, and 0 respectively in 2018, 2017 and 2016. It is evident that the DoJ has made prosecutorial decisions without seeking outside legal advice in a great majority of cases.",
            "(3) The DoJ bases its prosecutorial decision entirely on evidence, the Prosecution Code as well as applicable laws. The prosecutorial decision has been made. If there is reason such as the law enforcement agency discovers new evidence and considers that it is necessary to seek the DoJ's legal advice again, we will handle the case.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "以下是今日（一月十六日）在立法會會議上朱凱廸議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "廉政公署早前完成調查上任行政長官梁振英先生與UGL Limited簽訂協議，並於在任期間收受該公司款項的案件。律政司於上月發表聲明，表示仔細考慮調查報告及相關資料後，認為沒有足夠證據對梁先生提出檢控。律政司作此決定前沒有尋求外間大律師的法律意見，有別於律政司過去處理關於梁錦松、許仕仁、林奮強、曾蔭權和湯顯明等時任或前任高層公職人員的案件的做法，引起部分市民非議。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）鑑於律政司在上述聲明指出，「……梁振英與UGL就有關UGL收購戴德梁行的談判亦符合戴德梁行的利益」，律政司達致該結論的事實基礎是否包括戴德梁行表明其利益沒有受損的書面意見；",
            "（二）鑑於律政司曾在三篇其於二○一二和二○一三年發出的聲明中指出，如案件性質敏感，會在作出檢控決定前尋求外間大律師的法律意見，現任律政司司長自上任以來，有否修改此做法；如有，詳情及原因為何；如否，為何司長回應記者提問時說「除非案件涉及律政司的同事，我們才會外判」；及",
            "（三）鑑於律政司的「不檢控決定」引起部分市民非議和質疑（包括該決定是否與梁先生的國家領導人身分有關），律政司會否盡快尋求外間大律師的法律意見，然後覆核「不檢控決定」？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "《基本法》第六十三條規定，香港特區政府律政司「主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」。",
            "這項獨立性受《基本法》保障，可確保律政司的檢控人員獨立行事，不受政治或其他不當或不必要的壓力左右。身為律政司的首長，我有憲制責任和職責就刑事檢控工作作出決定及監督該方面的工作。",
            "律政司頒布的《檢控守則》詳述了檢控人員的獨立性及角色。",
            "第1.1段說明「檢控人員行事須以廣大公眾的利益為依歸，但作為『秉行公義者』則獨立自主。在作出決定和行使酌情權時，檢控人員必須根據法律、可接納的證據所證明的事實、控方已知的其他相關資料，以及任何適用的政策或指引，公正理智地行事」。",
            "第1.2段說明「檢控人員不得受下列因素影響：",
            "（a）任何涉及調查、政治、傳媒、社群或個人的利益或陳述；",
            "（d）對政府、任何政黨、任何團體或個人在政治上可能帶來的影響；以及",
            "（e）傳媒或公眾對有關決定的可能反應。」",
            "律政司一貫堅守專業精神，不偏不倚、無畏無懼、一視同仁。進行法律討論時，絶對不會作政治或其他無關的考慮，討論內容必須保密。",
            "檢控與否的決定，必須就所得的證據和相關法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按照《檢控守則》行事。作出檢控決定時須考慮的因素及驗證標準，已詳列於《檢控守則》第5章。根據《檢控守則》第5.3至5.5段，控方須考慮是否有充分證據進行檢控，並以根據有關證據是否有合理機會達致定罪為驗證標準；如有充分證據進行檢控，控方繼而須考慮作出檢控是否符合公眾利益。",
            "就問題所述的個案，律政司已於二○一八年十二月十二日發出聲明，指出經仔細考慮廉政公署提交的調查報告及相關資料後，認為沒有足夠證據提出檢控。這項決定，同樣是按上述的原則作出，並沒受涉案人士的身分或政治因素影響。",
            "（一）問題涉及了案件的細節。我不能談論個別案件。同時，亦考慮到有關個案正進行司法覆核程序，我不可亦不能就該決定的細節作任何回應或補充。我想強調，根據《檢控守則》第23.4段，在某些情況下，給予理由可能有違公眾利益或並不適當，如因法律專業保密權和個人私隱問題等。須特別注意的是（c）項，即「給予理由可能會對司法工作造成不良影響（尤其是在決定不提出檢控時，案件備受公眾討論，可能構成公審，導致沒有刑事司法程序保障）」。",
            "（二）把刑事案件外判，分為作出檢控決定前和檢控後兩部分。就前者而言，律政司的一貫做法是由司內人員作出是否檢控的決定。當案件涉及司內人員，將案件外判尋求外間法律意見是合適的做法。此外，按案件的需要，正如律政司過往在立法會提及，一般而言，律政司可以在下述情況下將案件外判，（由於時間關係，我不會逐一讀出）：",
            "（a）案件需要專家協助，而司內並無所需技能；",
            "（b）司內並無合適的律師就案件代表香港特區出庭；",
            "（c）基於案件的大小、複雜程度、申索金額和所需時間而認為有需要把案件外判；",
            "（d）認為案件適宜尋求獨立外間大律師提供法律意見或服務，以免可能予人有偏袒的觀感或出現利益衝突的問題；",
            "（e）基於案件的連貫性和減低開支的需要；以及",
            "（f）案件涉及司內人員而需尋求法律意見或進行法律程序。",
            "問題提及律政司在二○一二年及二○一三年發出三篇有關案件性質敏感的聲明。根據記錄，其中有兩宗案件都是在沒有尋求外間法律意見的情況下作出相關的檢控決定，可見案件性質敏感與否，從來都不是硬性需要外判的指引。",
            "將案件外判尋求法律意見，並非律政司的慣常做法。在過去三年，律政司刑事檢控科每年平均提供逾13,000次法律指引，撇除涉及律政司人員的案件，在作出檢控決定前有尋求外間法律意見，在二○一八年、二○一七年及二○一六年分別是0宗、一宗及0宗。可見絕大部分的案件均是律政司在沒有尋求外間法律意見的情況下作出的檢控決定。",
            "（三）律政司的檢控決定，完全是依據證據、《檢控守則》和適用法律而作出。檢控決定已作出。如執法機構有原因如發現新證據，認為需要再向律政司尋求法律意見，我們會處理。",
            "多謝主席。",

            "檢控與否的決定，必須就所得的證據和相關法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按照《檢控守則》行事",
            "作出檢控決定時須考慮的因素及驗證標準，已詳列於《檢控守則》第5章",
            "根據《檢控守則》第5.3至5.5段，控方須考慮是否有充分證據進行檢控，並以根據有關證據是否有合理機會達致定罪為驗證標準；如有充分證據進行檢控，控方繼而須考慮作出檢控是否符合公眾利益",
            "就問題所述的個案，律政司已於二○一八年十二月十二日發出聲明，指出經仔細考慮廉政公署提交的調查報告及相關資料後，認為沒有足夠證據提出檢控",
            "這項決定，同樣是按上述的原則作出，並沒受涉案人士的身分或政治因素影響",
            "（一）問題涉及了案件的細節",
            "我不能談論個別案件",
            "同時，亦考慮到有關個案正進行司法覆核程序，我不可亦不能就該決定的細節作任何回應或補充",
            "我想強調，根據《檢控守則》第23.4段，在某些情況下，給予理由可能有違公眾利益或並不適當，如因法律專業保密權和個人私隱問題等",
            "須特別注意的是（c）項，即「給予理由可能會對司法工作造成不良影響（尤其是在決定不提出檢控時，案件備受公眾討論，可能構成公審，導致沒有刑事司法程序保障）」",
            "（二）把刑事案件外判，分為作出檢控決定前和檢控後兩部分",
            "就前者而言，律政司的一貫做法是由司內人員作出是否檢控的決定",
            "當案件涉及司內人員，將案件外判尋求外間法律意見是合適的做法",
            "此外，按案件的需要，正如律政司過往在立法會提及，一般而言，律政司可以在下述情況下將案件外判，（由於時間關係，我不會逐一讀出）：",
            "（a）案件需要專家協助，而司內並無所需技能；",
            "（b）司內並無合適的律師就案件代表香港特區出庭；",
            "（c）基於案件的大小、複雜程度、申索金額和所需時間而認為有需要把案件外判；",
            "（d）認為案件適宜尋求獨立外間大律師提供法律意見或服務，以免可能予人有偏袒的觀感或出現利益衝突的問題；",
            "（e）基於案件的連貫性和減低開支的需要；以及",
            "（f）案件涉及司內人員而需尋求法律意見或進行法律程序",
            "問題提及律政司在二○一二年及二○一三年發出三篇有關案件性質敏感的聲明",
            "根據記錄，其中有兩宗案件都是在沒有尋求外間法律意見的情況下作出相關的檢控決定，可見案件性質敏感與否，從來都不是硬性需要外判的指引",
            "將案件外判尋求法律意見，並非律政司的慣常做法",
            "在過去三年，律政司刑事檢控科每年平均提供逾13,000次法律指引，撇除涉及律政司人員的案件，在作出檢控決定前有尋求外間法律意見，在二○一八年、二○一七年及二○一六年分別是0宗、一宗及0宗",
            "可見絕大部分的案件均是律政司在沒有尋求外間法律意見的情況下作出的檢控決定",
            "（三）律政司的檢控決定，完全是依據證據、《檢控守則》和適用法律而作出",
            "檢控決定已作出",
            "如執法機構有原因如發現新證據，認為需要再向律政司尋求法律意見，我們會處理",
            "多謝主席",
