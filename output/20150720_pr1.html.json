            "Following is the translation of the speech by the Secretary for Justice (SJ), Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, on the administration of the Estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang at the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services of the Legislative Council today (July 20):",
            "Chairman and members of the Panel,",
            "I appreciate the Panel's interest in the administration of the charitable Mrs Nina Wang's Estate. I will make use of this opportunity to give this Panel a summary of the latest development.",
            "As the protector of charities, SJ, together with the relevant Department of Justice (DoJ) colleagues, have been paying close attention to matters relating to the administration of the Estate of the late Mrs. Nina Wang and the implementation of Mrs Wang's Will. At the same time, DoJ has been monitoring the administration of the Estate and keeping in close contact with the interim administrators appointed by the Court. We also assisted the Court in legal proceedings taken out by the interim administrators; and sought guidance from the Court on the interim administration of the Estate as and when required. We would continue to co-operate with the interim administrators, so as to protect interest of the Estate.",
            "On May 18, 2015, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) made the final determination on the proper construction of Mrs Wang's Will, namely, that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (the Foundation) would hold Mrs Wang's Estate as a trustee. According to the CFA judgment, a scheme should be prepared and submitted to the Court of First Instance for approval after consultation between the Foundation's Board of Governors and SJ as the guardian of the public interest. The scheme should, amongst others, set out the establishment of a supervisory \"managing organisation\" and the detailed working-out of arrangements for the Chinese prize mentioned in the Will.",
            "DoJ has been consulting the relevant persons and is working on the preparation of a draft scheme. DoJ has also been liaising with the Foundation and the interim administrators appointed by the Court on the detailed arrangements for the implementation of the Will.",
            "At the moment, the Estate continues to be administered and preserved by independent interim administrators appointed by the Court, who are all professional accountants. I and my DoJ colleagues will continue to closely monitor the interim administrators' work in managing and preserving the Estate, and take such follow-up actions as may be appropriate with a view to protecting and safeguarding the interest of the charity.",

            "多謝委員會就龔如心女士遺產的管理事宜所表達的關注。我希望藉此機會，簡介遺產管理的最新發展。",
            "作為慈善事務守護人，我與律政司的相關同事一直有密切關注龔女士遺產的管理及其遺囑的執行等事宜。律政司亦同時監察該筆遺產的管理狀況，並與法庭委任的臨時遺產管理人保持緊密合作。我們亦有協助法庭處理臨時遺產管理人在過程中提出的法律程序，並會在有需要時就該筆遺產的臨時遺產管理事宜向法庭尋求指示。我們會繼續與臨時遺產管理人合作，以保障該筆遺產的權益。",
            "在本年五月十八日，終審法院就龔女士遺囑的詮釋作出終局裁定，即華懋慈善基金有限公司是以受託人的身分持有龔女士的遺產。根據終審法院的判決，華懋慈善基金的董事會及律政司司長應就遺產管理計劃作出商討，並擬備計劃提交原訟法庭批核。其中，該計劃須列明「監管機構」的設立，及就該遺囑提及的中國獎金的詳細安排。",
            "律政司現正與相關人士商討並擬定計劃草案。律政司將繼續就執行該遺囑的詳細安排，與華懋慈善基金和臨時遺產管理人進行協商。",
            "現階段，龔女士的遺產繼續由法庭委任的專業會計師擔任獨立臨時遺產管理人作管理及保存。我與律政司的同事會繼續密切關注臨時遺產管理人就該筆遺產的管理和保存的工作，亦會在有需要時作出適當的跟進，以維護及保障相關慈善利益。",
