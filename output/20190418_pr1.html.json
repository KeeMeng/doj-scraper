Ms Cheng pointed out the advantages brought about by the signing of the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Dr Horvath and Dr Pitkowitz were of the view that the Arrangement is an important development which would strengthen Hong Kong as an international dispute resolution centre. This also echoed the comments expressed by the Executive Director of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration, Ms Lise Bosman, at the meeting with Ms Cheng in The Hague, the Netherlands, on Tuesday (April 16, The Hague time).",

Ms Cheng also outlined the importance of the Arrangement in the development of Hong Kong as an international arbitration centre. The UNCITRAL, established by the United Nations General Assembly, plays an important role in developing a legal framework for the facilitation of international trade and investment.",
