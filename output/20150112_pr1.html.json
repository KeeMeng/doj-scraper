            "Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2015 today (January 12):",
            "Chief Justice, members of the Judiciary, Chairman of the Bar Association, President of the Law Society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,",
            "On behalf of the Department of Justice, may I start off by extending our warmest welcome to all of you here, especially to our guests who travelled from other jurisdictions to attend this event.",
            "This occasion, though known as \"Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year\", is not just a ceremony. It provides an opportunity for the legal, and indeed the entire, community to reflect on matters concerning our legal system, administration of justice and the rule of law.",
            "The Rule of Law and Universal Suffrage",
            "The importance of the rule of law is universally accepted in modern civilised societies. It is a treasure of our community which each of us, irrespective of our position and role, should make every effort to protect and defend. In highlighting this point, I have no intention whatsoever to diminish the importance of other concepts such as democracy, universal suffrage or social justice. However, the pursuit of democracy, universal suffrage, social justice or any other noble cause cannot and should not be used as a justification to act in any way which would erode the rule of law.",
            "Unfortunately, the rule of law in Hong Kong is facing significant challenges. The recent \"Occupy Movement\", which involved large-scale as well as sporadic unlawful activities, brings about blatant challenges to the rule of law.",
            "Some people put forward civil disobedience or the pursuit of universal suffrage as justification for their unlawful conduct. Whilst I believe the overwhelming majority of our community would not dispute the importance of universal suffrage, one should reflect on this fundamental question: Can there be universal suffrage without the rule of law? I would, without doubt, say \"Not possible!\". The reason is obvious. The rule of law is the bedrock of democracy and universal suffrage.",
            "Any constitutional development, including development towards universal suffrage, has to be built on the relevant legal and constitutional basis. The constitution and documents of constitutional nature represent the supreme law of the jurisdiction concerned, and provide the ultimate legal anchor for any constitutional development. The rule of law dictates that all constitutional development must be consistent with, and not contrary to, the relevant constitutional regime. Once the model of universal suffrage and the relevant details are devised, they would have to be translated into clear law (which usually takes the form of electoral legislation). Every step in the electoral process should be conducted in accordance with the law, so that members of the community can have their electoral rights protected. Should there be any electoral disputes, there should be proper channels to facilitate the fair and effective adjudication by an independent judiciary.",
            "All these would not be possible unless the rule of law is well and alive. Constitutional development or universal suffrage without the rule of law is no different to a house without foundation. It is accordingly difficult to see how there can be any valid reason for resorting to unlawful means for the purpose of pursuing universal suffrage, especially when such unlawful means would prejudice other people's rights and disrupt social order. Any contrary contention would in effect allow people to disregard the law as and when they see fit, which is the antithesis of the rule of law.",
            "Some people in the community suggest that the concept of the rule of law has different levels, and that obeying the law is only the lowest level. As a matter of legal philosophy, such a view may provide an interesting topic for discussion. But the law remains the law, and is there to be obeyed. One also wonders how can one escalate oneself to the higher levels of the rule of law without even respecting the fundamentals.",
            "Although the \"Occupy Movement\" has in a sense come to an end (at least for the time being), my worries concerning challenges to the rule of law have not altogether disappeared. I note, with regret, that there remain people in the community advocating, or are considering to advocate, further unlawful activities in the near future. May I make use of this opportunity to appeal to those people to come back to the realm of the rule of law and rationality, and abandon any thought for instigating any unlawful conduct. Any further unlawful activities, especially massive ones, would only do further harm to our community both domestically and at the international level.",
            "Criminal Prosecution",
            "Another challenge concerns the question of how to appropriately deal with the people who were involved in the unlawful activities that took place during the \"Occupy Movement\".",
            "This question, I fully appreciate, is likely to attract huge differences of opinions. As far as the Department of Justice is concerned, our stance is clear and firm. We would, as always, adhere to the two-stage approach set out in the Prosecution Code. This means that no prosecution will be made unless: firstly, there is sufficient admissible evidence to demonstrate a reasonable prospect of conviction, and secondly, commencing prosecution will be in the public interest.",
            "By applying this approach, we can ensure that any prosecutorial decision is only made on the basis of the applicable law, the admissible evidence and the public interest. The corollary is that other considerations such as the suspects' social status, their political affiliations or political views would not be taken into account. The exclusion of these irrelevant considerations is of utmost importance, especially for the purpose of discharging our duty under Article 63 of the Basic Law, as well as maintaining public confidence in the criminal justice system and the rule of law generally.",
            "From time to time, persons charged with criminal offences (especially offences relating to public order events) asserted that they are victims of political retribution. By reason of the prosecution policy we adopt, such allegations are completely groundless, and are often made with a view to gaining political mileage. The Department of Justice would never allow prosecution to be used as a political instrument, still less as a means to achieve political revenge.",
            "In future, when persons charged with a criminal offence repeat this kind of allegations, I would invite you to consider two questions: Have these people been convicted by the court after due process? Can it be sensibly suggested that our independent Judiciary is not discharging their duty properly by confining to law and evidence when making judicial decisions? A rational analysis of these two questions will dispel any contention of political persecution. Further, if a person can escape prosecution simply because his or her political stance is upheld by certain sectors in the community as a noble cause, that would in effect mean that our prosecutors are being subject to the influence of political thoughts, and that such a situation would be wholly contrary to the rule of law.",
            "A proper understanding of how the criminal justice system operates is essential to maintaining public confidence in our rule of law. To guard against unnecessary misunderstandings, it is important that the community appreciates the difference between the approach adopted by the Department of Justice to decide whether prosecution should be made, the test adopted by the Police when effecting arrest, and also the test adopted by the court when deciding whether to convict a defendant after trial.",
            "Police officers are entitled to effect an arrest provided they have a genuine and reasonable suspicion that the person in question has committed a relevant offence. They are not required to consider matters, such as public interest, which would have to be considered by the Department of Justice. Due to such differences, the mere fact that an arrested person is not subsequently charged with any criminal offence does not necessarily mean that the Police have made a wrongful arrest; nor does it necessarily follow that the prosecutors have failed in their duty to commence prosecution.",
            "Judges, on the other hand, will only deliver a guilty verdict if the offence is proved beyond reasonable doubt, which is a threshold higher than that adopted by prosecutors. Accordingly, the mere acquittal of a defendant does not necessarily mean that the defendant should not have been arrested or charged in the first place.",
            "Arbitration and Mediation",
            "Moving on, if I may, to the Government's policy to promote Hong Kong as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region. This policy brings benefits not just to the legal profession, but to Hong Kong as a whole as it enhances Hong Kong's competitiveness and international image as an international financial and commercial centre. I am happy to report that considerable progress has been made during the past legal year.",
            "In the context of arbitration, we have set up the Advisory Committee on Promotion of Arbitration. This Advisory Committee, comprising representatives of the key stakeholders and eminent members of the arbitration community, will be responsible for overall co-ordination and strategic planning for the future development and promotion of Hong Kong's arbitration services. We are confident that this Advisory Committee will take the promotion of Hong Kong's arbitration services to a new height.",
            "In November last year, the China Maritime Arbitration Commission (CMAC), a leading maritime arbitration institution in the Mainland, set up an arbitration centre in Hong Kong, which is its first arbitration centre outside the Mainland. The presence of CMAC in Hong Kong will further strengthen our status as an arbitration centre, and consolidate Hong Kong's status as a shipping and logistics hub.",
            "Last week, the Central People's Government and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), an internationally renowned arbitration institution based in the Hague with a history of over a century, signed a Host Country Agreement on the conduct of dispute settlement proceedings in Hong Kong, whilst Hong Kong signed the related Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements with PCA. The arrangement set out in these two documents will facilitate PCA-administered dispute settlement proceedings to be conducted in Hong Kong. Not only will this arrangement enable us to attract more international investment arbitrations to be conducted in Hong Kong, it represents a vote of confidence on the legal system, legal infrastructure and the rule of law in Hong Kong.",
            "In the context of mediation, the Steering Committee on Mediation is making good progress in its work. Amongst others, the study on the need to introduce an apology legislation to facilitate settlement of disputes is entering its final stage. We anticipate we shall be in a position to issue a consultation document within this year.",
            "Looking ahead, we will continue with our efforts to promote the use of mediation as a means of dispute resolution, as well as to promote Hong Kong's mediation services to local and overseas end users. General mediation aside, we will be moving towards the promotion of sector-specific mediation. In addition to medical and building management disputes, one of the key focuses in the coming years will be the use of mediation as a means to resolve intellectual property disputes, and we will explore the use of evaluative mediation on top of facilitative mediation. With our expertise and experience in intellectual property, we believe this new direction will further enhance Hong Kong's status both as a regional dispute resolution centre and as an intellectual property trading hub in the region.",
            "Concluding Remarks",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is admittedly facing formidable challenges. However, we owe it to Hong Kong and to our future generations to resolutely maintain the rule of law, so as to provide a solid foundation for the pursuit of constitutional development, democracy, social justice and other worthy causes. With our strong fundamentals, our top quality judicial and legal personnel, and the joint efforts by all the relevant stakeholders, I have every confidence that our rule of law will remain robust and sustainable.",
            "On this note, may I wish all of you a happy and rewarding 2015.",
            "Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（一月十二日）在二○一五年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位司法機構人員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們:",
            "首先，我代表律政司歡迎各位嘉賓，特別是從其他司法管轄區遠道而來參加是次典禮的嘉賓。",
            "這活動雖名為「法律年度開啟典禮」，但它不單單是一個儀式，更為法律界，甚或整個社會，提供機會反思我們的法律制度、司法制度及法治等相關議題。",
            "法治的重要性備受現代文明社會所公認。法治是社會的瑰寶，我們每個人，不分崗位或角色，均有責任盡力維護及堅守法治。我強調這觀點，並不代表我企圖蔑視民主、普選及社會公義等理念。但追求民主、普選、社會公義或任何其他崇高的理念，並不能也不應該成為作出破壞法治行為的辯解。",
            "不幸地，香港的法治正面對重大挑戰。近期發生的「佔領行動」涉及大型及個別違法行為，對法治明顯帶來衝擊。",
            "若干人士以公民抗命或爭取普選作為違法行為的辯解。我相信絕大多數社會人士均不會否認普選的重要性，但我們也應反思一個根本問題：若然沒有法治，能否還有普選？在我而言，我會毫不猶豫地答：「不可能！」原因很清楚，法治是民主及普選的基石。",
            "任何政制發展，包括普選進程，均須建基於相關法律及憲制基礎。憲法及憲制性文件是有關司法管轄區的最高法律，亦為其政制發展提供終極法律依據。法治要求所有政制發展必須符合憲制，而不是與憲制互相衝突。普選模式及相關細節敲定後，必須轉化為清晰的法律（一般以選舉法例方式落實）。再者，選舉過程每一步的運作，必須以法律為依歸，從而確保社會人士的選舉權利得到保障。若出現任何選舉爭議，則應通過恰當渠道交由獨立司法機關公平、有效地裁決。",
            "若然沒有健全的法治，絕不可能落實上述體制。沒有法治，政改或普選將猶如欠缺地基的樓房。因此，確實難以理解，怎可能有正當理據支持以違法手段爭取普選，特別是該等違法行為會損害他人權利和破壞社會秩序。任何相反觀點等同容許個別人士隨意漠視法律，這與法治的意念背道而馳。",
            "有社會人士提出法治的概念有不同層次，而守法只是最低的層次。從法律哲學角度而言，該觀點可能提供有趣的討論議題。但法律始終是法律，理應遵守。更令人費解的是，若然法治概念中最基本守法的要求也不尊重，談何踏上法治的更高階梯。",
            "雖然「佔領行動」可說已暫時告一段落，但我對該行動挑戰法治的憂慮卻並未完全消弭。遺憾地，我留意到仍有社會人士鼓吹或正考慮鼓吹在不久將來展開新一輪的違法活動。容許我藉此機會向該等人士作出呼籲，希望他們能重回法治與理性之國度，屏棄發動違法行為的歪念。任何違法行為，尤其是大型違法行為，只會對香港社會在本地及國際層面造成更多損害。",
            "另一挑戰，是如何妥善處理在「佔領行動」期間涉嫌違法人士的刑責問題。",
            "我理解此問題很可能引發重大意見分歧。在律政司而言，我們的立場清晰而堅定。一如既往，我們將繼續採用《檢控守則》的相關指引。除非符合以下兩項條件，否則不會提出檢控：（1）有充分可被法院接納的證據，顯示有合理機會能證明相關罪行；及（2）基於公眾利益，必須進行檢控。",
            "採用這處理方式，能確保任何檢控決定只建基於適用法律、可被法院接納的證據及公眾利益。換言之，作出檢控決定時不會考慮例如疑犯的社會地位、其政治背景或政治立場等其他因素。排除該等因素有極其重要意義，特別是確保堅守《基本法》第63條的憲制責任，及維護公眾對刑事司法制度和法治的信任。",
            "被檢控人士（特別是被檢控涉及公眾秩序活動罪行的人士）不時辯稱他們是政治迫害的受害者。鑑於上文解述的檢控程序，此等指控絕無根據，往往只是個別人士的「政治抽水」手段。律政司絕不會容許檢控權成為政治工具，更遑論容認檢控工作變質為政治報復。",
            "若往後被檢控人士仍提出此類指控，我敬請各位理性地審視兩個問題：這些人士是否在經符合程序公義的審訊後被定罪？是否有任何證據顯示我們的獨立司法機關並沒有恰當地履行其職務，即只以法律和證據作為裁決的基礎？只要我們就這兩方面作理性分析，不難推翻政治檢控的謬論。再者，若涉嫌犯案人士單純因其政治理念受社會上的個別群體推崇而可避過檢控，則變相意味檢控人員受到政治影響，這情況與法治概念大相逕庭。",
            "要維持公眾對法治的信心，必須讓公眾明白刑事司法制度如何運作。為避免不必要的誤會，社會大眾應理解律政司作出檢控決定、警務人員進行拘捕和法院作刑事裁決時採用的不同準則。",
            "只要有真正和合理懷疑，警務人員便有權對相關涉案人士進行拘捕。警務人員不需考慮律政司應考慮的因素（例如公眾利益）。由於存在這分別，即使被捕人士最終不被檢控，並不必然代表警方錯誤進行拘捕，亦不必然意味檢控人員失職，應檢控而不作檢控。",
            "另一方面，法官只會在毫無合理疑點的情況下才會裁定被告人罪成。不存在合理疑點的要求，比律政司作檢控決定時適用的門檻更高。因此，即使個別被告人最終被判無罪，亦不一定代表拘捕或檢控過程出現問題。",
            "以下我希望轉談特區政府推動香港作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議中心的政策。這政策不但對法律界有利，更有助提升香港作為國際金融、商貿中心的競爭力和國際形象，從而為香港整體帶來裨益。我很高興可以向大家報告，這方面的工作在過去一個法律年度有相當進展。",
            "在仲裁方面，我們成立了仲裁推廣諮詢委員會，負責提升發展和推動香港仲裁服務的整體統籌及策略規劃工作，其成員包括相關持份者代表及仲裁界翹楚。我們深信，諮詢委員會將令推動香港仲裁服務的工作更上一層樓。",
            "去年十一月，內地著名海事仲裁機構中國海事仲裁委員會（海仲委）在香港成立仲裁中心，為其在內地以外首個仲裁中心。海仲委在港設立仲裁中心將進一步強化香港作為區域仲裁中心，並有助鞏固香港作為航運及物流樞紐的地位。",
            "上星期，中央人民政府與常設仲裁法院簽訂東道國協議。與此同時，香港與常設仲裁法院簽訂相關行政安排備忘錄。常設仲裁法院總部設在海牙，擁有超過一個世紀的歷史，是一所在國際上赫赫有名的仲裁機構。上述兩件文件中設定的安排，令常設法院負責管理的爭議解決程序得以在香港進行。該安排令香港更有能力吸引國際投資仲裁在香港進行，亦等同對香港的法律制度、法律配套設施和法治優勢投下信心一票。",
            "在調解方面，調解督導委員會的工作亦有良好進展。當中就應否訂立道歉法例的研究已進入最後階段。我們預計可在本年內發布相關諮詢文件。",
            "展望將來，我們將繼續推廣調解作為解決爭議的方式，並會致力向本地及海外用家推廣香港的調解服務。除繼續推動一般調解，我們亦會重點發展特定行業的調解。醫療和大廈管理爭議外，來年另一發展重點為知識產權爭議調解服務，並會探討同步推動以「評估式調解」及「促進式調解」處理知識產權爭議。鑑於香港在知識產權方面擁有豐富專業知識和經驗，我們相信這新發展方向對提升香港作為區內爭議解決中心和知識產權貿易樞紐也有裨益。",
            "女士們、先生們，香港現時確實面對艱巨挑戰。然而，我們有責任為香港及往後的世代堅守法治，令政制、民主、社會公義等重要體制能有穩固的根基作進一步發展。憑藉香港的穩健基礎、高質素的司法及法律人員，加上各相關持份者的同心協力，我深信香港的法治定能持續活力盎然。",
            "最後，我祝願各位有一個愉快和豐盛的二○一五年。",
            "多謝各位！",

            "This policy brings benefits not just to the legal profession, but to Hong Kong as a whole as it enhances Hong Kong's competitiveness and international image as an international financial and commercial centre",
            "I am happy to report that considerable progress has been made during the past legal year.",
            "In the context of arbitration, we have set up the Advisory Committee on Promotion of Arbitration",
            "This Advisory Committee, comprising representatives of the key stakeholders and eminent members of the arbitration community, will be responsible for overall co-ordination and strategic planning for the future development and promotion of Hong Kong's arbitration services",
            "We are confident that this Advisory Committee will take the promotion of Hong Kong's arbitration services to a new height.",
            "In November last year, the China Maritime Arbitration Commission (CMAC), a leading maritime arbitration institution in the Mainland, set up an arbitration centre in Hong Kong, which is its first arbitration centre outside the Mainland",
            "The presence of CMAC in Hong Kong will further strengthen our status as an arbitration centre, and consolidate Hong Kong's status as a shipping and logistics hub.",
            "Last week, the Central People's Government and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), an internationally renowned arbitration institution based in the Hague with a history of over a century, signed a Host Country Agreement on the conduct of dispute settlement proceedings in Hong Kong, whilst Hong Kong signed the related Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements with PCA",
            "The arrangement set out in these two documents will facilitate PCA-administered dispute settlement proceedings to be conducted in Hong Kong",
            "Not only will this arrangement enable us to attract more international investment arbitrations to be conducted in Hong Kong, it represents a vote of confidence on the legal system, legal infrastructure and the rule of law in Hong Kong.",
            "In the context of mediation, the Steering Committee on Mediation is making good progress in its work",
            "Amongst others, the study on the need to introduce an apology legislation to facilitate settlement of disputes is entering its final stage",
            "We anticipate we shall be in a position to issue a consultation document within this year.",
            "Looking ahead, we will continue with our efforts to promote the use of mediation as a means of dispute resolution, as well as to promote Hong Kong's mediation services to local and overseas end users",
            "General mediation aside, we will be moving towards the promotion of sector-specific mediation",
            "In addition to medical and building management disputes, one of the key focuses in the coming years will be the use of mediation as a means to resolve intellectual property disputes, and we will explore the use of evaluative mediation on top of facilitative mediation",
            "With our expertise and experience in intellectual property, we believe this new direction will further enhance Hong Kong's status both as a regional dispute resolution centre and as an intellectual property trading hub in the region.",
            "Concluding Remarks",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is admittedly facing formidable challenges",
            "However, we owe it to Hong Kong and to our future generations to resolutely maintain the rule of law, so as to provide a solid foundation for the pursuit of constitutional development, democracy, social justice and other worthy causes",
            "With our strong fundamentals, our top quality judicial and legal personnel, and the joint efforts by all the relevant stakeholders, I have every confidence that our rule of law will remain robust and sustainable.",
            "On this note, may I wish all of you a happy and rewarding 2015.",
            "Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（一月十二日）在二○一五年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位司法機構人員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們:",
            "首先，我代表律政司歡迎各位嘉賓，特別是從其他司法管轄區遠道而來參加是次典禮的嘉賓",
            "這活動雖名為「法律年度開啟典禮」，但它不單單是一個儀式，更為法律界，甚或整個社會，提供機會反思我們的法律制度、司法制度及法治等相關議題",
            "法治的重要性備受現代文明社會所公認",
            "法治是社會的瑰寶，我們每個人，不分崗位或角色，均有責任盡力維護及堅守法治",
            "我強調這觀點，並不代表我企圖蔑視民主、普選及社會公義等理念",
            "但追求民主、普選、社會公義或任何其他崇高的理念，並不能也不應該成為作出破壞法治行為的辯解",
            "不幸地，香港的法治正面對重大挑戰",
            "近期發生的「佔領行動」涉及大型及個別違法行為，對法治明顯帶來衝擊",
            "若干人士以公民抗命或爭取普選作為違法行為的辯解",
            "我相信絕大多數社會人士均不會否認普選的重要性，但我們也應反思一個根本問題：若然沒有法治，能否還有普選？在我而言，我會毫不猶豫地答：「不可能！」原因很清楚，法治是民主及普選的基石",
            "任何政制發展，包括普選進程，均須建基於相關法律及憲制基礎",
            "憲法及憲制性文件是有關司法管轄區的最高法律，亦為其政制發展提供終極法律依據",
            "法治要求所有政制發展必須符合憲制，而不是與憲制互相衝突",
            "普選模式及相關細節敲定後，必須轉化為清晰的法律（一般以選舉法例方式落實）",
            "再者，選舉過程每一步的運作，必須以法律為依歸，從而確保社會人士的選舉權利得到保障",
            "若出現任何選舉爭議，則應通過恰當渠道交由獨立司法機關公平、有效地裁決",
            "若然沒有健全的法治，絕不可能落實上述體制",
            "沒有法治，政改或普選將猶如欠缺地基的樓房",
            "因此，確實難以理解，怎可能有正當理據支持以違法手段爭取普選，特別是該等違法行為會損害他人權利和破壞社會秩序",
            "任何相反觀點等同容許個別人士隨意漠視法律，這與法治的意念背道而馳",
            "有社會人士提出法治的概念有不同層次，而守法只是最低的層次",
            "從法律哲學角度而言，該觀點可能提供有趣的討論議題",
            "但法律始終是法律，理應遵守",
            "更令人費解的是，若然法治概念中最基本守法的要求也不尊重，談何踏上法治的更高階梯",
            "雖然「佔領行動」可說已暫時告一段落，但我對該行動挑戰法治的憂慮卻並未完全消弭",
            "遺憾地，我留意到仍有社會人士鼓吹或正考慮鼓吹在不久將來展開新一輪的違法活動",
            "容許我藉此機會向該等人士作出呼籲，希望他們能重回法治與理性之國度，屏棄發動違法行為的歪念",
            "任何違法行為，尤其是大型違法行為，只會對香港社會在本地及國際層面造成更多損害",
            "另一挑戰，是如何妥善處理在「佔領行動」期間涉嫌違法人士的刑責問題",
            "我理解此問題很可能引發重大意見分歧",
            "在律政司而言，我們的立場清晰而堅定",
            "一如既往，我們將繼續採用《檢控守則》的相關指引",
            "除非符合以下兩項條件，否則不會提出檢控：（1）有充分可被法院接納的證據，顯示有合理機會能證明相關罪行；及（2）基於公眾利益，必須進行檢控",
            "採用這處理方式，能確保任何檢控決定只建基於適用法律、可被法院接納的證據及公眾利益",
            "換言之，作出檢控決定時不會考慮例如疑犯的社會地位、其政治背景或政治立場等其他因素",
            "排除該等因素有極其重要意義，特別是確保堅守《基本法》第63條的憲制責任，及維護公眾對刑事司法制度和法治的信任",
            "被檢控人士（特別是被檢控涉及公眾秩序活動罪行的人士）不時辯稱他們是政治迫害的受害者",
            "鑑於上文解述的檢控程序，此等指控絕無根據，往往只是個別人士的「政治抽水」手段",
            "律政司絕不會容許檢控權成為政治工具，更遑論容認檢控工作變質為政治報復",
            "若往後被檢控人士仍提出此類指控，我敬請各位理性地審視兩個問題：這些人士是否在經符合程序公義的審訊後被定罪？是否有任何證據顯示我們的獨立司法機關並沒有恰當地履行其職務，即只以法律和證據作為裁決的基礎？只要我們就這兩方面作理性分析，不難推翻政治檢控的謬論",
            "再者，若涉嫌犯案人士單純因其政治理念受社會上的個別群體推崇而可避過檢控，則變相意味檢控人員受到政治影響，這情況與法治概念大相逕庭",
            "要維持公眾對法治的信心，必須讓公眾明白刑事司法制度如何運作",
            "為避免不必要的誤會，社會大眾應理解律政司作出檢控決定、警務人員進行拘捕和法院作刑事裁決時採用的不同準則",
            "只要有真正和合理懷疑，警務人員便有權對相關涉案人士進行拘捕",
            "警務人員不需考慮律政司應考慮的因素（例如公眾利益）",
            "由於存在這分別，即使被捕人士最終不被檢控，並不必然代表警方錯誤進行拘捕，亦不必然意味檢控人員失職，應檢控而不作檢控",
            "另一方面，法官只會在毫無合理疑點的情況下才會裁定被告人罪成",
            "不存在合理疑點的要求，比律政司作檢控決定時適用的門檻更高",
            "因此，即使個別被告人最終被判無罪，亦不一定代表拘捕或檢控過程出現問題",
            "以下我希望轉談特區政府推動香港作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議中心的政策",
            "這政策不但對法律界有利，更有助提升香港作為國際金融、商貿中心的競爭力和國際形象，從而為香港整體帶來裨益",
            "我很高興可以向大家報告，這方面的工作在過去一個法律年度有相當進展",
            "在仲裁方面，我們成立了仲裁推廣諮詢委員會，負責提升發展和推動香港仲裁服務的整體統籌及策略規劃工作，其成員包括相關持份者代表及仲裁界翹楚",
            "我們深信，諮詢委員會將令推動香港仲裁服務的工作更上一層樓",
            "去年十一月，內地著名海事仲裁機構中國海事仲裁委員會（海仲委）在香港成立仲裁中心，為其在內地以外首個仲裁中心",
            "海仲委在港設立仲裁中心將進一步強化香港作為區域仲裁中心，並有助鞏固香港作為航運及物流樞紐的地位",
            "上星期，中央人民政府與常設仲裁法院簽訂東道國協議",
            "與此同時，香港與常設仲裁法院簽訂相關行政安排備忘錄",
            "常設仲裁法院總部設在海牙，擁有超過一個世紀的歷史，是一所在國際上赫赫有名的仲裁機構",
            "上述兩件文件中設定的安排，令常設法院負責管理的爭議解決程序得以在香港進行",
            "該安排令香港更有能力吸引國際投資仲裁在香港進行，亦等同對香港的法律制度、法律配套設施和法治優勢投下信心一票",
            "在調解方面，調解督導委員會的工作亦有良好進展",
            "當中就應否訂立道歉法例的研究已進入最後階段",
            "我們預計可在本年內發布相關諮詢文件",
            "展望將來，我們將繼續推廣調解作為解決爭議的方式，並會致力向本地及海外用家推廣香港的調解服務",
            "除繼續推動一般調解，我們亦會重點發展特定行業的調解",
            "醫療和大廈管理爭議外，來年另一發展重點為知識產權爭議調解服務，並會探討同步推動以「評估式調解」及「促進式調解」處理知識產權爭議",
            "鑑於香港在知識產權方面擁有豐富專業知識和經驗，我們相信這新發展方向對提升香港作為區內爭議解決中心和知識產權貿易樞紐也有裨益",
            "女士們、先生們，香港現時確實面對艱巨挑戰",
            "然而，我們有責任為香港及往後的世代堅守法治，令政制、民主、社會公義等重要體制能有穩固的根基作進一步發展",
            "憑藉香港的穩健基礎、高質素的司法及法律人員，加上各相關持份者的同心協力，我深信香港的法治定能持續活力盎然",
            "最後，我祝願各位有一個愉快和豐盛的二○一五年",
            "多謝各位！",
