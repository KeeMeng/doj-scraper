            "Secretary for Justice: As I was saying in Cantonese just now, Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, and therefore the suggestion that Hong Kong should be independent or a movement to that effect would not be consistent with the status of Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region, nor do I believe would it be consistent with the interests of Hong Kong. In so far as there are future actions or movements which advocate the independence of Hong Kong, the Government would of course be monitoring the situation very closely and should there be any illegal act, we would certainly take the appropriate enforcement action. And so far as the news which was reported in one of the press today, I personally have not heard about the thing. Thank you.",
