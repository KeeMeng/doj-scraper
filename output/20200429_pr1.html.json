            "Following is a question by the Hon Cheung Kwok-kwan and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (April 29):",
            "Question:",
            "It has been reported that in September 2019, a Public Prosecutor under the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice (DoJ) co-published with a barrister in private practice a law popularisation book, which teaches young readers how to \"keep away from legal traps and understand human right protection\". Some members of the legal sector have queried whether some parts of the book are overgeneralised. For instance, the explanation in the book on whether a person, who has been found in possession of a fruit knife when stopped and searched by a police officer on the street, will be charged with the offence of \"possession of offensive weapon in public place\" is oversimplified. They have also queried whether that Public Prosecutor's expounding in the book on the rights of arrestees constitutes serious conflict of interests or roles with his duties in the DoJ. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether staff members of the DoJ are currently required to submit applications to their supervisors and obtain approval prior to publishing books pertaining to the law or containing their personal views on the law; if so, of the application procedure, the criteria for vetting and approval and the rank(s) of the approving officer(s), as well as whether an applicant is required to submit, for vetting, parts of the book intended to be published; if so, of the percentage of the content required to be submitted;",
            "(2) of the current mechanism for dealing with the situation where the content of a book published by a staff member of the DoJ may have constituted a conflict of interests or roles with his work in the DoJ;",
            "(3) of the number of books pertaining to the law published by staff members of the DoJ in the past decade according to the DoJ's records; among those books, the respective numbers of those (i) approved for publication and (ii) published without the necessary approval; whether the DoJ has held responsible the relevant staff members in the latter case;",
            "(4) whether staff members of the DoJ who have, without the necessary approval, published books that give rise to conflict of interests or roles with their work will be punished; if so, of the penalties and the number of such incidents in the past decade; and",
            "(5) as the aforesaid Public Prosecutor had obtained approval from the Director of Public Prosecutions before publishing the book, of the reasons why the DoJ transferred the Public Prosecutor out of his current post subsequent to the publication of the aforesaid press report; whether the DoJ has learnt a lesson from that incident and will devise a new mechanism under which similar cases will be subject to more stringent vetting and approval procedure; if so, of the details; if not, whether and how the DoJ will follow up the matter?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "According to the Civil Service Code issued by the Civil Service Bureau (CSB), civil servants are required to uphold the core value of commitment to integrity and ensure that no actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest shall arise between their official duties and private interests. According to the relevant civil service regulation, no civil servant may, without approval, publish in his own name, communicate to unauthorised persons, or make private copies of, documents or information obtained in his official capacity. A civil servant is required to obtain prior consent before taking up any paid outside work. The above principles are applicable to civil servants of different grades and ranks including prosecutors of the Department of Justice (DoJ).",
            "The DoJ's prosecutors always abide by Article 63 of the Basic Law and shoulder the constitutional duty enshrined therein, and handle all prosecution work in a fair, impartial and highly transparent manner. When conducting prosecutions, the DoJ's prosecutors are required to act professionally in strict accordance with the law and the Prosecution Code (the Code).",
            "The Code sets out the role and duties of prosecutors. The DoJ's prosecutors have always discharged their prosecutorial responsibilities in accordance with the relevant principles and have at all times exercised the highest standards of integrity and care in maintaining proper administration of justice. As the DoJ's prosecutors, they must ensure that their duties are discharged in a professional and impartial manner without being affected by their personal views expressed. In relation to legal matters, the Government's counsel shall remain independent and impartial, especially when there is a likelihood of handling relevant cases in future.",
            "In relation to Hon Cheung Kwok-kwan's specific questions, the DoJ, after consulting the CSB, replies as follows:",
            "(1) and (2) Same as other civil servants, the DoJ's prosecutors must obtain prior consent of his Head of Department (i.e. the Director of Public Prosecutions) before engaging on his own account in outside work (including publication) for remuneration of any sort, or accepting paid employment of any sort outside of his normal working hours.",
            "When considering such applications, the Head of Department should take into account a number of factors, including whether the outside work proposed may (or appears to) conflict with the officer's duties as a Government servant, and whether the arrangement proposed might be a source of embarrassment to the Government. In approving the relevant applications, the Head of Department may impose conditions as he thinks fit, for example, the applicant's outside work would generally take place outside of normal working hours, and no Government's resources would be used.",
            "(3) and (4) Generally speaking, where there is any act, conduct or behaviour of an officer which contravenes the Civil Service Code or government regulations, his respective department will take appropriate follow-up actions in accordance with the established procedures. If there is evidence that a civil servant has misconducted himself upon investigation, the management will take appropriate disciplinary action, including imposing disciplinary punishment of verbal warning, written warning, reprimand, severe reprimand, reduction in rank, compulsory retirement and dismissal, etc. The above mechanism is applicable to all civil servants including the DoJ's prosecutors.",
            "Any officer who fails to comply with the regulations on outside work, such as undertaking outside work without his Head of Department's written consent, will be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the above mechanism.",
            "The case referred to in the question is now under the DoJ's investigation. As for other cases, according to our record, the DoJ in the past 10 years gave approvals to a total of 14 officers to undertake outside work related to legal publications. We are not aware of any non-compliance during the period.",
            "(5) The DoJ places much emphasis on the professional conduct of prosecutors. In the event of non-compliance by the DoJ's officer, the DoJ will duly follow up without tolerance.",
            "The DoJ attaches great importance to the matters arising from a prosecutor's publication which are being handled seriously in accordance with the established internal procedures.",
            "To avoid possible public perception as a result of the relevant prosecutor's publication that he may not be able to perform his official duties in an impartial manner, that officer would not handle cases involving public order events.",
            "As usual, the DoJ will handle each application for paid outside work prudently under the existing mechanism taking into account actual experience, and impose appropriate conditions as may be necessary to the approvals so as to ensure that the relevant outside work would not and would not appear to be in conflict of interest or role with the applicant's duties.",

            "（一）現時律政司的人員在出版屬法律範疇或包含個人法律觀點的書籍前，須否向上級申請並獲批准；若須，申請的手續、審批準則和審批人員的職級為何，以及申請人須否提交擬出版書籍的部分內容以供審閱；若然，須提交多少百分比的內容；",
            "（二）現時有何機制處理律政司人員出版的書籍內容可能與其在律政司的工作構成利益或角色衝突的情況；",

            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "根據公務員事務局制訂的《公務員守則》，公務員必須恪守廉潔守正的基本信念，確保公職與私人利益之間不會出現實際、觀感上或潛在利益衝突。根據相關公務員規例，公務員如未獲批准，不得用個人名義發表因公職而獲得的資料，或傳達給未獲授權的人士，或私下製備副本。公務員從事任何有薪的外間工作，均須事先申請批准。以上原則適用於所有不同職系及職級的公務員，包括律政司的檢控人員。",
            "律政司的檢控人員一直恪守《基本法》第六十三條，肩負起該條訂下的憲制責任，並以公平、公正和高透明度的方式處理所有檢控工作。律政司的檢控人員進行所有檢控工作時，均須嚴格按照法律和《檢控守則》下的相關指引專業地處理所有刑事案件。",
            "《檢控守則》闡述了檢控人員的角色及職務。律政司的檢控人員一直按照相關原則履行檢控職責，在任何時間皆秉持公正廉潔，謹慎從事，以最高標準來維持司法公義。作為檢控人員，他們須確保以個人身分所發表的意見，無礙他們以專業、不偏不倚的態度執行職務。就法律事宜而言，政府的律師應保持獨立及公正，尤其日後有機會處理相關的案件。",
            "就張國鈞議員的具體提問，律政司經諮詢公務員事務局後回覆如下：",
            "（一）及（二）與其他公務員一樣，律政司的檢控人員必須事先提出申請，並在獲得所屬部門首長（即刑事檢控專員）批准後，才可以個人名義擔任外間工作（包括出版書刊），賺取任何酬勞，或接受任何在正常工作時間以外擔任的受薪職位。",
            "在審核該等申請時，部門首長應考慮多項因素，包括有關人員擬擔任的外間工作是否會（或看來會）與該員本身的政府僱員職務有衝突，以及擬擔任的外間工作會否令政府感到尷尬。在批准相關申請時，部門首長可施加其認為合適的附帶條件，例如申請人的外間工作一般會在辦公時間以外進行以及不會使用政府資源等。",
            "（三）及（四）一般而言，公務員的行為、操守和表現如違反《公務員守則》或政府規例，其所屬部門會按既定程序採取適當的跟進行動。如在調查後當局認為有證據顯示有關公務員有不當行為，便會採取適當的紀律行動，包括口頭警告、書面警告、譴責、嚴厲譴責、降級、迫令退休或革職等紀律處分。所有公務員，包括律政司的檢控人員，亦受上述同一機制規限。",
            "公務員若違反有關外間工作的規例，例如未得所屬部門首長的書面許可而擔任外間工作，會按上述機制遭受紀律處分。",
            "律政司正調查問題所提及的個案。至於其他個案，根據紀錄，在過去十年，律政司共批准14位人員從事與出版屬法律範疇的書刊的外間工作，其間並不知悉有違規情況。",
            "（五）律政司一向非常注重檢控人員的專業操守。如果發現司內人員有違規行為，律政司必定會嚴肅跟進，絕對不會容忍。",
            "律政司十分重視有關檢控人員著作引起的相關事宜，並會按照內部既定程序嚴肅處理。",
            "為免外界有可能對相關檢控官因其著作而產生他未能不偏不倚地履行職務的觀感，因此有關人員不會處理涉及公眾秩序活動的案件。",
            "一如以往，律政司會根據實際經驗，在現行機制下審慎處理每宗有薪外間工作的申請，並按需要在批核過程中施加合適的附帶條件，以確保相關外間工作不會和看來不會與申請人本身的職務出現利益或角色衝突。",
