            "Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2018 today (January 8):",
            "Chief Justice, members of the Judiciary, Chairman of the Bar Association, President of the Law Society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,",
            "On behalf of the Department of Justice, may I extend our warmest welcome to all of you here, especially to our guests from other jurisdictions.",
            "In Hong Kong, the rule of law is the cornerstone of our legal system, which in turn is the cornerstone of our society. With this firmly in mind, I gratefully accepted the appointment as Secretary for Justice, with humility, courage and determination to serve without fear or favour.",
            "The rule of law manifests itself in a multitude of facets. Law exists in practice. However, it should not only be practised by the lawyers, the Judges and the Government. More importantly, the rule of law should be observed and respected by the community as a whole. It is through our daily lives and activities that we become testament to the existence of the rule of law. All of us jointly bear the responsibility to respect, promote and further the rule of law as a fundamental basis of our society.",
            "I would like to focus on three points today: the role of the Department of Justice (the Department) in advising the Government and the Chief Executive, the Department's duty to conduct criminal prosecutions free from interference, and the independence of the Judiciary.",
            "Advice to Government",
            "It is the Department's duty and responsibility to provide honest, independent and professional advice to the Government on the legality of its acts and its compliance with the laws. It is the Government's role to formulate policy for the good of the society as a whole. Some policies can be implemented within the existing legal framework, while others may necessitate new laws to be enacted.",
            "In formulating new laws, the Basic Law, being the constitutional document governing the implementation of the overarching \"one country, two systems\" policy, provides fundamental principles to be observed. Yet, the drafters of the Basic Law, including those some would agree to be great legal minds from common law traditions, could not have foreseen all specific situations that may arise in the future. The wisdom, one may say, of such drafting is in the inherent flexibility of the Basic Law to allow developments over time whilst preserving the fundamentals that must be observed. The Basic Law straddles two legal systems in a unitary state - it was promulgated by a civil law legislature to be applied in a common law jurisdiction. The Basic Law, like any other law, is open to different interpretations. This diversity is augmented by the differences in the approaches to the understanding and interpretation of laws by the two different legal traditions. Having said that, this difference, like any other legal issue, must be resolved through an appreciation of the ways in which conflict of laws rules and concepts in comparative law studies should be applied. Exchanges of views in good faith, and most importantly, mutual understanding of the reasons for the difference, inform an objective legal analysis. The pursuit of proper interpretation will no doubt challenge the greatest of legal minds. With a common goal to implement a particular policy, a legal solution can be achieved.",
            "Criminal Prosecution",
            "The second aspect relates to the prosecutorial function of the Department. Article 63 of the Basic Law guarantees that the Department of Justice shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference.",
            "Decisions to prosecute or not, as the case may be, must be based on an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and the law and be in accordance with the published Prosecution Code. Politics can have no role to play in such decisions. The legal discussions within the Department will be conducted free from politics, with professionalism and, importantly, in confidence. Some decisions are hard to make, but the Department is duty bound to make decisions that are legally correct and free from any interference, difficult or unpalatable though they may be.",
            "A cause, however noble and honourable, must be pursued in accordance with the law. There are avenues by which views can be expressed and mechanisms in place for changes to be introduced. These are the proper means by which a cause can be pursued legally and with dignity. As the Acting Chief Justice Chan said in HKSAR v Chow Nok Hang FACC 12/2012, and I quote, \"Resorting to violence or threat of violence or breach of peace in the exercise of this right will not advance one's cause.\" He continues, \"The means to achieve a legitimate end must not only be peaceful, it must also be lawful. Violent or unlawful means cannot justify an end however noble. It may also attract criminal liability.\"",
            "Judicial Independence",
            "This leads to the third point, an important element of the rule of law - dispute resolution. The importance of an independent Judiciary that provides an accessible adjudicative system ensuring equality before the law, and observing due process cannot be understated. As evidenced in the judgments that have been rendered, our courts administer justice in full accordance with the law and evidence before it. Judgments set out the reasons by which they come to the decisions. Some may not like the outcome but it does not mean that the independence of the Judiciary is in anyway compromised. We have a strong legal fraternity and a strong and independent Judiciary in which we all take pride. It is my duty to ensure that the independence of our Judiciary, as enshrined in the Basic Law, is respected and not arbitrarily attacked or criticised. I urge the community to take the same stance.",
            "Objective Survey",
            "Some suggest that the rule of law in Hong Kong is under threat. If it means that it is being tested, I have no qualms with such suggestions. But, with respect, I cannot agree with suggestions that our rule of law is in anyway compromised.",
            "Objective studies by international organisations support the existence of an independent Judiciary. In the Global Competitiveness Reports of the World Economic Forum, Hong Kong's judicial independence ranked first in Asia for the past three years. According to the Worldwide Governance Indicators Project of the World Bank, which provides trends over longer periods rather than year on year fluctuations only, Hong Kong's percentile ranking in rule of law has improved from 69.9 per cent in 1996 to 93.3 per cent in 2016 (Note 1) over 20 years, or a leap from a top 70 place to a top 15 place. These statistics suggest an upward trend, but we must not be complacent and must continue to strive to be better.",
            "Whilst we must continue to stand firm to guard and uphold the rule of law, we must also act responsibly and not utter arbitrary statements that underestimate our rule of law.",
            "Everyone has a right to express opinions. Educated and constructive criticisms and opinions drive positive development, but irresponsible and unprofessional utterances that are transparently baseless do not.",
            "Arbitration and Mediation",
            "I turn to look at Hong Kong's role in international arbitration. Arbitration resolves some of the most important commercial and investment disputes internationally with the arbitral awards enforceable practically universally. It plays an important role in promoting the rule of law at an international level.",
            "Hong Kong has a strong arbitration culture, mature arbitration practice and a sophisticated arbitration community, and we are well placed to further develop our strengths in this area. Whilst Hong Kong has been ranked the third most preferred seat of arbitration worldwide (Note 2), the competition is keen. Yet it is competition that inspires advancement. Hong Kong has clarified the arbitrability of intellectual property rights disputes by way of the Arbitration (Amendment) Ordinance 2017 effective as at 1 January 2018. Members of the legal community have also put their heads together with the information technology sector and are working to develop an online dispute resolution system that will provide an efficient, affordable and accessible platform for arbitration. This platform once completed will take Hong Kong to a new dimension in the provision of dispute resolution services.",
            "Mediation has the benefit of identifying the common goal, of focusing on the interests of those concerned in search for a solution that will be acceptable to them. In the Financial Dispute Resolution Centre, there was an over 80 per cent success rate in 2016 (Note 3) in mediating financial disputes between investors and the financial institutions. From statistics produced by the Judiciary, mediated cases brought before the Court of First Instance and the District Court have reached a settlement rate of around 65 per cent in recent years. The Mediation Ordinance and the Apology Ordinance provide a sound legal framework for mediation to be further developed. In the online platform that I mentioned, online mediation is to be developed so as to provide a comprehensive dispute resolution service.",
            "In support of our policy on promoting mediation, the West Kowloon Mediation Centre has been constructed and will come into operation soon. It is a unique development that is dedicated to Small Claims Tribunal cases suitable for mediation. It is envisaged that this will greatly enhance the use and understanding of mediation.",
            "International Law",
            "In October 2017, Hong Kong held the 2nd UNCITRAL (Note 4) Judicial Summit, during which views were exchanged amongst judges and practitioners from the Asia Pacific region. This is in line with one of the important principles of UNCITRAL, that of harmonisation of laws and practice in international commercial transactions. Harmonisation creates a level playing field and transparency, thereby promoting international trade and investments. We are actively discussing with UNCITRAL to make this a regular international event in Hong Kong.",
            "To reinforce the above policy initiative, we have taken up the role of a convenor in the work of the Friends of the Chair on Strengthening Economic and Legal Infrastructure under the APEC (Note 5) Economic Committee and will organise an APEC Workshop in March at the margins of the 2018 APEC First Senior Officials Meeting on the Use of Modern Technology for Dispute Resolution and Electronic Agreement Management. This APEC project, together with the online dispute resolution platform discussed above, creates a synergy that will advance our strengths in arbitration.",
            "With the support of the Department, the Hague Conference on Private International Law is going to hold a global conference in Hong Kong on 18 to 20 April this year to celebrate its 125th anniversary. The event will give us a privileged opportunity to hear from notable experts their views on what private international law may offer in the modern age with expanding global interactions, prompted by, for example, China's Belt and Road Initiative.",
            "Under the Legal Hub project, renovation works in the West Wing of the former Central Government Offices (now renamed Justice Place) and the former French Mission Building to provide space for the operation of international, regional and local law-related organisations are progressing well. The software, through capacity building, must be further developed in parallel in the wake of globalisation and the growth of the Belt and Road Initiative projects.",
            "The Chief Executive, in her Policy Address, stated that the Government will actively seek to conclude free trade agreements, investment promotion and protection agreements and comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreements with other economies to further the strengths of Hong Kong's position as an international trade, commercial and financial centre. The Hong Kong - ASEAN (Note 6) Free Trade Agreement was signed in November 2017.",
            "All these show the need for expertise and demand for practitioners in this area is steadily increasing. A number of the universities in Hong Kong and the Asian Academy of International Law have continuously provided training in topical areas for students, practitioners, Judges and government officials and will continue to provide a platform for research and international exchange of views.",
            "Mutual Legal Assistance with the Mainland",
            "Returning to home, we have completed a number of mutual legal assistance arrangements with the Mainland. They were introduced as a result of the developments in society. Arrangements entered into are implemented locally with the passage of enabling legislation.",
            "With increasing cross-border marriages, the Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Civil Judgments in Matrimonial and Family Cases was concluded in June 2017. To implement this Arrangement, the Department is currently preparing a bill.",
            "With a growing number of cross-border transactions, the Arrangement on Mutual Taking of Evidence in Civil and Commercial Matters was concluded in December 2016 and took effect on 1 March 2017. Requests for assistance have been processed enabling litigants to obtain evidence with enhanced efficiency.",
            "Other arrangements, such as the expansion of the scope of the arrangement for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil judgments implemented since 2008, will be pursued. These will protect the interests of Hong Kong's residents and businesses through a clear, accessible and efficient legal framework.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, it leaves me to thank Rimsky, my predecessor, for serving Hong Kong with such dedication, devotion and good temperament, leaving me a hard act to follow. I will strive and do my best to serve without fear or favour in discharging my duties.",
            "Thank you for your kind attention.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（一月八日）在二○一八年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位司法機構人員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、各位女士、各位先生：",
            "首先，謹代表律政司歡迎各位，特別是來自其他司法管轄區的嘉賓，蒞臨出席典禮。",
            "法律制度是香港社會的支柱，而法治則是法律制度賴以成功的基石。本人定必把這點銘記心中，基於此，本人欣然接受委任為律政司司長，並會心存謙卑、無畏無懼、不偏不倚地服務社會。",
            "實行法治見諸於眾多方面。法律是通過實踐而得以彰顯，但是不應該只由律師、法官和政府實踐。更重要的是，整個社會都應該遵守和尊重法治。我們的日常生活和一舉一動，都是法治的明證。我們各人須共同承擔責任，尊重、提倡和推動法治，作為本港社會的基礎。",
            "今天我會集中談及三個重點：律政司為政府和行政長官提供法律意見的角色、律政司履行刑事檢控職責時不受任何干涉，以及司法獨立。",
            "向政府提供意見",
            "律政司有職責就政府的作為是否合法及符合法例規定，向政府提供坦誠獨立的專業意見。政府的角色在於為整個社會的福祉制訂政策，部分政策可在現行的法律框架下實施，而有些或需透過日後訂立的新法例推行。",
            "《基本法》是實踐「一國兩制」這總體政策的憲制性文件，載有制訂新法例時必須遵守的基本原則。然而，《基本法》的草擬者，即使包括被有些人視為深諳普通法傳統的法律專家，均無法預料日後可能出現的種種具體情況。可以說，《基本法》擬就方式的智慧，在於其內在的靈活通變：既保留須予恪守的基本原則，又能與時並進。《基本法》是在我們的單一體制國家跨越兩個法律制度的法律，由行使大陸法的立法機關頒布，在實施普通法的司法管轄區內應用。正如其他法律，不同人對《基本法》可以有不同詮釋方法；而兩個法律制度傳統的差異，如何理解和詮釋法律的分別，更令有關差別擴大。儘管如此，這種分歧就像其他法律問題，必須正確了解衝突法規則和比較法研究的概念可如何應用，方可解決。大家須真誠交換意見，更重要的是互相理解意見分歧的原因，方能做到客觀分析法律問題。尋求對法律的正確詮釋，殊非易事，即使對法律界的頂尖人才也不無考驗；但只要同心同德，矢志落實政策，定能找到一個符合法律的解決方案。",
            "刑事檢控",
            "第二個範疇與律政司的檢控職能有關。《基本法》第六十三條保障律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉。",
            "檢控與否的決定，必須就所獲得的證據和相關法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按照已公布的《檢控守則》行事。在作出該等決定時，不得有任何政治考慮。律政司內一貫堅守專業精神，進行法律討論時，不作政治考慮，並且以保密尤為至要。有些決定不易作出，但不論如何艱巨，甚或不受歡迎，律政司亦責無旁貸，必須作出法律上正確的決定而不受任何干涉。",
            "任何人追求目標，不論目標有多高尚和值得尊崇，行事都必須遵守法律。公眾可透過不同途徑各抒己見，社會上也設有機制，藉以推行改變。這些都是既合法亦具莊嚴地追求目標的正確方法。 終審法院署理首席法官陳兆愷在香港特別行政區 訴 周諾恆（終院刑事上訴2012年第12號）一案中所說的話，現引述如下（原文為英文）：「任何人在行使這權利時使用暴力或威脅使用暴力，又或破壞社會安寧，均無助於推展其目標。」他繼續說：「要達到正當目標，採取的手段不但必須和平，更要合法。無論目標有多崇高，也不能成為使用暴力或非法手段的理由，而最終更可能招致刑事責任。」",
            "司法獨立",
            "第三個重點關乎法治的重要元素之一──爭議解決。司法獨立重要之處，在於提供各人都可以訴諸法院的審裁制度，確保法律面前人人平等，並且奉行程序公義，其重要性不可以低估。以往頒布的判決書已證明，法院秉行公義，全然以法律及可接納的證據為本，判詞亦闡述作出裁決的理據。或許有人不滿判決的結果，但這並不代表司法獨立受到蠶食。我們有強大的法律專業團體，司法機構穩健獨立，我們都以此為榮。我有責任確保《基本法》明訂的司法獨立受到尊重，不會遭任意攻擊或批評。我籲請社會各界秉持同一立場。 客觀研究",
            "有人認為香港的法治受到威脅。如果這些意見是指香港的法治受到考驗，我並不質疑。不過，對於有意見指我們的法治受到損害，恕我不敢苟同。",
            "由國際組織進行的各項客觀研究，均支持我們擁有獨立司法機構。在世界經濟論壇的《全球競爭力報告》中，香港的司法獨立情況在亞洲連續三年位列第一。世界銀行所進行的「世界管治指標」研究，不僅提供按年變動，更提供長期趨勢。根據該研究，香港在法治方面的百分值，由一九九六年的69.9%上升至二○一六年的93.3%（註一），在20年間由首70名之內躍升為首15名之內。這些統計數字顯示香港的法治水平持續提升，但我們千萬不能自滿，仍須努力改進，精益求精。",
            "我們一方面必須繼續堅決捍衞和維護法治，另一方面也要以負責任的態度行事，切勿任意發表貶低法治，並可能對其造成損害的武斷言論。",
            "人人都有表達意見的權利。有根據和具建設性的批評和意見，有助推動正向發展，但不負責任和明顯沒有事實基礎的不專業言論，對香港發展毫無助益。",
            "仲裁與調解",
            "我稍轉話題談談香港在國際仲裁方面擔當的角色。國際上一些重大的商業和投資爭議，均是透過仲裁解決，當中的仲裁裁決可在差不多全球各地強制執行。仲裁是在國際層面上推動法治的要素。",
            "香港擁有茁壯的仲裁文化、成熟的仲裁業務，以及豐富經驗的仲裁人才，我們已經具備優越條件，可進一步發展本港這方面的優勢。雖然香港名列全球第三最受歡迎的仲裁地（註二），但我們面對的競爭激烈。不過，有競爭方有進步。我們透過訂立《2017年仲裁（修訂）條例》，澄清知識產權爭議可藉仲裁解決，而該條例已在二○一八年一月一日正式生效。同時，法律界與資訊科技界集思共議，着手建立一套線上爭議解決系統，藉以提供高效，實惠又方便用家的仲裁平台。當這個平台完成之後，香港的爭議解決服務將更上一層樓。",
            "調解的好處在於可找出共同目標，以有關人士的利益為重點，尋求各方均可接納的解決方案。二○一六年，金融糾紛調解中心就投資者與金融機構之間的金融糾紛進行調解的成功率超過80%（註三）。此外，司法機構的統計數字顯示，近年提交原訟法庭及區域法院使用了調解服務的案件中，約有65%最終能達成協議。《調解條例》和《道歉條例》提供健全的法律框架，讓調解服務得以進一步發展。關於剛才提到的線上平台，亦將會加入線上調解功能，以提供全面的爭議解決服務。",
            "為配合政府推動調解服務的政策而建成的西九龍調解中心，即將投入服務。該調解中心，是專供適合利用調解方式處理的小額錢債審裁處案件使用的獨特設施，預計這對公眾使用和認識調解服務，大有裨益。",
            "國際法",
            "香港在二○一七年十月舉辦第二屆聯合國國際貿易法委員會（貿法會）（註四）司法高峯會，來自亞太區的的法官及律師在會上交換意見。這符合貿法會的重要原則之一，即協調國際商業法律及常規。協調可創造公平及透明的競爭環境，從而推動國際貿易和投資。我們正積極與貿法會商討，讓此項國際活動定期在香港舉行。",
            "為加強上述政策措施，我們在亞太經合組織經濟委員會轄下加強經濟和法律基建主席之友工作組的工作中擔任召集人，並會於今年三月在亞太經合組織舉行二○一八年第一次高官會議期間，舉辦有關在爭議解決及電子協議管理中使用現代科技的工作坊。此項亞太經合組織計劃與上文提及的線上爭議解決平台，可產生協同效應，加強本港在仲裁方面的優勢。",
            "在律政司大力支持下，海牙國際私法會議將在本年四月十八至二十日來港舉行全球會議，以慶祝成立125周年。我們可通過這特別機會，聽取著名專家分享，在當今現代因諸如中國的「一帶一路」倡議以致全球各地互動日益頻繁下，國際私法能有何貢獻。",
            "按「法律樞紐」計劃，政府為前中區政府合署西座（現稱律政中心）及前法國外方傳道會大樓進行翻新工程，以提供辦公室空間予國際、區域及本地法律相關組織使用，有關工程現時進展良好。在全球化及「一帶一路」倡議的項目增長下，我們也要在軟件方面同步邁進，着手人力培訓工作。",
            "行政長官在《施政報告》中表明，政府會積極尋求與其他經濟體簽訂自由貿易協定、促進和保護投資協定和全面性避免雙重課稅協定，以進一步強化香港作為國際貿易、商業和金融中心的角色。就此，香港在二○一七年十一月與東盟（註五）簽訂《自由貿易協定》。",
            "對這領域的專門知識和法律執業者的需求穩步增加。香港多所大學和亞洲國際法律研究院一直為學生、法律執業者、法官及政府官員提供實用的專題培訓，也會繼續提供研究和國際交流意見的平台。",
            "與內地提供相互法律協助",
            "談回香港方面，我們因應社會發展，與內地達成多項提供相互法律協助的安排。這些安排通過適當的賦權法例在本地實施。",
            "鑑於跨境婚姻日漸普遍，我們在二○一七年六月簽訂《相互認可和執行婚姻家庭民事案件判決的安排》。為實施安排，律政司現正擬備有關條例草案。",
            "隨着跨境交易日益增加，《就民商事案件相互委託提取證據的安排》已在二○一六年十二月簽訂，並在二○一七年三月一日實施。我們已着手處理所收到的協助委託，使訴訟人能更快捷取得證據。",
            "我們也會落實其他安排，例如擴闊自二○○八年起實施的相互認可和執行民事案件判決的安排的適用範圍。這些安排將提供明確、簡便和高效的法律框架，保障香港居民與商界的利益。",
            "結語",
            "最後，我謹向前任司長袁國強先生致意。他竭誠為香港服務，工作克盡厥職，為人敦厚隨和。要做到同樣成績殊不容易，我必無畏無懼，不偏不倚，竭力履行我的職責。",

            "Chief Justice, members of the Judiciary, Chairman of the Bar Association, President of the Law Society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,",
            "On behalf of the Department of Justice, may I extend our warmest welcome to all of you here, especially to our guests from other jurisdictions.",
            "In Hong Kong, the rule of law is the cornerstone of our legal system, which in turn is the cornerstone of our society",

            "Advice to Government",
            "It is the Department's duty and responsibility to provide honest, independent and professional advice to the Government on the legality of its acts and its compliance with the laws",
            "It is the Government's role to formulate policy for the good of the society as a whole",

            "The wisdom, one may say, of such drafting is in the inherent flexibility of the Basic Law to allow developments over time whilst preserving the fundamentals that must be observed",
            "The Basic Law straddles two legal systems in a unitary state - it was promulgated by a civil law legislature to be applied in a common law jurisdiction",
            "The Basic Law, like any other law, is open to different interpretations",
            "This diversity is augmented by the differences in the approaches to the understanding and interpretation of laws by the two different legal traditions",
            "Having said that, this difference, like any other legal issue, must be resolved through an appreciation of the ways in which conflict of laws rules and concepts in comparative law studies should be applied",
            "Exchanges of views in good faith, and most importantly, mutual understanding of the reasons for the difference, inform an objective legal analysis",
            "The pursuit of proper interpretation will no doubt challenge the greatest of legal minds",
            "With a common goal to implement a particular policy, a legal solution can be achieved.",
            "Criminal Prosecution",
            "The second aspect relates to the prosecutorial function of the Department",
            "Article 63 of the Basic Law guarantees that the Department of Justice shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference.",
            "Decisions to prosecute or not, as the case may be, must be based on an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and the law and be in accordance with the published Prosecution Code",
            "Politics can have no role to play in such decisions",
            "The legal discussions within the Department will be conducted free from politics, with professionalism and, importantly, in confidence",
            "Some decisions are hard to make, but the Department is duty bound to make decisions that are legally correct and free from any interference, difficult or unpalatable though they may be.",
            "A cause, however noble and honourable, must be pursued in accordance with the law",
            "There are avenues by which views can be expressed and mechanisms in place for changes to be introduced",
            "These are the proper means by which a cause can be pursued legally and with dignity",
            "As the Acting Chief Justice Chan said in HKSAR v Chow Nok Hang FACC 12/2012, and I quote, \"Resorting to violence or threat of violence or breach of peace in the exercise of this right will not advance one's cause.\" He continues, \"The means to achieve a legitimate end must not only be peaceful, it must also be lawful",
            "Violent or unlawful means cannot justify an end however noble",
            "It may also attract criminal liability.\"",
            "Judicial Independence",
            "This leads to the third point, an important element of the rule of law - dispute resolution",
            "The importance of an independent Judiciary that provides an accessible adjudicative system ensuring equality before the law, and observing due process cannot be understated",
            "As evidenced in the judgments that have been rendered, our courts administer justice in full accordance with the law and evidence before it",
            "Judgments set out the reasons by which they come to the decisions",
            "Some may not like the outcome but it does not mean that the independence of the Judiciary is in anyway compromised",
            "We have a strong legal fraternity and a strong and independent Judiciary in which we all take pride",
            "It is my duty to ensure that the independence of our Judiciary, as enshrined in the Basic Law, is respected and not arbitrarily attacked or criticised",
            "I urge the community to take the same stance.",
            "Objective Survey",
            "Some suggest that the rule of law in Hong Kong is under threat",
            "If it means that it is being tested, I have no qualms with such suggestions",
            "But, with respect, I cannot agree with suggestions that our rule of law is in anyway compromised.",
            "Objective studies by international organisations support the existence of an independent Judiciary",
            "In the Global Competitiveness Reports of the World Economic Forum, Hong Kong's judicial independence ranked first in Asia for the past three years",
            "According to the Worldwide Governance Indicators Project of the World Bank, which provides trends over longer periods rather than year on year fluctuations only, Hong Kong's percentile ranking in rule of law has improved from 69.9 per cent in 1996 to 93.3 per cent in 2016 (Note 1) over 20 years, or a leap from a top 70 place to a top 15 place",
            "These statistics suggest an upward trend, but we must not be complacent and must continue to strive to be better.",
            "Whilst we must continue to stand firm to guard and uphold the rule of law, we must also act responsibly and not utter arbitrary statements that underestimate our rule of law.",
            "Everyone has a right to express opinions",
            "Educated and constructive criticisms and opinions drive positive development, but irresponsible and unprofessional utterances that are transparently baseless do not.",
            "Arbitration and Mediation",
            "I turn to look at Hong Kong's role in international arbitration",
            "Arbitration resolves some of the most important commercial and investment disputes internationally with the arbitral awards enforceable practically universally",
            "It plays an important role in promoting the rule of law at an international level.",
            "Hong Kong has a strong arbitration culture, mature arbitration practice and a sophisticated arbitration community, and we are well placed to further develop our strengths in this area",
            "Whilst Hong Kong has been ranked the third most preferred seat of arbitration worldwide (Note 2), the competition is keen",
            "Yet it is competition that inspires advancement",
            "Hong Kong has clarified the arbitrability of intellectual property rights disputes by way of the Arbitration (Amendment) Ordinance 2017 effective as at 1 January 2018",
            "Members of the legal community have also put their heads together with the information technology sector and are working to develop an online dispute resolution system that will provide an efficient, affordable and accessible platform for arbitration",
            "This platform once completed will take Hong Kong to a new dimension in the provision of dispute resolution services.",
            "Mediation has the benefit of identifying the common goal, of focusing on the interests of those concerned in search for a solution that will be acceptable to them",
            "In the Financial Dispute Resolution Centre, there was an over 80 per cent success rate in 2016 (Note 3) in mediating financial disputes between investors and the financial institutions",
            "From statistics produced by the Judiciary, mediated cases brought before the Court of First Instance and the District Court have reached a settlement rate of around 65 per cent in recent years",
            "The Mediation Ordinance and the Apology Ordinance provide a sound legal framework for mediation to be further developed",
            "In the online platform that I mentioned, online mediation is to be developed so as to provide a comprehensive dispute resolution service.",
            "In support of our policy on promoting mediation, the West Kowloon Mediation Centre has been constructed and will come into operation soon",
            "It is a unique development that is dedicated to Small Claims Tribunal cases suitable for mediation",
            "It is envisaged that this will greatly enhance the use and understanding of mediation.",
            "International Law",
            "In October 2017, Hong Kong held the 2nd UNCITRAL (Note 4) Judicial Summit, during which views were exchanged amongst judges and practitioners from the Asia Pacific region",
            "This is in line with one of the important principles of UNCITRAL, that of harmonisation of laws and practice in international commercial transactions",
            "Harmonisation creates a level playing field and transparency, thereby promoting international trade and investments",
            "We are actively discussing with UNCITRAL to make this a regular international event in Hong Kong.",
            "To reinforce the above policy initiative, we have taken up the role of a convenor in the work of the Friends of the Chair on Strengthening Economic and Legal Infrastructure under the APEC (Note 5) Economic Committee and will organise an APEC Workshop in March at the margins of the 2018 APEC First Senior Officials Meeting on the Use of Modern Technology for Dispute Resolution and Electronic Agreement Management",
            "This APEC project, together with the online dispute resolution platform discussed above, creates a synergy that will advance our strengths in arbitration.",
            "With the support of the Department, the Hague Conference on Private International Law is going to hold a global conference in Hong Kong on 18 to 20 April this year to celebrate its 125th anniversary",
            "The event will give us a privileged opportunity to hear from notable experts their views on what private international law may offer in the modern age with expanding global interactions, prompted by, for example, China's Belt and Road Initiative.",
            "Under the Legal Hub project, renovation works in the West Wing of the former Central Government Offices (now renamed Justice Place) and the former French Mission Building to provide space for the operation of international, regional and local law-related organisations are progressing well",
            "The software, through capacity building, must be further developed in parallel in the wake of globalisation and the growth of the Belt and Road Initiative projects.",
            "The Chief Executive, in her Policy Address, stated that the Government will actively seek to conclude free trade agreements, investment promotion and protection agreements and comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreements with other economies to further the strengths of Hong Kong's position as an international trade, commercial and financial centre",
            "The Hong Kong - ASEAN (Note 6) Free Trade Agreement was signed in November 2017.",
            "All these show the need for expertise and demand for practitioners in this area is steadily increasing",
            "A number of the universities in Hong Kong and the Asian Academy of International Law have continuously provided training in topical areas for students, practitioners, Judges and government officials and will continue to provide a platform for research and international exchange of views.",
            "Mutual Legal Assistance with the Mainland",
            "Returning to home, we have completed a number of mutual legal assistance arrangements with the Mainland",
            "They were introduced as a result of the developments in society",
            "Arrangements entered into are implemented locally with the passage of enabling legislation.",
            "With increasing cross-border marriages, the Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Civil Judgments in Matrimonial and Family Cases was concluded in June 2017",
            "To implement this Arrangement, the Department is currently preparing a bill.",
            "With a growing number of cross-border transactions, the Arrangement on Mutual Taking of Evidence in Civil and Commercial Matters was concluded in December 2016 and took effect on 1 March 2017",
            "Requests for assistance have been processed enabling litigants to obtain evidence with enhanced efficiency.",
            "Other arrangements, such as the expansion of the scope of the arrangement for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil judgments implemented since 2008, will be pursued",
            "These will protect the interests of Hong Kong's residents and businesses through a clear, accessible and efficient legal framework.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, it leaves me to thank Rimsky, my predecessor, for serving Hong Kong with such dedication, devotion and good temperament, leaving me a hard act to follow",
            "I will strive and do my best to serve without fear or favour in discharging my duties.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（一月八日）在二○一八年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位司法機構人員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、各位女士、各位先生：",
            "首先，謹代表律政司歡迎各位，特別是來自其他司法管轄區的嘉賓，蒞臨出席典禮",
            "法律制度是香港社會的支柱，而法治則是法律制度賴以成功的基石",
            "本人定必把這點銘記心中，基於此，本人欣然接受委任為律政司司長，並會心存謙卑、無畏無懼、不偏不倚地服務社會",
            "實行法治見諸於眾多方面",
            "法律是通過實踐而得以彰顯，但是不應該只由律師、法官和政府實踐",
            "更重要的是，整個社會都應該遵守和尊重法治",
            "我們的日常生活和一舉一動，都是法治的明證",
            "我們各人須共同承擔責任，尊重、提倡和推動法治，作為本港社會的基礎",
            "今天我會集中談及三個重點：律政司為政府和行政長官提供法律意見的角色、律政司履行刑事檢控職責時不受任何干涉，以及司法獨立",
            "向政府提供意見",
            "律政司有職責就政府的作為是否合法及符合法例規定，向政府提供坦誠獨立的專業意見",
            "政府的角色在於為整個社會的福祉制訂政策，部分政策可在現行的法律框架下實施，而有些或需透過日後訂立的新法例推行",
            "《基本法》是實踐「一國兩制」這總體政策的憲制性文件，載有制訂新法例時必須遵守的基本原則",
            "然而，《基本法》的草擬者，即使包括被有些人視為深諳普通法傳統的法律專家，均無法預料日後可能出現的種種具體情況",
            "可以說，《基本法》擬就方式的智慧，在於其內在的靈活通變：既保留須予恪守的基本原則，又能與時並進",
            "《基本法》是在我們的單一體制國家跨越兩個法律制度的法律，由行使大陸法的立法機關頒布，在實施普通法的司法管轄區內應用",
            "正如其他法律，不同人對《基本法》可以有不同詮釋方法；而兩個法律制度傳統的差異，如何理解和詮釋法律的分別，更令有關差別擴大",
            "儘管如此，這種分歧就像其他法律問題，必須正確了解衝突法規則和比較法研究的概念可如何應用，方可解決",
            "大家須真誠交換意見，更重要的是互相理解意見分歧的原因，方能做到客觀分析法律問題",
            "尋求對法律的正確詮釋，殊非易事，即使對法律界的頂尖人才也不無考驗；但只要同心同德，矢志落實政策，定能找到一個符合法律的解決方案",
            "刑事檢控",
            "第二個範疇與律政司的檢控職能有關",
            "《基本法》第六十三條保障律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉",
            "檢控與否的決定，必須就所獲得的證據和相關法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按照已公布的《檢控守則》行事",
            "在作出該等決定時，不得有任何政治考慮",
            "律政司內一貫堅守專業精神，進行法律討論時，不作政治考慮，並且以保密尤為至要",
            "有些決定不易作出，但不論如何艱巨，甚或不受歡迎，律政司亦責無旁貸，必須作出法律上正確的決定而不受任何干涉",
            "任何人追求目標，不論目標有多高尚和值得尊崇，行事都必須遵守法律",
            "公眾可透過不同途徑各抒己見，社會上也設有機制，藉以推行改變",
            "這些都是既合法亦具莊嚴地追求目標的正確方法",
            "終審法院署理首席法官陳兆愷在香港特別行政區 訴 周諾恆（終院刑事上訴2012年第12號）一案中所說的話，現引述如下（原文為英文）：「任何人在行使這權利時使用暴力或威脅使用暴力，又或破壞社會安寧，均無助於推展其目標",
            "」他繼續說：「要達到正當目標，採取的手段不但必須和平，更要合法",
            "無論目標有多崇高，也不能成為使用暴力或非法手段的理由，而最終更可能招致刑事責任」",
            "司法獨立",
            "第三個重點關乎法治的重要元素之一──爭議解決",
            "司法獨立重要之處，在於提供各人都可以訴諸法院的審裁制度，確保法律面前人人平等，並且奉行程序公義，其重要性不可以低估",
            "以往頒布的判決書已證明，法院秉行公義，全然以法律及可接納的證據為本，判詞亦闡述作出裁決的理據",
            "或許有人不滿判決的結果，但這並不代表司法獨立受到蠶食",
            "我們有強大的法律專業團體，司法機構穩健獨立，我們都以此為榮",
            "我有責任確保《基本法》明訂的司法獨立受到尊重，不會遭任意攻擊或批評",
            "我籲請社會各界秉持同一立場",
            "客觀研究",
            "有人認為香港的法治受到威脅",
            "如果這些意見是指香港的法治受到考驗，我並不質疑",
            "不過，對於有意見指我們的法治受到損害，恕我不敢苟同",
            "由國際組織進行的各項客觀研究，均支持我們擁有獨立司法機構",
            "在世界經濟論壇的《全球競爭力報告》中，香港的司法獨立情況在亞洲連續三年位列第一",
            "世界銀行所進行的「世界管治指標」研究，不僅提供按年變動，更提供長期趨勢",
            "根據該研究，香港在法治方面的百分值，由一九九六年的69.9%上升至二○一六年的93.3%（註一），在20年間由首70名之內躍升為首15名之內",
            "這些統計數字顯示香港的法治水平持續提升，但我們千萬不能自滿，仍須努力改進，精益求精",
            "我們一方面必須繼續堅決捍衞和維護法治，另一方面也要以負責任的態度行事，切勿任意發表貶低法治，並可能對其造成損害的武斷言論",
            "人人都有表達意見的權利",
            "有根據和具建設性的批評和意見，有助推動正向發展，但不負責任和明顯沒有事實基礎的不專業言論，對香港發展毫無助益",
            "仲裁與調解",
            "我稍轉話題談談香港在國際仲裁方面擔當的角色",
            "國際上一些重大的商業和投資爭議，均是透過仲裁解決，當中的仲裁裁決可在差不多全球各地強制執行",
            "仲裁是在國際層面上推動法治的要素",
            "香港擁有茁壯的仲裁文化、成熟的仲裁業務，以及豐富經驗的仲裁人才，我們已經具備優越條件，可進一步發展本港這方面的優勢",
            "雖然香港名列全球第三最受歡迎的仲裁地（註二），但我們面對的競爭激烈",
            "不過，有競爭方有進步",
            "我們透過訂立《2017年仲裁（修訂）條例》，澄清知識產權爭議可藉仲裁解決，而該條例已在二○一八年一月一日正式生效",
            "同時，法律界與資訊科技界集思共議，着手建立一套線上爭議解決系統，藉以提供高效，實惠又方便用家的仲裁平台",
            "當這個平台完成之後，香港的爭議解決服務將更上一層樓",
            "調解的好處在於可找出共同目標，以有關人士的利益為重點，尋求各方均可接納的解決方案",
            "二○一六年，金融糾紛調解中心就投資者與金融機構之間的金融糾紛進行調解的成功率超過80%（註三）",
            "此外，司法機構的統計數字顯示，近年提交原訟法庭及區域法院使用了調解服務的案件中，約有65%最終能達成協議",
            "《調解條例》和《道歉條例》提供健全的法律框架，讓調解服務得以進一步發展",
            "關於剛才提到的線上平台，亦將會加入線上調解功能，以提供全面的爭議解決服務",
            "為配合政府推動調解服務的政策而建成的西九龍調解中心，即將投入服務",
            "該調解中心，是專供適合利用調解方式處理的小額錢債審裁處案件使用的獨特設施，預計這對公眾使用和認識調解服務，大有裨益",
            "國際法",
            "香港在二○一七年十月舉辦第二屆聯合國國際貿易法委員會（貿法會）（註四）司法高峯會，來自亞太區的的法官及律師在會上交換意見",
            "這符合貿法會的重要原則之一，即協調國際商業法律及常規",
            "協調可創造公平及透明的競爭環境，從而推動國際貿易和投資",
            "我們正積極與貿法會商討，讓此項國際活動定期在香港舉行",
            "為加強上述政策措施，我們在亞太經合組織經濟委員會轄下加強經濟和法律基建主席之友工作組的工作中擔任召集人，並會於今年三月在亞太經合組織舉行二○一八年第一次高官會議期間，舉辦有關在爭議解決及電子協議管理中使用現代科技的工作坊",
            "此項亞太經合組織計劃與上文提及的線上爭議解決平台，可產生協同效應，加強本港在仲裁方面的優勢",
            "在律政司大力支持下，海牙國際私法會議將在本年四月十八至二十日來港舉行全球會議，以慶祝成立125周年",
            "我們可通過這特別機會，聽取著名專家分享，在當今現代因諸如中國的「一帶一路」倡議以致全球各地互動日益頻繁下，國際私法能有何貢獻",
            "按「法律樞紐」計劃，政府為前中區政府合署西座（現稱律政中心）及前法國外方傳道會大樓進行翻新工程，以提供辦公室空間予國際、區域及本地法律相關組織使用，有關工程現時進展良好",
            "在全球化及「一帶一路」倡議的項目增長下，我們也要在軟件方面同步邁進，着手人力培訓工作",
            "行政長官在《施政報告》中表明，政府會積極尋求與其他經濟體簽訂自由貿易協定、促進和保護投資協定和全面性避免雙重課稅協定，以進一步強化香港作為國際貿易、商業和金融中心的角色",
            "就此，香港在二○一七年十一月與東盟（註五）簽訂《自由貿易協定》",
            "對這領域的專門知識和法律執業者的需求穩步增加",
            "香港多所大學和亞洲國際法律研究院一直為學生、法律執業者、法官及政府官員提供實用的專題培訓，也會繼續提供研究和國際交流意見的平台",
            "與內地提供相互法律協助",
            "談回香港方面，我們因應社會發展，與內地達成多項提供相互法律協助的安排",
            "這些安排通過適當的賦權法例在本地實施",
            "鑑於跨境婚姻日漸普遍，我們在二○一七年六月簽訂《相互認可和執行婚姻家庭民事案件判決的安排》",
            "為實施安排，律政司現正擬備有關條例草案",
            "隨着跨境交易日益增加，《就民商事案件相互委託提取證據的安排》已在二○一六年十二月簽訂，並在二○一七年三月一日實施",
            "我們已着手處理所收到的協助委託，使訴訟人能更快捷取得證據",
            "我們也會落實其他安排，例如擴闊自二○○八年起實施的相互認可和執行民事案件判決的安排的適用範圍",
            "這些安排將提供明確、簡便和高效的法律框架，保障香港居民與商界的利益",
            "結語",
            "最後，我謹向前任司長袁國強先生致意",
            "他竭誠為香港服務，工作克盡厥職，為人敦厚隨和",
            "要做到同樣成績殊不容易，我必無畏無懼，不偏不倚，竭力履行我的職責",
