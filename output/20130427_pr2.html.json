            "Legal and arbitration professionals in Hong Kong, with their rich experience in international commercial law and high level of professional expertise, could provide legal and dispute resolution services in various areas to help Mainland enterprises, including enterprises in Fujian and Xiamen, to expand their international market, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said in Xiamen today (April 27).",
            "Mr Yuen delivered an opening address at the Seminar on Hong Kong Legal and Arbitration Services held in Xiamen this morning. He said that Hong Kong has been a hub for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region for years. While working to enhance laws, regulations and legal services, Hong Kong also strives to attract suitable international legal organisations and arbitration institutions to set up offices in Hong Kong.",
            "\"Apart from the establishment of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in the 1980s, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce also set up a branch of its secretariat in Hong Kong in 2008, which is the very first secretariat office outside its headquarters in Paris.",
            "\"In September last year, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, which we know very well, also established its first arbitration centre outside the Mainland in Hong Kong. This has not only strengthened Hong Kong's leading position as a centre for arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region, but also reinforced Hong Kong's advantage in the handling of Mainland-related arbitration cases.",
            "\"Late last year, the world-renowned Hague Conference on Private International Law set up its Asia Pacific Regional Office in Hong Kong. This not only constitutes a vote of confidence in Hong Kong's position as a regional legal services centre, but also enables Hong Kong to play a greater role in the provision of services in the field of private international law,\" Mr Yuen said.",
            "Noting that Hong Kong's arbitral awards are already enforceable in over 140 jurisdictions under the New York Convention, Mr Yuen said that the Department of Justice will continue to expand this network so that the arbitral awards made in Hong Kong could be enforced in more places.",
            "Mr Yuen hoped that today's seminar would deepen the co-operation in legal and arbitration services between Fujian and Hong Kong and to provide a useful platform for further exchanges. He expressed his gratitude to all participating organisations, including the Department of Justice of Fujian Province, Xiamen Municipal Bureau of Justice and various public institutions, arbitration bodies and legal bodies, for their support.",
            "The seminar, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, the People's Government of Fujian Province and the Xiamen Municipal Government, carries the theme \"Going-out\" - legal issues, risk management and dispute resolution. The seminar mainly aims to promote Hong Kong's important role as a legal services and dispute resolution centre in the Asia Pacific Region, and the services and assistance provided by Hong Kong's legal and arbitration professions to Mainland enterprises in their process of \"going-out\".",
            "The seminar was attended by more than 400 legal and arbitration professionals, government officials and business sectors in both Fujian Province and Hong Kong, including the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Law Society of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission Hong Kong Arbitration Centre and the Asia Office of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce.",
            "The seminar is one of the activities under the Fujian Xiamen Hong Kong Week 2013, which aims to enhance and deepen the co-operation between Fujian Province and Hong Kong in trade and economics, professional services, culture and creative industries.",
            "Mr Yuen met with the Director-General of the Department of Justice of Fujian Province, Mr Chen Yixing, this morning and exchanged views on the development of legal and arbitration services and further enhancement of legal co-operation and liaison in both places. He also visited the Hong Kong exhibitions of Fujian Xiamen Hong Kong Week 2013.",

            "袁國強今早出席在廈門舉行的「香港法律及仲裁服務研討會」，他在致開幕辭時指出，香港多年來是亞太區域的法律和解決爭議服務中心。在完善法律、法規和法律服務之外，香港同時積極吸引合適的國際法律和仲裁機構在香港設立辦事處。",
            "他說：「除了在一九八○年代設立的『香港國際仲裁中心』外，『國際商會』的『國際仲裁院』於二○○八年在香港設立秘書處分處，成為其巴黎總部以外設立的第一個秘書處分處。」",
            "「另外，『中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會』也在去年九月在香港設立首個內地以外的仲裁中心。貿仲委香港仲裁中心的成立，不單鞏固香港作為亞太區仲裁中心的領導地位，也進一步強化香港處理涉及內地的仲裁個案的優勢。」",
            "「去年年底，國際知名的『海牙國際私法會議』在香港設立亞太區域辦事處。這不單代表『海牙會議』對香港作為亞太區法律服務中心投下信心的一票，也令香港能夠在提供國際私法服務方面發揮更大的作用。」",
            "袁國強表示，在香港作出的仲裁裁決，現在已可根據《紐約公約》在超過140個司法管轄區強制執行。律政司還在繼續拓展這個網絡，務求香港仲裁裁決能在更多地方得到有效執行。",
            "袁國強希望今日的研討會可以深化福建和香港法律仲裁界的交流合作，建立良好的平台。他感謝所有參與和支持這次研討會的機構，包括福建省司法廳、廈門市司法局以及多個部委、機關、仲裁委員會和律師協會。",
            "今日的研討會由香港特別行政區政府聯同福建省及廈門市人民政府主辦，以「企業『走出去』的法律問題、風險管理和爭議解決」為主題，主要目的是推廣香港作為亞太區法律及解決爭議中心的重要角色，以及香港法律及仲裁專業在內地企業「走出去」的過程中能夠提供的服務和協助。",
            "四百多名福建及香港兩地的法律和仲裁界專業人士、政府官員及商界代表出席了今日的研討會。當中香港的代表包括香港大律師公會、香港律師會、香港國際仲裁中心、中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會香港仲裁中心及國際商會國際仲裁院亞洲事務辦公室的代表。",
            "「香港法律及仲裁服務研討會」是「2013福建廈門香港周」的其中一項活動。目的是擴大和深化香港特區和福建省的經貿、專業服務、文化和創意各方面的合作。",
            "袁國強今早與福建省司法廳廳長陳義興會面，就法律及仲裁服務在兩地的發展及進一步加強兩地的法律合作及聯繫交換意見。他在下午亦參觀了「2013福建廈門香港周」的香港展館。",
