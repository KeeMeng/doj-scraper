            "In response to the comments from local and overseas communities concerning the sentences of three defendants who pleaded guilty to charges in the case WKCC2289/2020, the Department of Justice today (December 2) made the following statement:",
            "The legal proceedings of the case have not yet completed. The DoJ will not comment on it at this stage. Suffice it to note that the magistrate in the Reasons for Sentence stated, \"since this case involves disruption of public order and safety as well as threatening the personal safety of members of the public, in order to protect public interest and safeguard the life and property of citizens… I believe that penalties with deterrence are necessary\".",
            "Human rights and freedom in Hong Kong, including freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, are fully protected by the Basic Law. However, such freedoms are not absolute. As the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2020 stated that, \"we see clear limits in the law to the exercise of rights. The enjoyment or insistence on one's rights does not, for example, provide any excuse to harm other people or their property, or to display acts of violence.\"",
            "The three defendants pleaded guilty to their charges. Those who absurdly demanded for their immediate release not only disrespect our judicial system but also manifest their blatant denial of the fact that the defendants themselves pleaded guilty.",
            "The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is committed to upholding the rule of law. Articles 63 and 85 of the Basic Law stipulate respectively that the DoJ \"shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference\", and the courts of the HKSAR \"shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference\".",
            "It is unbecoming and irrational for people making sweeping attacks and baseless accusations against our judicial and legal systems without reference to the fact and circumstances of the case. Such statements, if made with a view to exert undue influence on our judicial and legal systems will be futile.",

            "就本地及國際社會因應三名已承認案件WKCC2289/2020控罪的被告的判刑所作出的評論，律政司今日（十二月二日）發表以下聲明：",
            "由於案件的司法程序尚未完成，律政司現階段不會就此評論。裁判官已於判刑理由指出：「由於本案涉及破壞公共秩序及安全，對公眾人士的人身安全造成威脅，為了保障公眾利益和市民的生命財產……本席認為需判處具阻嚇性的刑罰」。",
            "香港的人權和自由，包括言論自由和集會自由，受到《基本法》的充分保障。然而，該等自由並非絕對。正如終審法院首席法官在二○二○年法律年度開啟典禮中指出：「法律對權利的行使有明確限制。享用或堅持個人權利，舉例說，不能成為損害他人人身安全或財產，或使用暴力的藉口。」",
            "該三名被告已承認控罪。那些提出荒謬要求要立即釋放被告的人，非但不尊重香港的司法制度，更顯示出他們罔顧三人已然認罪的事實。",
            "香港特別行政區政府致力維護法治。《基本法》第六十三條及第八十五條分別訂明律政司「主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」，香港特別行政區法院則「獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉」。",
            "對我們的司法和法律制度作出以偏概全的攻擊及毫無根據的指責，完全漠視案件的事實和情況，既不恰當也不理智。若企圖藉此等言論對我們的司法和法律制度施加不當影響，只會徒勞無功。",
