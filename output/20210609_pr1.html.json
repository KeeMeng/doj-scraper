            "Following is a question by Dr the Hon Cheng Chung-tai and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (June 9):",
            "Question:",
            "It has been reported that there has been an upsurge of staff departure in the Department of Justice (DoJ) recently. Regarding the manpower and expenditure of the DoJ, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the number of the DoJ's officers of the Government Counsel grade who departed in each quarter since January 2014, with a breakdown by reason of departure as well as their rank and title upon departure; whether the DoJ has assessed the causes for the upsurge of staff departure; and",
            "(2) whether the expenditure of the National Security Prosecutions Division under the DoJ is appropriated from the $8 billion special fund dedicated to meeting the expenditure for safeguarding national security; if so, of the amount involved and the uses of the various items of the estimated expenditure; if not, the head from which the Division's expenditure is appropriated as well as the uses and amounts of the various subheads?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Article 99 of the Basic Law stipulates that public servants must be dedicated to their duties and be responsible to the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Civil servants, being a key component of the public service, have a constitutional role to give their best in serving the Chief Executive and the Government of the day. According to the Civil Service Code issued by the Civil Service Bureau (CSB), civil servants are required to uphold the core values of commitment to the rule of law, honesty and integrity, objectivity and impartiality, political neutrality, dedication, professionalism and diligence, and to ensure that no actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest shall arise between their official duties and private interests. Moreover, civil servants shall at all times ensure that their behaviour would not impede their performance of official duties in a fair and professional manner. The above principles are equally applicable to Government Counsel (GC) Grade members at the Department of Justice (DoJ).",
            "The DoJ plays a key role in the legal system of Hong Kong and maintaining the rule of law. In recent years, the HKSAR Government has to cope with ever-increasing challenges, and particularly in the past two years after restoration of order and stability, and as a result of the impact brought by the pandemic. The challenges faced by the DoJ in its legal work are also unprecedented.",
            "For instance, the DoJ's prosecution work may sometimes attract extensive discussions in the community. Whilst members of the public have the right to express their views on related matters within the boundary permitted by the law, some overseas and local persons have maliciously attacked the DoJ's prosecution work repeatedly with unfair and unfounded allegations. On civil work, following the social unrest in 2019, the DoJ handles a substantial number of related judicial reviews, including those relating to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, the Police operation. On the other hand, in light of the rise in acts during social unrest involving online dissemination of information to incite violence and doxxing activities towards judges and law enforcement officers, the Secretary for Justice, as the guardian of public interest, successfully applied for four court injunctions to restrain acts that jeopardise people's lives, safety and property, and deter or harass the public from enjoying their common rights.",
            "As the head of department, I entirely appreciate that colleagues at the DoJ, on top of heavy daily workload, also have to bear the unnecessary outside pressure. Amid such challenges, I and the DoJ as a team have all along discharging our duties with the highest professional standards, impartiality and without fear or favour. These duties include controlling criminal prosecutions free from any interference in accordance with Article 63 of the Basic Law; providing independent and professional legal advice to the Government; and drafting legislation.",
            "In relation to Dr the Hon Cheng Chung-tai's questions, I now reply as follows:",
            "(1) Natural staff wastage is commonplace in any organisation, and the Government is no exception. It is inappropriate to describe such normal personnel turnover as what so-called \"an upsurge of staff departure\". According to the statistics from the CSB, in 2020-21, the wastage in the civil service was around 4.8 per cent of the strength. Retirement was the primary reason for departure of civil servants, and the other reasons include resignation, completion of agreement and death. In the past few years, the annual numbers of departing DoJ civil servants were about the same, being comparable to the wastage rate of the civil service at large. Departure of GC Grade members in the DoJ (including retirement and resignation) is indeed normal personnel turnover and most importantly, the DoJ's operation remains unaffected. The society should take this in stride.",
            "The DoJ has been monitoring the manpower situation within the department. A vacancy, as it arises, will be filled as appropriate under the succession arrangement to ensure the normal operation of the department. I believe that colleagues now at the DoJ are all sharing a common goal: to serve Hong Kong, to advance the rule of law and access to justice, thereby achieving \"Rule of Law and Justice for All\".",
            "Moreover, the DoJ will continue to provide professional training for our counsel with a view to broadening their horizons and enhancing their skills in different areas of work. We will also give due recognition to colleagues with outstanding performance and strive to gain them the same from the sector.",
            "(2) As pointed out in the HKSAR Government's statement of February 25 this year, the funding arrangement for the expenditure for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR is made in strict accordance with the relevant requirements in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR (National Security Law). According to Article 19 of the National Security Law, the Financial Secretary of the HKSAR shall, upon approval of the Chief Executive, appropriate from the general revenue a special fund to meet the expenditure for safeguarding national security and approve the establishment of relevant posts, which are not subject to any restrictions in the relevant provisions of the laws in force in the HKSAR. The Financial Secretary shall submit an annual report on the control and management of the fund for this purpose to the Legislative Council of the HKSAR (LegCo). To this end, the Financial Secretary has made a provision of $8 billion to meet the expenditure for safeguarding national security in the next few years and will submit a report to the LegCo in due course.",

            "以下是今日（六月九日）在立法會會議上鄭松泰議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的答覆：",

            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "《基本法》第九十九條訂明，公務人員必須盡忠職守，對香港特別行政區政府負責。公務員作為公職人員體制中的主要組成部分，具有政制上的角色，須竭盡所能，輔助在任的行政長官及政府。根據公務員事務局制訂的《公務員守則》，公務員須恪守的基本信念，包括堅守法治、誠實可信、廉潔守正、不偏不倚、政治中立、盡忠職守以及專業勤奮，當中須確保公職與私人利益之間不會出現實際、觀感上或潛在利益衝突。另外，公務員必須時刻確保他們的行為不會妨礙他們以專業及公正的態度執行職務。以上原則同樣適用於律政司政府律師職系的人員。",
            "律政司在香港的法律制度和維護法治方面擔當重要角色。近年，特區政府需應對的挑戰與日俱增，尤其經歷了過去兩年由亂及治和疫情帶來的衝擊，律政司在法律方面的工作亦面臨前所未有的挑戰。",
            "舉例來說，律政司的刑事檢控工作，有時或會引起社會上廣泛討論。雖然社會人士有權在法律容許的範圍內就相關事項發表意見，但有些海外及本地人士屢屢對律政司的檢控工作作出不公和毫無事實根據的指控，以惡意抨擊律政司的檢控工作。民事工作方面，經歷了二○一九年的社會動盪，律政司要處理大量相關的司法覆核，包括涉及《緊急情況規例條例》、警察行動等事宜。另外有見社會動盪期間於網上發布煽動暴力的言論以及針對法官和執法人員等的「起底」行為越趨嚴重，律政司司長當時亦以公眾利益守護者身分成功申請了四個禁制令，禁制危害市民生命、安全財物及妨礙或滋擾公眾享有他們共有權利的行為。",
            "作為部門首長，我十分理解律政司同事除需應付日常繁重的工作量外，更要承受一些不必要的外界壓力。儘管面對此等挑戰，我與整個律政司團隊一直致力以最高的專業水平、公正和無畏無私的精神履行職務，包括按《基本法》第六十三條確保主管刑事檢控工作不受任何干涉；為政府提供獨立專業的法律意見；擬備法例等。",
            "就鄭松泰議員的提問，我現回覆如下：",
            "（一）任何機構均會有員工自然流失的情況，政府也不例外，硬將這些一般的人事更替描述成甚麼所謂「離職潮」並不恰當。根據公務員事務局的統計數字，在二○二○年至二一年度，公務員流失人數佔實際員額約百分之四點八。退休是公務員離任的主要原因，其他原因包括辭職、約滿離職和去世。過去數年，律政司每年公務員離職人員的人數水平相若，與整體公務員流失率亦相若。律政司內政府律師職系人員的離任（包括退休、辭職等）屬一般的人事更替，最重要的是並不影響律政司的運作，社會應以平常心看待。",
            "律政司一直有留意司內人手情況。每當有空缺出現，本司會有適當的人事接任安排去填補，確保部門正常運作。我相信現時在律政司的同事，都應該是懷着同一目標，為香港服務、促進法治和司法公義，達至「法治公義普惠共享」。",
            "此外，律政司會繼續致力為司內律師提供專業培訓，以擴闊他們的視野及提升他們於不同範疇的工作技能，讓表現傑出的同事獲得肯定，並為他們爭取司法及法律界的認同。",
            "（二）正如特區政府於今年二月二十五日的聲明中指出，有關特區維護國家安全開支的撥款安排是嚴格按照《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》（《香港國安法》）的相關規定進行。根據《香港國安法》第十九條，經行政長官批准，財政司司長應當從政府一般收入中撥出專門款項支付關於維護國家安全的開支並核准所涉及的人員編制，不受香港特別行政區現行有關法律規定的限制。財政司司長須每年就該款項的控制和管理向立法會提交報告。就此，財政司司長已作出80億元的撥款，用以支付關於維護國家安全未來數年的開支，稍後亦會向立法會提交報告。",
