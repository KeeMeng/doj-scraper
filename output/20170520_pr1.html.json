            "Jointly organised by the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice, the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong, the conference provides a platform for various stakeholders in the criminal justice system to exchange views on the future development of Hong Kong's criminal justice system.",
            "Today's conference covered four major topics, namely active case management; protection to the vulnerable in court; joint enterprise law in Hong Kong; and development of sentencing practice.",
            "Addressing at the opening ceremony of the conference, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said that the criminal justice system is one of the most important aspects of our legal system, underpinning the rule of law in Hong Kong.",
            "He said, \"On the part of the Department of Justice and as stressed in our Prosecution Code, we always endeavour to put in place a robust criminal justice system that is transparent and fair, as well as one that strikes the right balance between the protection of human rights and the need to protect the public from criminal activities.\"",
            "Mr Yuen added, \"To achieve this aim, substantial law as well as procedural measures to ensure a fair trial are of utmost importance. As the late Lord Bingham emphasis in his seminal book 'The Rule of Law', '[t]he right to a fair trial is a cardinal requirement of the rule of law'.\"",
            "\"The concept of a fair procedure, which is constitutionally guaranteed in Article 87 of our Basic Law, is inherent in the concept of active case management.\"",
            "The Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, in his closing remarks likewise quoted from Lord Bingham's book \"The Rule of Law\" that \"fairness is a constantly evolving concept, not frozen at any moment of time\" and that \"[t]his is most obviously true of criminal trials\". Mr Yeung said, \"That underlines the value of our Criminal Law Conference, in that we can all take time out of our busy schedule, sit back and reflect on the ever evolving question of fairness.\"",
            "Two overseas guest speakers, the Honourable Justice William Young of the Supreme Court of New Zealand and Professor David Ormerod, the Law Commissioner for Criminal Law and Evidence, England and Wales, shared their views on the topics. Representatives of the Bar Association, the Law Society and the Department of Justice were also invited to speak on the issues.",

            "約120名司法人員、刑事法律執業者和學者今日（五月二十日）參與「二○一七年刑事法律研討會」，探討多個有關香港的刑事法律和刑事司法日常工作的最新發展的議題。",
            "該研討會由律政司刑事檢控科、香港大律師公會和香港律師會合辦，為刑事司法制度內各持份者提供一個平台，讓他們就香港的刑事司法制度的未來發展交流意見。",
            "今日的研討會涵蓋四個議題，分別為：積極的個案管理、對易受傷害人士在法庭上的保護、香港有關共同犯罪的法律，以及量刑的發展。",
            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師在研討會的開幕儀式上表示，刑事司法制度是香港法治體系最重要的元素之一，是香港法治的基礎。",

            "袁國強續說：「為達致這目標，確保公平審訊的法律和程序措施至為重要。正如已故兵咸勳爵（Lord Bingham）在他的著作《法治》（The Rule of Law）中強調，『公平審訊的權利是法治的基本要求。』」",
