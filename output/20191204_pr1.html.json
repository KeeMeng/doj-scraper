            "Following is a question by the Dr Hon Priscilla Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (December 4):",
            "Question:",
            "Since the eruption of the movement of opposition to the proposed legislative amendments (the movement) in June this year, there have been persons, one after another, being charged with various offences. It has been reported that some persons, claiming to be \"a group of prosecutors\" within the Department of Justice (DoJ), issued an anonymous open letter on July 31 this year using the DoJ's letterhead, criticising the ways in which senior personnel of the DoJ dealt with the cases involving large-scale public events. Besides, in a case mentioned at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts on November 4 this year, as the name of one of the five defendants stated in the DoJ's consent to prosecution was wrong and discrepancies were found between the Chinese and English versions of an offence, all of the five defendants had the charges against them withdrawn by the prosecution and were released at the Court. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether the DoJ has conducted an internal investigation into the aforesaid open letter, including the identity of the senders of the letter; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;",
            "(2) whether the DoJ has compiled statistics on the number of prosecutions relating to the movement so far where errors have been found in the relevant internal procedure or prosecution documents; if so, of the details; and",
            "(3) of the DoJ's measures to ensure that prosecutors uphold the principles of impartiality, probity and care in dealing with prosecutions relating to the movement?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "As the Secretary for the Civil Service (SCS) has recently reiterated to the public, the Government has always attached great importance to the conduct of civil servants. According to the Civil Service Code (the Code) issued by the Civil Service Bureau (CSB), civil servants are required to uphold the core values of commitment to the rule of law, honesty and integrity, objectivity and impartiality, political neutrality, etc. The Government has an established mechanism for handling the civil service disciplinary matters. Generally speaking, where there is any act, conduct or behaviour of an officer which contravenes the Code or government regulations, their respective department will take appropriate follow-up actions in accordance with established procedures. If there is evidence that a civil servant has misconducted himself upon investigation, or a civil servant has been convicted of criminal offence by the Court, the management will take appropriate disciplinary action, including imposing disciplinary punishment of verbal warning, written warning, reprimand, severe reprimand, reduction in rank, compulsory retirement and dismissal, etc.",
            "The above mechanism is applicable to civil servants of different grades and ranks including prosecutors of the Department of Justice (DoJ).",
            "In relation to the Dr Hon Priscilla Leung's question, the DoJ's reply after consulting the CSB is as follows:",
            "(1) According to the Code, all civil servants should uphold the rule of law and the administration of justice, and always observe due process. Civil servants shall also ensure that no actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest shall arise between their official duties and private interests. They shall also ensure that their personal views expressed would not impede their performance of official duties in a professional and fair manner. Prosecutors of the DoJ, as civil servants, should also comply with these rules. In view of recent social events, SCS issued letters to all civil servants twice in August and November this year respectively, reminding that they must remain politically neutral. The DoJ has also separately reminded all staff of the Department the above principles.",
            "Insofar as the Prosecutions Division of the DoJ is concerned, according to paragraph 1.2 of the publicised Prosecution Code, a prosecutor must not be influenced by any investigatory, political, media, community or individual interest or representation. As prosecutors of the DoJ, they shall ensure that their duties are discharged in a professional and impartial manner without being affected by their political assertion and personal views expressed. They shall remain independent and impartial. Therefore, prosecutors shall, before expressing their views in public, first consider whether such views would affect public perception towards the independence of the prosecutors of the DoJ, especially when there is a likelihood of handling relevant cases in future.",
            "On the other hand, following the guidelines issued by the Administration Wing, each department has established clear and comprehensive procedures for handling complaints against the department. All complaints, whether signed or anonymous, will be duly processed by the receiving department. For anonymous complaints, if the complaint itself does not contain sufficient information and where the complainant cannot be reached to provide further details, it might be difficult for the department concerned to conduct effective investigation or follow up.",
            "The DoJ has been handling each complaint, including the open letter referred to in the question, in accordance with the above guidelines. We note the open letter was issued by persons claiming to be \"a group of prosecutors\" within the DoJ using a letterhead appearing to be the DoJ's. However, expressing views in such anonymous way makes it difficult to trace the real identities of persons concerned for follow up with them and impossible to verify the allegations in the letter. After comprehending the overall situation, I and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) have earlier made a bold statement to dismiss such completely groundless allegations.",
            "(2) The DoJ does not maintain the relevant figures.",
            "Generally, when conducting prosecutions, including handling prosecution documents, prosecutors of the DoJ are required to act prudently in strict accordance with the law and the Prosecution Code. They are obliged to apply the highest of standard in their handling of all criminal cases. Regarding the handling of the case mentioned at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts on November 4 this year, the DoJ had made submissions to the Court, which were accepted by the Court. As the defendants concerned have been immediately arrested and charged, and the relevant legal proceedings remain ongoing, it is not appropriate for the DoJ to comment further.",
            "(3) As pointed out in the preamble and part (1) of the reply above, civil servants are required to comply with the relevant Code and regulations, as well as additional regulations issued by their respective departments. When civil servants express their views, they should also ensure that their views would not give rise to any conflict of interest with their official duties or might not be seen to be biased when discharging their duties.",
            "Civil servants' performance is assessed in an honest, objective and comprehensive manner in their appraisal reports. The Government will take appropriate actions on any misconduct committed by civil servants in accordance with the established procedures, including imposing disciplinary punishment on the officers concerned. If the case reveals that an officer is suspected of committing a criminal offence, the case will be referred to the relevant law enforcement agency to follow up. All civil servants of the DoJ, including prosecutors, are also subject to the same mechanism.",
            "I must emphasise that prosecutors of the DoJ always abide by Article 63 of the Basic Law and shoulder the constitutional duty enshrined therein, and handle all prosecution work in a fair, impartial and highly transparent manner. Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that \"the DoJ of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference\".",
            "All investigations of criminal cases are conducted by law enforcement agencies which will, when necessary, refer to the DoJ for independent decisions on whether to prosecute. The Prosecution Code provides reference points and guidance for prosecutors. They should at all times exercise integrity and care. The independence, role and duties of prosecutors are set out in the Prosecution Code. One of the basic principles set out in paragraph 3.1 of the Code is:",
            "\"A prosecutor is required to comply with and promote the rule of law. A prosecutor acts on behalf of the community in an impartial manner and as a 'minister of justice'. To this end, a prosecutor must fairly and objectively assist the court to arrive at the truth and to do justice between the community and the accused according to law.\"",
            "In deciding whether or not to prosecute, the DoJ must make an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and applicable law, and act in accordance with the Prosecution Code.",
            "The Secretary for Justice, the DPP and the prosecution team have all along been discharging their prosecutorial duties fairly and without prejudice or favour in accordance with the above principles so as to safeguard criminal justice.",

            "以下是今日（十二月四日）在立法會會議上梁美芬議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "反修例運動自本年六月爆發以來，陸續有人被控干犯各類罪行。據報，本年七月三十一日，有自稱是律政司內「一群檢控人員」的人士使用律政司信箋發出一封匿名的公開信，批評律政司高層處理涉及大型公眾活動案件的手法。此外，本年十一月四日在東區裁判法院提堂的一宗案件中，由於律政司檢控同意書中五名被告的其中一人的姓名出錯及控罪的中英文版不一致，五名被告獲控方撤銷控罪和當庭釋放。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）律政司有否就上述公開信進行內部調查，包括發信人的身分；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；",
            "（二）律政司有否統計至今有多少宗與反修例運動有關的檢控個案，有關的內部程序或檢控文件有出錯的情況；如有，詳情為何；及",
            "（三）律政司有何措施確保檢控人員秉持公正廉潔及謹慎從事的原則處理與反修例運動有關的檢控個案？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "正如公務員事務局局長最近多次向公眾重申，政府一向非常重視公務員的品行操守。根據公務員事務局制訂的《公務員守則》，公務員必須恪守堅守法治、誠實可信、廉潔公正、行事客觀、不偏不倚、政治中立等基本信念。政府有既定機制處理公務員紀律事宜。一般而言，公務員的行為、操守和表現如違反守則或政府規例，其所屬部門會按既定程序採取適當的跟進行動。如在調查後當局認為有證據顯示有關公務員有不當行為或有公務員被法院裁定干犯刑事罪行，管方會採取適當的紀律行動，包括口頭警告、書面警告、譴責、嚴厲譴責、降級、迫令退休或革職等紀律處分。",
            "以上機制適用於所有不同職系及職級的公務員，包括在律政司的檢控人員。",
            "就梁美芬議員的提問，律政司經諮詢公務員事務局後回覆如下。",
            "（一）根據《公務員守則》，所有公務員必須維護法治和司法公正，亦須依循適當程序辦事。公務員也必須確保公職與私人利益之間不會出現實際、觀感上或潛在利益衝突。公務員須確保自己所發表的個人意見，無損他們以專業、不偏不倚的態度有效地執行公務。律政司檢控人員作為公務員，也必須遵從這些守則。就近期的社會事件，公務員事務局局長於今年八月及十一月兩度向全體公務員發公開信，提醒公務員必須保持政治中立，律政司亦另有提醒司內所有人員注意上述原則。",
            "就律政司刑事檢控科而言，根據公開的《檢控守則》第1.2段，檢控人員不得受任何涉及調查、政治、傳媒、社群或個人的利益或陳述的因素影響。作為律政司的檢控人員，他們必須確保其個人立場及以個人身分發表的意見，無礙他們以專業、不偏不倚的態度執行職務，並應該保持獨立及公正。因此，檢控人員在公開表達個人意見前，尤其日後有機會處理相關的案件時，必須先考慮公開發表該等意見會否影響外界對律政司檢控人員獨立性的觀感。",
            "另外，各部門根據行政署發出的指引均設有具體及完整的程序處理關於該部門的投訴。部門接獲投訴後，不論具名或匿名，均會審慎處理。就匿名投訴，如投訴個案資料不足而又未能聯絡投訴人以進一步了解情況，部門或難以作出有成效的調查和跟進。",
            "律政司一貫按照上述指引處理每宗投訴，包括題述的公開信。我們留意到，該信由自稱律政司內「一群檢控人員」的人士使用看似律政司信箋發出。惟以此等不具名方式表達意見，既令人難以判斷有關人士的真正身分以向該等人士作出跟進，亦使信件內的指控無法得以辯證。早前，在了解整體情況後，我和刑事檢控專員亦已作出嚴正聲明，有關指控完全沒有事實根據。",
            "（二）律政司沒有備存問題要求提供的數字。",
            "一般而言，律政司的檢控人員進行所有檢控工作時，包括處理檢控文件，均須嚴格按照法律和《檢控守則》下的相關指引謹慎行事，並有責任以最高的專業標準處理所有刑事案件。就本年十一月四日在東區裁判法院提堂的一宗案件的處理情況，律政司在庭上已作出陳述，法庭亦已接納律政司的解釋。由於與該案有關的被告已隨即被捕和被控，而司法程序仍在進行中，律政司不適宜作進一步評論。",
            "（三）如上文序言及第（一）部分答覆指出，公務員須遵守相關的公務員守則和規例，以及他們所屬部門發出的額外守則，而公務員在表達意見時，他們亦須確保有關意見不會與其本身職務產生利益衝突，或可能令人覺得或會懷疑他們在執行職務時可能會有所偏袒。",
            "公務員的工作表現會如實、客觀和全面地反映於其評核報告中。就公務員的不當行為、操守和表現，當局會按既定程序採取適當的跟進行動，包括向有關人員採取紀律處分。如當局認為個案顯示有人涉嫌干犯刑事罪行，便會把個案轉介相關執法機關跟進。律政司的所有公務員，包括檢控人員，亦受上述同一機制規限。",
            "我必須強調，律政司的檢控人員一直恪守《基本法》第六十三條，肩負起該條訂下的憲制責任，並以公平、公正和高透明度的方式處理所有檢控工作。《基本法》第六十三條訂明：「香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」。",
            "所有刑事案件的調查工作由執法機關負責，執法機關有需要時才會交予律政司獨立決定是否提出檢控。《檢控守則》為檢控人員執行檢控工作提供參考基準和指引。律政司的檢控人員在任何時間皆秉持公正廉潔，謹慎從事，而檢控人員的獨立性、角色及職務，《檢控守則》也有詳細闡述。當中《檢控守則》第3.1段提及的一個基本原則是：",
            "「檢控人員必須遵行和提倡法治。檢控人員代表社會，行事不偏不倚，負責『秉行公義』。為此，檢控人員必須公正客觀地協助法庭找出真相，於社會與被控告之間，依法秉公行義。」",
            "律政司在作出檢控與否的決定時，必須就所得證據和適用法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按《檢控守則》行事。",
            "律政司司長、刑事檢控專員及刑事檢控科團隊在進行檢控工作時，一直秉持上述原則行事，不偏不倚、一視同仁，以維持司法公義。",

            "就近期的社會事件，公務員事務局局長於今年八月及十一月兩度向全體公務員發公開信，提醒公務員必須保持政治中立，律政司亦另有提醒司內所有人員注意上述原則",
            "就律政司刑事檢控科而言，根據公開的《檢控守則》第1.2段，檢控人員不得受任何涉及調查、政治、傳媒、社群或個人的利益或陳述的因素影響",
            "作為律政司的檢控人員，他們必須確保其個人立場及以個人身分發表的意見，無礙他們以專業、不偏不倚的態度執行職務，並應該保持獨立及公正",
            "因此，檢控人員在公開表達個人意見前，尤其日後有機會處理相關的案件時，必須先考慮公開發表該等意見會否影響外界對律政司檢控人員獨立性的觀感",
            "另外，各部門根據行政署發出的指引均設有具體及完整的程序處理關於該部門的投訴",
            "部門接獲投訴後，不論具名或匿名，均會審慎處理",
            "就匿名投訴，如投訴個案資料不足而又未能聯絡投訴人以進一步了解情況，部門或難以作出有成效的調查和跟進",
            "律政司一貫按照上述指引處理每宗投訴，包括題述的公開信",
            "我們留意到，該信由自稱律政司內「一群檢控人員」的人士使用看似律政司信箋發出",
            "惟以此等不具名方式表達意見，既令人難以判斷有關人士的真正身分以向該等人士作出跟進，亦使信件內的指控無法得以辯證",
            "早前，在了解整體情況後，我和刑事檢控專員亦已作出嚴正聲明，有關指控完全沒有事實根據",
            "（二）律政司沒有備存問題要求提供的數字",
            "一般而言，律政司的檢控人員進行所有檢控工作時，包括處理檢控文件，均須嚴格按照法律和《檢控守則》下的相關指引謹慎行事，並有責任以最高的專業標準處理所有刑事案件",
            "就本年十一月四日在東區裁判法院提堂的一宗案件的處理情況，律政司在庭上已作出陳述，法庭亦已接納律政司的解釋",
            "由於與該案有關的被告已隨即被捕和被控，而司法程序仍在進行中，律政司不適宜作進一步評論",
            "（三）如上文序言及第（一）部分答覆指出，公務員須遵守相關的公務員守則和規例，以及他們所屬部門發出的額外守則，而公務員在表達意見時，他們亦須確保有關意見不會與其本身職務產生利益衝突，或可能令人覺得或會懷疑他們在執行職務時可能會有所偏袒",
            "公務員的工作表現會如實、客觀和全面地反映於其評核報告中",
            "就公務員的不當行為、操守和表現，當局會按既定程序採取適當的跟進行動，包括向有關人員採取紀律處分",
            "如當局認為個案顯示有人涉嫌干犯刑事罪行，便會把個案轉介相關執法機關跟進",
            "律政司的所有公務員，包括檢控人員，亦受上述同一機制規限",
            "我必須強調，律政司的檢控人員一直恪守《基本法》第六十三條，肩負起該條訂下的憲制責任，並以公平、公正和高透明度的方式處理所有檢控工作",
            "《基本法》第六十三條訂明：「香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」",
            "所有刑事案件的調查工作由執法機關負責，執法機關有需要時才會交予律政司獨立決定是否提出檢控",
            "《檢控守則》為檢控人員執行檢控工作提供參考基準和指引",
            "律政司的檢控人員在任何時間皆秉持公正廉潔，謹慎從事，而檢控人員的獨立性、角色及職務，《檢控守則》也有詳細闡述",
            "當中《檢控守則》第3.1段提及的一個基本原則是：",
            "「檢控人員必須遵行和提倡法治",
            "檢控人員代表社會，行事不偏不倚，負責『秉行公義』",
            "為此，檢控人員必須公正客觀地協助法庭找出真相，於社會與被控告之間，依法秉公行義」",
            "律政司在作出檢控與否的決定時，必須就所得證據和適用法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按《檢控守則》行事",
            "律政司司長、刑事檢控專員及刑事檢控科團隊在進行檢控工作時，一直秉持上述原則行事，不偏不倚、一視同仁，以維持司法公義",
