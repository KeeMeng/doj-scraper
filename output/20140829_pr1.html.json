            "Mr Poon was addressing a seminar entitled \"Hong Kong - An International Hub for Legal & Arbitration Services\", which was jointly organised by the Department of Justice, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Singapore, and the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce & Industry.",
            "Mr Poon said, \"Given its close proximity to Myanmar and the availability of seasoned legal professionals, Hong Kong is an ideal place to conduct international commercial transactions. It is also a preferred venue for arbitration of commercial disputes for Myanmar businesses, particularly disputes with foreign and Chinese companies.\"",
            "He outlined the key aspects of Hong Kong's advantages in this area including a strong legal infrastructure, an arbitration-friendly approach adopted by Hong Kong courts, a strong legal profession, user-friendly arbitration legislation, ease of enforcing awards made in Hong Kong, a diverse pool of international arbitrators, world-class arbitration institutions and Hong Kong's strategic positioning as a gateway to Mainland China.",
            "\"I have high hope that our legal and arbitration bodies may build on their existing ties and make further efforts to enhance co-operation and share their professional experience in matters such as promotion of legal services and arbitration,\" Mr Poon said.",
            "The seminar was attended by more than 260 professionals from the legal and business sectors from both Hong Kong and Myanmar.",
