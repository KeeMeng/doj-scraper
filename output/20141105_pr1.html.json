            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) added a Public Order Events section to its newly revised Prosecution Code (the new Code) released in September last year to provide guidelines and pointers to prosecutors. The section states that as there are provisions in the Basic Law guaranteeing Hong Kong residents freedoms in respect of speech, association, assembly, procession and demonstration, etc., \"[o]ffences alleged to have been committed in conjunction with the exercise of these constitutionally guaranteed freedoms may give rise to special considerations\" (special considerations). I have learnt that regarding this type of cases, the Police need to await DoJ's consent before they may institute prosecutions even if they have got sufficient evidence. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether DoJ has issued to the prosecutors specific working guidelines on how they should make the special considerations, and what measures it has put in place to ensure that making the special considerations will not complicate and lengthen the prosecution procedures;",
            "(2) of the total number of cases involving public order events handled by DoJ since the issuance of the new Code and, among such cases, the respective numbers of those for which prosecutions have been and have yet to be instituted; the average time taken by the authorities for making prosecution decisions for such cases, and how it compares with the time taken for other cases in which the Police may institute prosecutions directly; and",
            "(3) given comments that despite a number of people having been arrested at the assembly venues of the recent occupation movement for alleged breaches of the law, the authorities have not, after a long time, instituted prosecutions against such people because the Police have to gather substantial evidence for such cases to enable prosecutors to make the special considerations, resulting in the public misunderstanding that persons breaching the law at the assembly venues will neither be prosecuted nor incur criminal liabilities, of DoJ's remedial measures to clear such public misunderstanding?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Article 63 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) provides that the Department of Justice (DoJ) shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference. The DoJ has always been controlling criminal prosecutions on behalf of the HKSAR on that basis so as to ensure that justice is done. A decision on whether to prosecute any individual or organisation is just as important for the suspect and the victim as it is for the community as a whole. Hence, with public interest in mind, prosecutors must act without fear or favour, and in accordance with the relevant law and evidence. The DoJ will treat all implicated parties equally and in accordance with the law, irrespective of their background, identity and social status.",
            "Prosecution should only be brought when there is cogent and credible evidence in support. According to paragraph 5.3 of the current Prosecution Code, when considering whether to prosecute, prosecutors must first consider whether there is sufficient evidence. If so satisfied, prosecutors should next consider and balance all issues of public interest. A prosecution shall not be commenced or continued unless there is a reasonable prospect of conviction. A prosecution which is not supported by evidence will not only be unfair to the defendant(s), but will also lead to a waste of court resources. Prosecutors have always acted in strict compliance with the Prosecution Code in handling prosecutions and incidental works to ensure that an effective and fair criminal justice system is maintained.",
            "All prosecution decisions are made in accordance with the law, the Prosecution Code and the evidence, totally free from any political, media or public pressure. In considering whether or not to prosecute an alleged breach of criminal law during a public order event, the DoJ will adopt the same principles as those adopted when handling other criminal cases, i.e. to consider whether there is sufficient evidence in support of the charge, and whether it is in the public interest to prosecute.",
            "The DoJ's reply to the three-part question raised by Dr the Hon Elizabeth Quat is as follows:",
            "(1) Taking into account the circumstances in which prosecutors operate and operational need, the DoJ published the latest Prosecution Code in September last year. The Prosecution Code covers specific offences in the form of dedicated sections. In the section on Public Order Events, it makes references to the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and landmark court decisions, including the judgment delivered by the Court of Final Appeal in Yeung May-wan v HKSAR (2005) 8 HKCFAR 137, so as to remind prosecutors of the well established legal principles applicable to the handling of cases related to public order events.",
            "The Prosecution Code also reminds prosecutors that offences alleged to have been committed in conjunction with the exercise of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms may give rise to special considerations. The purpose is to ensure that in handling such cases, prosecutors will strike an appropriate balance between the interest of society and maintaining public order on the one hand, and the right of individuals to lawfully and peacefully exercise their constitutionally guaranteed freedoms on the other.",
            "In fact, prosecutors have all along made references to the relevant statutory provisions, judgments and principles involved when handling cases involving public order events. It should be pointed out that the Prosecution Code does not prescribe any special procedures to be followed before the prosecution of cases involving public order events can be commenced. The new Prosecution Code does not complicate or lengthen the prosecution procedures. Nor is there any need for more specific working guidelines for prosecutors in the handling of these cases.",
            "(2) The Prosecution Code took effect on September 7, 2013. The DoJ has not, whether before or after this date, kept figures about the number of legal advices rendered in relation to public order events or the number of cases involved, or any breakdown as to the number which have recommended prosecution and the number which have yet to. We also have not maintained statistics on the average time taken for making prosecution decisions for such cases.",
            "Based on the figures on prosecutions involving public order events maintained by the Police, for the period between September 2013 and June 2014, the number of public order events is 5,529. As at 8 September 2014, the number of public order events involving prosecutions is 12, and the number of protestors prosecuted is 16.",
            "(3) As I have pointed out in part (1) of the reply, the section on Public Order Events added to the latest edition of the Prosecution Code only serves to remind prosecutors of the basic legal principles applicable to the handling of cases concerning public order events. Hence, there is no question of imposing new requirements on the gathering of evidence by law enforcement agencies, nor resulting in any more time spent by the Police in gathering evidence or delaying the decision to institute prosecution. The DoJ will at all times seek to provide legal advice to law enforcement agencies including the Police as expeditiously as possible, and the actual time that it takes to provide legal advice on each case depends on various factors, including mainly the nature and complexity of the case. Among cases submitted to the DoJ for legal advice, the number of suspects and the complexity of the cases may also vary. The responsible prosecutor may require more time to go through the evidence, analyse the facts of the case, and, where necessary, advise on the appropriate manner to handle the case.",
            "In order to achieve better efficiency in the handling of cases concerning public order events and with a view to ensuring consistency of approach as far as possible, the DoJ has set up a small dedicated team of prosecutors within the Prosecutions Division to handle such cases, so that professional legal advice can be provided to the Police as expeditiously as possible so as to enable early referral of cases which merit prosecution to the courts for adjudication.",
            "Lastly, I hope to take this opportunity to emphasise that the DoJ will continue to maintain communication with the Police in respect of any illegal acts involved in the \"Occupy Central\" activities, and will handle relevant prosecution work in a timely manner.",

            "以下為今日（十一月五日）在立法會會議上葛珮帆議員的提問和律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的答覆：",
            "問題︰",
            "律政司於去年九月發表的新修訂《檢控守則》（新《守則》），增訂了有關「公眾秩序活動」的章節，為檢控人員提供指導方針及提示。該章節訂明，鑑於《基本法》有條文保障香港居民享有言論、結社、集會、遊行、示威等自由，「如有聲稱指干犯的罪行是同時涉及行使這些受憲法保障的自由，檢控人員或需作出特別考慮」（特別考慮）。本人獲悉，對於該類案件，警方即使有足夠的證據，仍需等待律政司同意，才可提出檢控。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）律政司有否就檢控人員如何作出特別考慮，向他們發出具體的工作指引，以及有何措施確保作出特別考慮不會令檢控程序更加繁複及費時；",
            "（二）由新《守則》發出至今，律政司共處理了多少宗涉及公眾秩序活動的案件，當中分別有多少宗已提出及尚未提出檢控；當局就該類案件作出檢控決定平均所需時間，與警方可直接提出檢控的其他案件所需時間如何比較；及",
            "（三）鑑於有評論指出，儘管已有多人在近日佔領行動的集會地點因涉嫌違法而被捕，但由於警方需就有關案件搜集大量證據以供檢控人員作特別考慮，以致當局遲遲未能向該等人士提出檢控，令公眾誤以為在集會地點違法的人不會被檢控亦無須負刑責，律政司有何補救措施，以消除公眾誤解？",
            "答覆︰",
            "主席︰",
            "《基本法》第六十三條規定，香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉。律政司一直本該原則代表香港特別行政區掌管刑事檢控工作，從而彰顯公義。是否對個別人士或團體提出檢控的決定，對涉嫌犯罪的人、受害者，以至整個社會，都同樣重要。因此，檢控人員必須不偏不倚，以公眾利益為大前提下依據相關法律和證據行事。對任何涉案的人，無論其背景、身分或地位，律政司都會依法處理，一視同仁。",
            "檢控人員在處理檢控工作時，必須憑藉有力而可信的證據才應提出檢控。根據現行的《檢控守則》第5.3段，檢控人員對每宗案件，都要首先考慮證據是否充分，然後權衡公眾利益，才作出檢控決定。除非案件有合理定罪機會，否則不會提出或繼續檢控。如果檢控缺乏理據，不單對被告人不公平，也會浪費法庭資源。檢控人員一直嚴格遵照《檢控守則》處理檢控及相關工作，以確保維持公平有效的刑事司法制度。",
            "所有檢控決定均按照法律、《檢控守則》及證據作出，完全不受任何政治、傳媒或公眾壓力所影響。在考慮是否就在「公眾秩序活動」中涉嫌觸犯刑事法律的行為作出檢控時，律政司採納的原則與處理其他刑事檢控個案並沒有分別，即要考慮證據是否充分，及提出檢控是否符合公眾利益。",
            "就葛珮帆議員提問的三部分，律政司的回應如下：",
            "（一）因應檢控人員面對的情況及工作需要，律政司於去年九月出版最新的《檢控守則》。該《檢控守則》內就個別具體罪行以專章形式處理，而當中有關「公眾秩序活動」的章節，提述《基本法》、香港人權法及法院重要裁決的相關參考資料，包括終審法院就楊美雲 訴 香港特別行政區（2005） 8 HKCFAR 137一案的裁決，藉此提示檢控人員在處理有關公眾秩序活動案件時適用及已被廣為確立的法律原則。",
            "《檢控守則》亦提醒檢控人員如有聲稱指干犯的罪行是同時涉及行使憲法保障的自由時，或需作出特別考慮，目的是確保在處理該類案件時能求取應有的平衡，一方面符合社會利益和維持公眾秩序，另一方面讓大眾人士可合法及和平地行使憲法保障的自由。",
            "事實上，檢控人員在過去處理有關「公眾秩序活動」的案件時，亦一直有參考相關法例、裁決及原則。但必須指出，《檢控守則》並未有要求就有關「公眾秩序活動」的案件必須經過任何特別程序處理，才可作出檢控。因此，並不會出現新的《檢控守則》令檢控程序較以往繁複或費時的情況，亦沒有需要為檢控人員在處理相關案件時訂出更具體的工作指引。",
            "（二）《檢控守則》於二○一三年九月七日生效。在上述日期之前或之後，律政司均未有備存曾處理的有關「公眾秩序活動」的法律意見或所涉及的案件的數目，以及當中已提出及尚未提出檢控的個別數字。我們亦沒有就有關案件作出檢控決定平均所需時間進行統計。",
            "而根據警方備存涉及公眾活動的檢控數字，於二○一三年九月至二○一四年六月期間，公眾活動的數目為5,529宗。截至二○一四年九月八日止，當中涉及有檢控的活動數目為十二宗，被檢控的示威人士則為十六名。",
            "（三）正如我在第（一）部分的答案中指出，最新版本的《檢控守則》所加入有關「公眾秩序活動」的章節，只是向檢控人員提示在處理有關「公眾秩序活動」案件時適用的基本法律原則，因此並不存在對執法機關在搜證方面有新的要求，亦不會令警方需要花額外時間搜集證據，或使決定是否提出檢控的時間拖長。而無論任何時候，律政司都會竭盡所能，盡快為包括警方在內的執法機關提供法律意見。而就每宗案件給予法律意見所需的時間，則視乎眾多因素而定，主要包括案件的性質和複雜程度。在提交律政司尋求法律指引的個案中，牽涉嫌疑人的數目和案情的複雜性亦會有所不同，負責檢控人員有可能需要更多時間審視證據、分析個案的案情，以及在有需要時就處理有關個案的適當方法提供指引。",
            "為更有效率處理有關「公眾秩序活動」的案件，並盡量保持處理的方法的一致性，律政司刑事檢控科設有一小隊的檢控人員專責處理這類案件，務求盡快為警方提供專業法律指引，並就應進行檢控的案件提交司法機關處理。",
            "最後，我希望借此機會強調，就「佔中」涉及的違法行為，律政司會繼續與警方保持溝通，並會適時處理相關檢控工作。",

            "而根據警方備存涉及公眾活動的檢控數字，於二○一三年九月至二○一四年六月期間，公眾活動的數目為5,529宗",
            "截至二○一四年九月八日止，當中涉及有檢控的活動數目為十二宗，被檢控的示威人士則為十六名",
            "（三）正如我在第（一）部分的答案中指出，最新版本的《檢控守則》所加入有關「公眾秩序活動」的章節，只是向檢控人員提示在處理有關「公眾秩序活動」案件時適用的基本法律原則，因此並不存在對執法機關在搜證方面有新的要求，亦不會令警方需要花額外時間搜集證據，或使決定是否提出檢控的時間拖長",
            "而無論任何時候，律政司都會竭盡所能，盡快為包括警方在內的執法機關提供法律意見",
            "而就每宗案件給予法律意見所需的時間，則視乎眾多因素而定，主要包括案件的性質和複雜程度",
            "在提交律政司尋求法律指引的個案中，牽涉嫌疑人的數目和案情的複雜性亦會有所不同，負責檢控人員有可能需要更多時間審視證據、分析個案的案情，以及在有需要時就處理有關個案的適當方法提供指引",
            "為更有效率處理有關「公眾秩序活動」的案件，並盡量保持處理的方法的一致性，律政司刑事檢控科設有一小隊的檢控人員專責處理這類案件，務求盡快為警方提供專業法律指引，並就應進行檢控的案件提交司法機關處理",
            "最後，我希望借此機會強調，就「佔中」涉及的違法行為，律政司會繼續與警方保持溝通，並會適時處理相關檢控工作",
