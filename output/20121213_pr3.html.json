            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC speaking to the media about the foreign domestic helper's right of abode appeal today (December 13):",
            "Secretary for Justice: The Department of Justice (DoJ) filed the Respondents' Case in the foreign domestic helper (FDH)'s right of abode (ROA) appeal in accordance with Court of Final Appeal (CFA)'s appeal procedures yesterday afternoon. As the Respondents' Case is a court document and as the hearing of the case has yet to begin, DoJ did not disclose the document or its content. There is however a news report today suggesting that DoJ would make use of the FDH case to ask the CFA to seek an interpretation from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) pursuant to Article 158(3) of the Basic Law (BL 158(3)) in order to clarify the legal effect of the NPCSC's Interpretation made in 1999 and to resolve the problems created by babies born in Hong Kong to mainland couples who have no resident status in Hong Kong, the so-called Mainland pregnant women problem.",
            "As the Government's arguments in the FDH case have been disclosed by third parties and as an academic has warned that the \"turbulent storm\" of our legal system, which Bokhary NPJ is wary of, is approaching, I would like to make a few remarks.",
            "Firstly, since judicial process of the FDH case is on-going, DoJ has not disclosed its arguments or strategies in that case. This is consistent with the Department's usual practice and legal procedures. DoJ also does not wish to unduly affect judicial independence by such disclosure.",
            "Secondly, DoJ invites the CFA to consider seeking the NPCSC's interpretation under BL 158(3) to clarify the legal effect of the 1999 Interpretation because this is a relevant issue which needs to be resolved in the present case. The penultimate paragraph of the 1999 Interpretation stated that the legislative intent of all categories of BL 24(2) has been reflected in the \"Opinions on Implementation of Article 24(2) of the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the PRC\" adopted by the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR in 1996. The legal status of the 1999 Interpretation and the 1996 Opinions of the Preparatory Committee and their binding effect therefore involve complex legal issues. If such issues can be clarified, DoJ considers that the clarification can facilitate a proper interpretation of the right of abode for all categories of persons under BL 24(2) including FDHs.",
            "Thirdly, this is not a case where the Government requests the NPCSC for an interpretation. Instead, the Government, under the Hong Kong judicial system, requests in accordance with BL 158(3) the CFA to consider whether to refer to the NPCSC the legal issues on the 1999 Interpretation for clarification.",
            "That the CFA may decide whether to refer to the NPCSC for an interpretation is a mechanism under BL 158(3). It is a mechanism under the constitutional order of the HKSAR. BL 158 clearly provides that the ultimate power to interpret the Basic Law is vested in the NPCSC. Hong Kong courts may on its own interpret provisions of the Basic Law in adjudicating cases. There is also a constitutional duty on the part of the CFA to refer provisions concerning affairs which are the responsibility of the CPG, or concerning the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region, to the NPCSC for interpretation in accordance with BL 158(3) if the conditions under this provision are satisfied.",
            "Most importantly, whether to refer to the NPCSC for an interpretation is a decision to be made by the CFA in accordance with our common law. Therefore, there can hardly be any damage to the rule of law or jeopardising our judicial independence. It is exactly because of the consideration of judicial independence that the DoJ had not publicised the way in which the FDH case is handled.",
            "In the past, as in the Congo case, the CFA had referred to the NPCSC for an interpretation of the Basic Law in accordance with BL 158(3). At that time, the two legal professional bodies, the legal profession and the international community generally recognised that such measure would not affect judicial independence or the rule of law in Hong Kong.",
            "As I have repeatedly stated in other occasions in the past, this Government absolutely respects the rule of law and judicial independence. We would adopt the same cautious attitude in handling the FDH case and the Mainland pregnant women problem. Therefore, I do not agree that DoJ's handling of the FDH case would bring on turbulent storm to the rule of law of Hong Kong.",
            "Finally, I would reiterate that the request by the DoJ for the CFA to consider referring to the NPCSC for clarifying the effect of the 1999 Interpretation under BL 158(3) would absolutely not affect the rule of law and judicial independence of Hong Kong. On the contrary, this measure would hopefully assist to resolve the right of abode issue of different categories of persons, including foreign domestic helpers and babies born to Mainland pregnant women. This is also consistent with the idea that I have emphasised in the past: that is to resolve the relevant issue under the legal system of Hong Kong.",
            "Reporter: In layman's term, are you asking the Court of Final Appeal for seeking interpretation from the NPC before it determines on the case, and if you are, are you going back on what you said to the reporters that in so far if possible, the case should be resolved within the system in Hong Kong?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I am not going back on my words as to how to handle the issue in question. As I said earlier, the way to refer any relevant issue to be interpreted by NPCSC under article 158(3) is in fact built in as part of our Basic Law, and it is also to go through the process filtered by the Court of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal, of course, is part of our legal system. As I said earlier, the final decision whether or not to make any reference under article 158(3), that final decision, if I may stress and reiterate again, is to be made by the Court of Final Appeal, and by the Court of Final Appeal alone. Therefore that is a mechanism and a way which is (a) constitutional, (b) is built in and enshrined in our Basic Law, and (c) is perfectly within the Hong Kong's legal system.",
            "Reporter: There is the question of whether you are asking the court to go back and look at the Preparatory Committee's decision under this matter prior to the handover, which is later accepted by the NPCSC?",
            "Secretary for Justice: The question of the binding nature or the extent to which it was binding in fact has never been previously clearly adjudicated by the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong. If you go back to the case of Chong Fung Yuen, in fact that is a point which there was an expressive paragraph in the Court of Final Appeal judgement, that that point was not argued, it was simply being proceeded on the basis of whole parties' assumption as a result of concession made by the Government at the time. Therefore if I may make it absolutely clear that that was a point which has never ever been adjudicated by the Court of Final Appeal. Therefore there was no question of going back and also if I may say, that at the end of the day, whether on the question of making any references to NPCSC under article 158(3) or how that is to be dealt with or approached, the final decision is to be made by the Court of Final Appeal upon hearing submissions by both parties.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（十二月十三日）下午會見傳媒的談話全文︰",
            "律政司司長︰昨日下午，律政司依上訴程序，向終審法院提交就外傭居港權上訴案的書面陳述。由於該書面陳述是法庭文件，而且上訴聆訊仍未展開，因此律政司從來沒有向外公開該文件或其內容。今日有報章報道，律政司希望借外傭案件請求終審法院考慮依據《基本法》第 158(3)條向人大常委會尋求釋法，澄清人大常委會一九九九年釋法的法律效力，從而解決雙非問題。",
            "由於律政司在外傭案件的論點已被第三者向外間披露，更有學者指早前包致金法官擔憂的暴風雨真的來了，有見及此，我希望向大家簡述有關情況。",
            "第一，由於外傭案件仍然在司法程序處理中，因此律政司一直沒有向外界說明律政司在該案的論點或處理手法。這是律政司一貫的做法，亦是符合法律上的相關要求，更絕對不希望影響司法獨立。",
            "第二，今次律政司在外傭案中請求終審法院考慮向人大常委會尋求澄清一九九九年釋法的效力，確實是因為在處理外傭案件中有需要向終審法院提出《基本法》第 158(3)條的請求。一九九九年的釋法曾指出，《基本法》第 24(2)條的立法原意，已體現在香港特區籌備委員會於一九九六年通過的《關於實施〈中華人民共和國香港特別行政區基本法〉第二十四條第二款的意見》。因此，一九九九年的釋法和一九九六年籌委會的意見在香港法律制度下的法律地位和約束力涉及複雜的法律問題，律政司認為這些問題的澄清將有助解決所有《基本法》第24(2)條下不同類別人士，包括外傭居港權的問題。",
            "第三，今次並非政府要求人大常委釋法，而是我們在香港的司法體系下，請求終審法院考慮是否根據《基本法》第 158(3)條向人大常委尋求澄清一九九九年釋法的法律問題。",
            "由於終審法院決定是否向人大常委尋求釋法是《基本法》第158(3)條下的機制，亦是香港特區憲制的機制。《基本法》第 158 條明確規定《基本法》的最終解釋權屬於人大常委會。香港法院在審理案件時可以自行解釋《基本法》條文。假如有《基本法》第 158(3)條規範以內的情況，終審法院有責任根據該條款提請人大常委會，對相關的條款作出解釋。",
            "最重要的是，是否向人大常委尋求釋法由終審法院根據普通法作決定，因此我們認為絕對不存在破壞法治或影響司法獨立。律政司沒有向外公開這項處理方法，正正亦是不希望影響司法獨立。",
            "在去年剛果（金）案，終審法院亦依據《基本法》第158(3)條向人大常委會尋求釋法，當時兩個律師會、法律界及國際社會也普遍認為這方式不會影響司法獨立或香港的法治。",
            "正如我過往在多個場合多次重申，現屆政府絕對尊重法治和司法獨立，亦會以同樣態度謹慎處理外傭案和雙非問題。因此我不認同律政司用上述處理外傭案的方式會為香港的法治帶來暴風雨，這點我是絕對不認同。",
            "最後，我再次強調今次律政司請求終審法院考慮依據《基本法》第 158(3)條尋求人大常委澄清一九九九年釋法的法律效力，絕對不會影響香港法治和司法獨立；相反地，這方式希望有助解決不同類別人士，包括外傭及雙非嬰兒的居港權的法律問題，亦符合我過往強調希望透過本地法律體系，以解決相關問題的理念。",
            "記者︰相關《基本法》列明釋法只適用於國防和外交或中港事務，但入境條例或居留權問題是香港的內部事務，為何要建議釋法？釋法是否沒有底線，甚麼事都可以釋法？在這案件裏，法院說一九九九年的釋法不適用，仍判政府勝訴，為何仍要建議釋法？這案件的上訴贏面很大，這是否一個藉口，順便解決雙非問題？",
            "律政司司長︰首先，這絕對不是一個藉口，在外傭案件上，無論在原訟庭或上訴庭，代表政府的資深大律師很清楚向法院表示，政府保留處理相關問題，所以絕對不是藉口，而這是因為有需要而做。有關詳細的內容，由於外傭案件現時仍處於司法程序，所以相關的論點詳情，我不可以詳細透露。至於記者問到是否沒有底線，絕對不是。首先，我認為一九九九年釋法內容的效力範圍，其實是涉及《基本法》第 158 條的內容，因此符合相關規定，最終決定是否有需要或是否符合第 158 條向人大常委提請釋法，不是律政司說了算，而是由終審庭進行相關的辯論，最終如剛果案件一樣，由終審法院根據香港的基本法、根據我們的普通法處理相關問題。",
            "記者︰若終審法院拒絕政府的要求，政府有沒有下着？為何要等包致金法官離開終審法院後才做這動作？",
            "律政司司長︰首先，我以前亦對大家提過，有關處理雙非問題的所有方案，律政司內部對每一個方案都曾經作出詳細研究，而我上次在廣州會見傳媒時，亦有提及就相關問題，有請外間的，包括香港的資深大律師和英國的御用大律師，就相關問題提供專家的法律意見，這方面我們每一個方案都有考慮，包括這記者提及的，我們都有考慮過。時間上的關係，絕對和這記者剛才所說的完全無關，我可以保證完全無關。因為究竟日後這個外傭案由哪個法官聽審，律政司完全不能控制，外傭案何時開審，亦不是律政司可以控制。我們純粹就相關合適的案件在香港《基本法》和其他法例下面可以容許的情況下，做我們認為在法律下適合的事情，亦不存在任何向法庭施加壓力。我希望澄清今次這件事，這個方法向外間透露並非由律政司透露，我今次向大家講述這個情況，是因為看到今早報章不知道在甚麼情況下，消息向報界披露了，我亦知道報章或其他的傳媒非常關注這個問題，所以在短時間下麻煩大家來到這裏，向大家簡單地解釋這件事，所以並不存在任何壓力，亦希望在此重申，正如我剛才所說，日後是否就這個問題向人大常委尋求就一九九九年就釋法的澄清，這是香港終審法院的決定，亦希望大家對香港終審法院法官有信心，他們會知道怎樣處理這問題。",
            "記者︰是否還包括其他建議？抑或只建議向人大常委提請釋法，因為有學者提出可由法院自我修正，這是否會更合乎司長所言的在本地法律體系裏解決事件？",
            "律政司司長︰我說得很清楚，今次向終審法院建議考慮就《基本法》第 158(3)條提請人大澄清一九九九年釋法，純粹因為我們在處理外傭案時，我們覺得無論在法律和相關法例的考慮下，有需要、亦合適這樣做。我們並非如外間一些傳聞，說我們藉這案件希望做到其他與法律上不符合或有矛盾的目的，因此我們在外傭案引用第158(3)條時，我們希望就外傭引起的法律問題考慮是否就 158(3)條需要向人大提請釋法，所以並不存在這位記者所言的事情。我再澄清，絕對不存在任何意圖向法院或任何司法人員施加壓力，這個絕對並無這個意思，亦正因如此，我們從未在公開場合提出這問題。今次我出來解釋，並非因為律政司透露這件事，而是在我們不清楚的情況下，這消息向外間披露了。",
            "記者︰若釋法，會影響莊豐源案，這是否一個壞先例，律政司要求終審法院推翻過往的裁決？",
            "律政司司長︰我可以肯定地告訴你，這不會是個壞先例。我期望大家了解，是否向人大尋求澄清，須由終審法院法官自行決定。在決定的過程中，法官清楚向人大尋求釋法時，可能出現的情況。第二，大家都知道，普通法制度下，先例是非常重要，但並非未試過法院認為適當的情況下，法院沒有百分之百依從以前的先例。這情況若由法庭自己在考慮所有相關法律和案情之後決定這樣做的話，這不會是個壞先例，這些事情以往在香港的法律制度，在其他普通法法律制度下亦曾試過，最終最重要的，改或不改的決定非由行政機關去做，而是由司法機構自行決定，這一點是完全符合香港法治，亦不會開壞先例或構成壓力，此種種都不會存在，希望大家明白。",

            "最後，我再次強調今次律政司請求終審法院考慮依據《基本法》第 158(3)條尋求人大常委澄清一九九九年釋法的法律效力，絕對不會影響香港法治和司法獨立；相反地，這方式希望有助解決不同類別人士，包括外傭及雙非嬰兒的居港權的法律問題，亦符合我過往強調希望透過本地法律體系，以解決相關問題的理念",
            "記者︰相關《基本法》列明釋法只適用於國防和外交或中港事務，但入境條例或居留權問題是香港的內部事務，為何要建議釋法？釋法是否沒有底線，甚麼事都可以釋法？在這案件裏，法院說一九九九年的釋法不適用，仍判政府勝訴，為何仍要建議釋法？這案件的上訴贏面很大，這是否一個藉口，順便解決雙非問題？",
            "律政司司長︰首先，這絕對不是一個藉口，在外傭案件上，無論在原訟庭或上訴庭，代表政府的資深大律師很清楚向法院表示，政府保留處理相關問題，所以絕對不是藉口，而這是因為有需要而做",
            "有關詳細的內容，由於外傭案件現時仍處於司法程序，所以相關的論點詳情，我不可以詳細透露",
            "至於記者問到是否沒有底線，絕對不是",
            "首先，我認為一九九九年釋法內容的效力範圍，其實是涉及《基本法》第 158 條的內容，因此符合相關規定，最終決定是否有需要或是否符合第 158 條向人大常委提請釋法，不是律政司說了算，而是由終審庭進行相關的辯論，最終如剛果案件一樣，由終審法院根據香港的基本法、根據我們的普通法處理相關問題",
            "記者︰若終審法院拒絕政府的要求，政府有沒有下着？為何要等包致金法官離開終審法院後才做這動作？",
            "律政司司長︰首先，我以前亦對大家提過，有關處理雙非問題的所有方案，律政司內部對每一個方案都曾經作出詳細研究，而我上次在廣州會見傳媒時，亦有提及就相關問題，有請外間的，包括香港的資深大律師和英國的御用大律師，就相關問題提供專家的法律意見，這方面我們每一個方案都有考慮，包括這記者提及的，我們都有考慮過",
            "時間上的關係，絕對和這記者剛才所說的完全無關，我可以保證完全無關",
            "因為究竟日後這個外傭案由哪個法官聽審，律政司完全不能控制，外傭案何時開審，亦不是律政司可以控制",
            "我們純粹就相關合適的案件在香港《基本法》和其他法例下面可以容許的情況下，做我們認為在法律下適合的事情，亦不存在任何向法庭施加壓力",
            "我希望澄清今次這件事，這個方法向外間透露並非由律政司透露，我今次向大家講述這個情況，是因為看到今早報章不知道在甚麼情況下，消息向報界披露了，我亦知道報章或其他的傳媒非常關注這個問題，所以在短時間下麻煩大家來到這裏，向大家簡單地解釋這件事，所以並不存在任何壓力，亦希望在此重申，正如我剛才所說，日後是否就這個問題向人大常委尋求就一九九九年就釋法的澄清，這是香港終審法院的決定，亦希望大家對香港終審法院法官有信心，他們會知道怎樣處理這問題",
            "記者︰是否還包括其他建議？抑或只建議向人大常委提請釋法，因為有學者提出可由法院自我修正，這是否會更合乎司長所言的在本地法律體系裏解決事件？",
            "律政司司長︰我說得很清楚，今次向終審法院建議考慮就《基本法》第 158(3)條提請人大澄清一九九九年釋法，純粹因為我們在處理外傭案時，我們覺得無論在法律和相關法例的考慮下，有需要、亦合適這樣做",
            "我們並非如外間一些傳聞，說我們藉這案件希望做到其他與法律上不符合或有矛盾的目的，因此我們在外傭案引用第158(3)條時，我們希望就外傭引起的法律問題考慮是否就 158(3)條需要向人大提請釋法，所以並不存在這位記者所言的事情",
            "我再澄清，絕對不存在任何意圖向法院或任何司法人員施加壓力，這個絕對並無這個意思，亦正因如此，我們從未在公開場合提出這問題",
            "今次我出來解釋，並非因為律政司透露這件事，而是在我們不清楚的情況下，這消息向外間披露了",
            "記者︰若釋法，會影響莊豐源案，這是否一個壞先例，律政司要求終審法院推翻過往的裁決？",
            "律政司司長︰我可以肯定地告訴你，這不會是個壞先例",
            "我期望大家了解，是否向人大尋求澄清，須由終審法院法官自行決定",
            "在決定的過程中，法官清楚向人大尋求釋法時，可能出現的情況",
            "第二，大家都知道，普通法制度下，先例是非常重要，但並非未試過法院認為適當的情況下，法院沒有百分之百依從以前的先例",
            "這情況若由法庭自己在考慮所有相關法律和案情之後決定這樣做的話，這不會是個壞先例，這些事情以往在香港的法律制度，在其他普通法法律制度下亦曾試過，最終最重要的，改或不改的決定非由行政機關去做，而是由司法機構自行決定，這一點是完全符合香港法治，亦不會開壞先例或構成壓力，此種種都不會存在，希望大家明白",
