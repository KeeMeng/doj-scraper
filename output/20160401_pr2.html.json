            "Following is the transcript of remarks made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at a media session after attending the Legislative Council Finance Committee special meeting today (April 1):",
            "Reporter: Do you stand by your statement that merely advocating independence is in breach of the Basic Law and how does this fit in the provision which guarantees freedom of expression in Hong Kong?",
            "Secretary for Justice: First of all, I stand by the statement that the Department of Justice (DoJ) issued. But I'm afraid I cannot agree with the subsequent part of your question. I think in the statement we make it crystal clear that, point number one, the suggestion or any advocacy that Hong Kong should become an independent state is contrary to the Basic Law and in particular, as pointed out in our statement, is contrary to Article 1 as well as Article 12 of the Basic Law because the very fact that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was created in 1997 was pursuing to Article 31 of the PRC (People's Republic of China) Constitution and that by itself underlined or underpinned the legal or constitutional status of Hong Kong. So in other words, quite apart from Article 1, it is quite clear that the status of Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region bespeaks the unique status of Hong Kong. So to suggest or to advocate independence is contrary to the Basic Law. And if you also go to Article 11 of the Basic Law, which also makes it crystal clear that all the other legislations or all the other laws of Hong Kong cannot be inconsistent with the Basic Law and that is exactly the reason why there have been so many explanations or people have been explaining that the Basic Law is of a higher level than the other ordinary legislations or common law. And therefore, if someone is advocating something which is contrary to the fundamental principle as expounded in the Basic Law, it's quite clearly contrary to the Basic Law.",
            "But point number two, as to whether we should take any action, that's the subsequent part of our statement. What we are saying is, since someone has openly come out to suggest that they are going to act contrary to our Basic Law, therefore, I think as a responsible government and insofar as the Department of Justice is concerned, as a responsible department administering the issues concerning the law, I think we would have to closely monitor the situation. As to what we would do, we would follow the same procedure as in other cases, namely, when things happen, the law enforcement agency would decide whether or not to conduct investigation and if they have the results, they would pass on the investigation results to DoJ. We would look at it. My colleagues would consider the applicable law and the evidence and then will decide what to do. So at this stage, we would not be commenting whether we would be taking what actions.",
            "Reporter: How does your statement fit in with the provision that guarantees the freedom of expression because people are just talking about independence?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I think freedom of expression, as has been accepted in many instances and in fact there can be many examples, freedom of expression is not without limit. For instance, in civil law, there is the law of defamation. That is one example to show that the law concerning freedom of expression, freedom of speech, is not without limit. And therefore, one cannot use freedom of speech as a shield to defend suggestions which are contrary to the fundamental principle expounded in the Basic Law. Therefore, there is absolutely no inconsistency and I hope people should not confuse freedom of expression with suggestion which is quite blatantly contrary to the Basic Law.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（四月一日）出席立法會財務委員會特別會議後，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者：剛才你提到執法部門須要搜證，如果只是違反《基本法》是否有執法部門須要搜證？如果不是只是《基本法》，是有些本地刑事法例違反了，有哪些條例可能會涉及？",
            "律政司司長：我相信大家如有留意當日他們的記者招待會，特別是他們宣布這一個黨創立時的記者招待會和他們之後的言論，其實他們在解說其政治理念和行動時，大家可能也留意到，他們有講及他們可能會採取的手段，詳情我不在此重複。鑑於他們的解說，我們認為有必要審視這個情況，所以日後若他們不只是開記者招待會，而是有其他行動，當然我們要密切留意。另一方面，若他們是一個政黨或其他的團體，如果我沒有記錯，他們在公開場合亦有談論過他們跟公司註冊處或其他方面去註冊團體這方面的事宜，這些我相信大家也不會否認亦會涉及法律考慮，所以這一方面我們作為律政司這個處理法律的部門，我們亦有責任去跟進。",
            "記者︰有法律意見指，若他們倡議用一種暴力推翻現時中國共產黨的政權才會所謂違法，講「港獨」這東西其實不算違法，因為是一種言論自由。你是否認同這種法律觀點？另外李波的案件，他自己承認偷渡回內地，現時可自由出入中港兩地，其實現在政府有沒有任何跟進？還是把事件當作完結、不了了之？",
            "律政司司長︰先回答你第一條問題。我希望，或者這樣說，我不希望任何人會以身試法，亦不希望我們現時談的這件事的香港民族黨的相關人士以身試法。所以至於說，他自己應該做些甚麼，若他們認為他們有不清楚的話，他們可以諮詢他們的法律意見，這是我給他們的忠告。至於往後我們會用甚麼法例，剛才我也說得很清楚，現階段我不可能在未有一個調查報告，或事件未發生前，我不可能現在去說，對任何人也不公平，對我的同事，或對有可能涉及這件事的人亦不公平，亦不是一個正常的程序。你剛才第二個問題，有關李波先生的事件，正如剛才我在委員會回答問題時亦說過，我的理解是警方仍然繼續調查這件事，在我們香港政府的立場來說，我們仍然希望可以採取相關的跟進行動，所以未有一個句號可以劃上去。謝謝大家。",
