            "In response to the public procession today (October 1), a Government spokesman said that the Basic Law provides constitutional protection to Hong Kong's legal system, judicial independence, human rights and the rule of law.",
            "\"Judges and judicial officers in Hong Kong have been deciding cases professionally and independently, including those relating to public order events and human rights. Judicial decisions are made independently after fair and open hearings on the basis of the evidence adduced in court and the applicable law. Political consideration does not come into play at all. Those convicted of criminal offences have the right to apply for review or appeal in regard to their convictions and sentences in accordance with legal procedures.",
            "\"The Department of Justice (DoJ) is committed to safeguarding the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong, as well as keeping criminal prosecutions free from any interference. The DoJ has all along been handling all criminal cases in accordance with the applicable law, relevant evidence and the Prosecution Code. No political consideration is being taken into account at all. The allegations of political prosecution or persecution are entirely unfounded. Not only do these allegations ignore the evidence accepted by the court or undisputed evidence in these cases, they also disregard the decisions of the court,\" the spokesman said.",
            "\"As regards the case concerning the charging at the ground floor lobby of the Legislative Council Complex in 2014, and also the case involving Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow, the Court of Appeal pointed out clearly in the two Judgments concerning the application for review of sentence, that the defendants were not convicted or sentenced for exercising the freedom of assembly, demonstration or expression; instead, they were convicted and sentenced because their conduct overstepped the line permitted by the law, including conduct involving violence.\"",
            "The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region fully respects freedom of speech and the rights to petition and hold public processions. However, as repeatedly pointed out by the court, those freedom and rights are not absolute. People must respect the law when exercising such rights.",

            "政府發言人回應今日（十月一日）的遊行時表示，《基本法》為本港的法律制度、司法獨立、人權和法治提供憲制保障。",
            "發言人説：「本港法官和司法人員一直專業和獨立地處理案件，包括涉及公共秩序和人權的案件。法庭在公平公開的審訊中，根據呈堂證據和適用法律，作出獨立的判決，不存在任何政治因素，被判有罪的人亦有權依據司法程序就其判決及刑罰申請覆核或上訴。」",
            "「律政司亦致力維護本港法治和司法獨立，其刑事檢控工作不受任何干涉。律政司一直只依據適用法律、相關證據和《檢控守則》處理所有刑事案件，當中不存在任何政治考慮。有關政治檢控或迫害的指控全無任何事實基礎，不但漠視各案件中獲法庭信納或沒有爭議的證據，更無視法庭的判決。」",
            "「就二○一四年衝擊立法會大樓地下大堂，以及涉及黃之鋒、羅冠聰和周永康的兩宗刑期覆核案件，上訴庭的判案書清楚指出，各被告不是因為行使集會、示威或言論等權利而被定罪或判刑，而是他們的行為已超越法律的界線，包括涉及暴力行為。」",
            "香港特區政府一直尊重言論、示威、集會等自由和權利。但正如法庭多次指出，該等自由和權利並非絕對，巿民行使該等權利時亦必須尊重法律。",
