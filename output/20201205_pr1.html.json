            "In response to the criminal intimidation against a judicial officer, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government issued the following statement today (December 5):",
            "Judicial independence, free from any interference, is guaranteed under Article 85 of the Basic Law and upheld by the HKSAR Government all along. A judicial officer in performing his judicial duties has received intimidation, threatening to hurt his family members, with an attempt to influence the court decisions. The HKSAR Government and any law-abiding jurisdiction will not tolerate such violent and illegal acts. Police are taking resolute enforcement action so as to apprehend the culprit as soon as possible and safeguard the city's public peace and safety.",
            "In regard to the groundless accusations against court decisions from local and overseas communities lately, the Department of Justice (DoJ) strongly appeals to all members of the communities to stop attacking our judicial system by any means. These acts may breach the laws and the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (National Security Law). The National Security Law clearly stated that a person who organises, plans, commits or participates in any of the acts by force or threat of force or other unlawful means to seriously interfering in, disrupting, or undermining the performance of duties and functions in accordance with the law by the body of power of the HKSAR shall be guilty of an offence. No one should defy the law.",
            "The DoJ has all along been safeguarding the due administration of justice and upholding the rule of law. The Secretary for Justice as guardian of public interest applied to the Court for an ex parte injunction to restrain persons from unlawfully and wilfully conducting doxxing activities against Judicial Officers and their family members, or intimidating, harassing or threatening the same. The Court of First Instance of the High Court has granted an interim injunction to restrain persons from unlawfully and willfully conducting themselves in those acts. Any person who violates the interim injunction order may be held in contempt of court, and is liable to imprisonment or a fine. If any unlawful and willful doxxing activity is found, the DoJ will refer the case to the Police at once for enforcement action. A prosecution would be commenced if there is sufficient evidence. Offenders have to bear the legal responsibility.",
            "Members of the public have the right to express their views or engage in discussions on court decisions and related matters within the boundary permitted by the law. However, one must respect the judicial independence when expressing their views, and should not arbitrarily attack members of the Judiciary.",
            "The DoJ urges that any person who is dissatisfied with court decisions may lodge appeals through the excising mechanism and should not criticise judicial officers abusively or even intimidate them. Otherwise, not only would the rule of law in Hong Kong be undermined, it is also against the law. The unlawful radical behaviour is not acceptable in our society. The HKSAR Government will follow up on all the illegal acts in accordance with the law to safeguard public peace in a steadfast manner, enabling all the bodies of power of the HKSAR to continue to perform their duties and functions in accordance with the law.",

            "對於有司法人員遭受恐嚇，特區政府今日（十二月五日）發出以下聲明：",
            "《基本法》第八十五條保障司法獨立，不受干擾，特區政府一直致力捍衞。司法人員因履行司法職能而被人惡意恐嚇會傷害其家庭成員，以企圖影響法庭的裁判，特區政府以至任何一個法治社會都絕對不會姑息這種違法暴戾的行為，警方必定嚴正執法，務求將不法分子盡早緝拿歸案，確保社會安寧。",
            "對於近日法庭的裁決遭受本地以至海外社會的無理批評，律政司強烈呼籲社會上所有人士必須停止以任何手段攻擊我們的司法制度，有關行為有機會觸犯法例以及《香港國安法》。《香港國安法》清晰訂明：任何人組織、策劃、實施或參與實施以武力、威脅使用武力或其他非法手段嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特區政權機關依法履行職能，即屬犯罪。任何人都不應該以身試法。",
            "律政司一直捍衞法治和維護司法公正。為禁止對司法人員及其家庭成員進行非法和故意的「起底」行為、恐嚇、煩擾或威脅，律政司司長作為公眾利益守護者向法庭單方面申請禁制令，高等法院原訟法庭亦已批准臨時禁制令，禁止任何人非法和故意地從事該等行為。任何違反臨時禁制令的人士有可能干犯藐視法庭，會被判處監禁或罰款。一旦發現有非法和故意的「起底」行為，律政司會即時轉介警方執法，有足夠證據會提出起訴，違法者須要承擔法律責任。",
            "社會人士有權在法律容許的範圍內就法庭的裁決或相關事項發表意見或作出討論，但發表意見時必須尊重司法獨立，亦不應該肆意抨擊司法人員。",
            "律政司呼籲，任何人如不服案件的裁決，應該透過現行制度提出上訴，絕不應該惡言攻擊甚至恐嚇司法人員，否則不單對香港的法治造成損害，亦會觸犯法律。激進的非法行為是社會不能接受的，特區政府會以堅定的態度，依法嚴肅跟進所有不法行為，保障社會安寧，讓特區所有政權機構均可以繼續依法履行職能。",
