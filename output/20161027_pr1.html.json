            "The Department of Justice has in its response to media enquiries of October 17, 2016 (response), explained the reasons why the department withdrew the prosecution against the defendant in a case at a residential care home for persons with disabilities. The Department of Justice has since received a number of further enquiries on the same case, to which the department has also replied. In view of the community's concerns over the case, the Department of Justice today (October 27) issued this consolidated statement so as to help the public appreciate the reasons for the department's withdrawal of the prosecution concerned and to clarify certain misunderstandings.",
            "Prosecution Policy",
            "According to the Prosecution Code:",
            "There must be legally sufficient evidence to support a prosecution; that is, evidence that is admissible and reliable and, together with any reasonable inferences able to be drawn from it, likely to prove the offence. (Para. 5.4.)",
            "The test is whether the evidence demonstrates a reasonable prospect of conviction. (Para. 5.5.)",
            "The public interest is not served by proceeding with cases that do not satisfy this test. (Para. 5.7.)",
            "A prosecutor remains under a duty continually to review a prosecution that has been commenced. The prosecution must be discontinued if, following a change of circumstances, a reapplication of the prosecution test at any stage indicates that the evidence is no longer sufficient to justify a reasonable prospect of conviction or the interests of public justice no longer require the prosecution to proceed. (Para. 10.1.)",
            "The Complainant's evidence in this case",
            "If the Complainant had been fit to give evidence, her evidence would have been direct evidence in support of the charge.",
            "Generally speaking, in criminal cases, to prove the truth of what a witness has seen or said, the witness has to personally appear in court to give evidence under oath and tell the court what he or she has seen or said. Otherwise, what the witness has seen or said would be classified as \"hearsay evidence\" from the legal perspective and is not admissible in court. Hence, the record of meeting(s) between a witness and other person(s) that took place before the court hearing normally cannot be admitted as evidence.",
            "However, according to section 79C of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (the Ordinance), unless an exception specified in that section applies, the court shall grant leave to admit as evidence a video recording made of an interview between a \"mentally incapacitated person\" and a police officer, or a social worker or clinical psychologist who is employed by the Government.",
            "One of the exceptions set out in section 79C(4) of the Ordinance is that \"it appears that the ... mentally incapacitated person will not be available for cross-examination\".",
            "Separately, section 79C(6)(a) of the Ordinance provides that:",
            "\"Where a video recording is admitted-",
            "The ... mentally incapacitated person shall be called by the party who tendered the recording in evidence;\"",
            "In this case, on as early as August 15, 2014, the prosecution had arranged for the Complainant to be video interviewed in accordance with the Ordinance, and planned to apply to the court for leave to admit the recording as evidence. The relevant application has subsequently been made to the court in accordance with the \"Live Television Link and Video Recorded Evidence Rules\" (Cap. 221J, Laws of Hong Kong).",
            "However, even with leave granted by the court, based on the above-referred legal provisions, the prosecution would still have to call the Complainant as a witness for cross-examination. Otherwise, the requirements of section 79C(4) of the Ordinance could not be fulfilled.",
            "The trial for the case was originally scheduled to commence on February 2, 2015. However, as the Complainant had been admitted to a hospital, the prosecution applied to the court to adjourn the trial. That was the first adjournment of the case. Subsequently during the period from March 2015 to April 2016, the prosecution had on six occasions obtained specialist medical reports on the Complainant through the Hospital Authority. The purpose was to assess whether the Complainant had recovered from post-traumatic stress disorder and become fit for cross-examination. In those various assessments, the Complainant was diagnosed to be suffering from the above-mentioned conditions and continued to be unfit to give evidence in court proceedings. A medical specialist even pointed out that if the Complainant were to be compelled to appear in court, it would cause enormous stress to her mental condition and threaten her chance of recovery. Taking into account the health condition of the Complainant and the contents of the above-mentioned specialist medical reports, the prosecution had on a total of four occasions applied to the court to adjourn the trial of the case. Earlier this year, the prosecution even specifically sought the expert advice of a medical specialist on the Complainant's prognosis. Ultimately, having considered carefully the views of all the specialists covering a period of more than one year, the prosecution came to the conclusion that the Complainant had remained unfit to be called as a witness, and it was not possible for the prosecution in the foreseeable future to call the witness for cross-examination in accordance with the requirement of section 79C(4).",
            "A resident of the residential care home concerned (Bridge of Rehabilitation Limited) has made available a video recording taken with a portable phone. That recording shows that the Complainant had, upon enquiry, replied that she had been assaulted by the defendant. The legal considerations mentioned above are equally applicable to this video recording. As a matter of law, if the Complainant cannot be called as a witness, the video recording cannot be produced as evidence to prove the truth of the answers given by the Complainant therein. Further, the individual interviewing the Complainant in that video recording was not a police officer, a social worker or a clinical psychologist employed by the Government. The recording could not be admissible as evidence under the Ordinance.",
            "Remaining circumstantial evidence in the circumstance that the Complainant could not be called",
            "Given the Complainant is unfit to give evidence, the prosecution had to consider whether the remaining evidence (after excluding the video recording record provided by the Complainant) would be sufficient for convicting the defendant. After detailed assessment, the Department of Justice formed the view that there was no reasonable prospect of proving any relevant charge against the defendant with the remaining evidence. The prosecution hence decided to withdraw the prosecution. The prosecution also raised with the judge its considerations of the evidence when objecting to the defendant's application for costs. The judge pointed out (in paragraph 17 of his Reasons for Decision) that \"the prosecution had no alternative but to withdraw the charges against the defendant\" (\"控方是在無奈情況下才撤銷對被告的指控\"). The \"Reasons for Decision in respect of the application for costs\" (Reasons for Decision) issued by the judge on October 4, 2016, is attached (in Chinese only).",
            "Paragraph 11 of the Reasons for Decision refers to another video recording. The duration of that recording is 1 minute and 11 seconds. It was taken by a resident with a portable phone from outside the defendant's office, in an attempt to record what was happening inside it through the door made of frosted glass. As the door was closed and made of frosted glass, the image captured was not clear. In the absence of evidence given by any individual inside the room, the recording could not prove the occurrence of any illegal acts inside the room. When considering the evidence of the case, and also before the ultimate decision to withdraw the prosecution, the prosecution had indeed very carefully considered this video recording.",
            "There was CCTV recording of the institution showing that the defendant and the Complainant had been in the defendant's office at the same time. However, as the recording could not capture what happened in the office at all, it was of even less use when compared with the video recording mentioned above.",
            "The Police had seized from the defendant's office tissue papers stained with the defendant's semen. The prosecution had also carefully considered the relevant forensic evidence, and raised it with the judge when opposing the defendant's application for costs. As the judge pointed out in paragraph 10 of his Reasons for Decision, \"(t)he Police discovered in the dust bin of the defendant's office six pieces of tissue papers (P17 and P18). It was confirmed, after laboratory tests, that these tissue papers had on them human semen. The DNA of the semen matched with that of the defendant, and the semen also contained a mixture of substances containing the DNA of the defendant and X.\" However, the prosecution was not able to obtain evidence to prove how the \"mixture of substances\" came about, the means by or the circumstances in which the DNA of the Complainant came to exist in the mixture, or from which part of the Complainant's body or type of bodily fluid which her DNA originated. Neither had the prosecution any evidence to rule out the possibility that the defendant's semen and the Complainant's DNA might have been left on the tissue papers concerned at different times.",
            "As such, there is no reasonable prospect of proving, by way of the circumstantial evidence mentioned above, that the defendant had had sexual intercourse with the Complainant, or that the defendant had committed indecent assault against her. The Department of Justice stresses that the decision to withdraw the prosecution was not made merely because of the fact that the Complainant could not be called. The case was withdrawn because, in the prosecution's view upon careful assessment of the overall evidence of the case, the remaining evidence in the absence of the Complainant's testimony, could not demonstrate a reasonable prospect of proving any relevant charge. If the department were of the view that the remaining evidence could still demonstrate a reasonable prospect of proving any criminal offence against the defendant, the department certainly would not have withdrawn the prosecution.",
            "Prosecution of cases involving \"vulnerable witnesses\" - reform and outlook",
            "As has been pointed out in the previous response, the Department of Justice has established procedures in handling the prosecution of cases involving vulnerable witnesses. In particular, the processing of the cases concerned would be expedited. \"The Statement on the Treatment of Victims and Witnesses\" (the Statement) sets out the rights of and the standard of service that victims and witnesses (including mentally incapacitated persons) should deserve in the criminal legal process. The Statement sets out the principles and guidelines regarding how the rights of witnesses (including mentally incapacitated persons) should be protected, e.g. where justified, prosecutors should make appropriate applications to the court for, e.g. the use of screens to shield witnesses while testifying in court, the use of two-way closed circuit television to enable witnesses to give evidence outside the courtroom through a televised link to the courtroom, and admission of video-recorded interviews as evidence-in-chief of witnesses who are mentally incapacitated persons.",
            "However, to respect the rule of law, prosecutors should, at the same time, consider the right of a defendant to a fair trial. A prosecutor remains under a duty continually to review a prosecution that has been commenced. The prosecution must be discontinued if, following a change of circumstances (as in the current case where the Complainant has become unfit to be called, and hence could not be cross-examined by the defence), a re-application of the prosecution test at any stage indicates that the evidence is no longer sufficient to justify a reasonable prospect of conviction or the interests of public justice no longer require the prosecution to proceed.",
            "The Department of Justice reiterates that it treats most seriously the rights of mentally incapacitated persons. We are aware and take note of the views of all interested individuals and organisations. In this regard, we shall examine the procedures in handling prosecutions involving mentally incapacitated persons to see if there is room for further improvement, so that we can better safeguard their rights.",
            "In respect of the law reform relating to \"hearsay evidence\", the Law Reform Commission published the \"Report on Hearsay in Criminal Proceedings\" in 2009 which contained detailed recommendations. One of the recommendations is to endow upon the court a discretion to admit \"hearsay evidence\" of a declarant who is unfit to be a witness because of his physical or mental condition, on the condition that the court is satisfied with the \"reliability\" of the evidence. After the publication of the report in September 2009, the Department of Justice consulted the Legislative Council Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services in April 2012. It also organised a (small-scale) forum on the way forward in May 2012, for which representatives of the Judiciary, the Bar and the Law Society were invited to attend. With the benefit of the above consultations, a working draft bill is being prepared by the Department of Justice, with a view to taking forward the next stage of the consultation exercise to seek the views of legal professional bodies, the Judiciary and other stakeholders. If the law reform can be implemented, it will be helpful in avoiding the situation where prosecution cannot proceed/continue to proceed as a result of a mentally incapacitated person not being able to appear in court to give evidence.",
            "It is hoped that the explanation set out above can address public concerns regarding the case in question.",

            "就一宗涉及在殘疾人士院舍發生的案件，律政司已於二○一六年十月十七日在回覆傳媒查詢（回覆）時，解釋律政司對被告撤銷檢控的原因，亦在其後數次回覆傳媒其他查詢時提供相關資料。鑑於社會對該案的關注，律政司今日（十月二十七日）作此綜合聲明，冀能有助公眾明白律政司決定撤銷檢控的原因及消除若干誤解。",
            "檢控政策",
            "根據《檢控守則》：",
            "控方必須在法律上有充分證據支持檢控，即是這些可接納和可靠的證據，連同可從這些證據作出的任何合理推論，相當可能會證明有關罪行。（5.4段）",
            "驗證標準是：根據這些證據，是否有合理機會達致定罪。（5.5段）",
            "案件不符合這項驗證標準卻繼續進行檢控，便不合乎公眾利益。（5.7段）",
            "檢控人員有責任持續覆核已展開的檢控工作。隨着情況有變，假如在任何階段重新應用檢控驗證標準而顯示有關證據不再足以確保有合理機會達至定罪，或繼續進行檢控不會符合社會公義，便應停止檢控。（10.1段）",
            "本案中女事主的證供",
            "如事主適宜作供，其證言會是支持控罪的直接證據。",
            "一般而言，在刑事案件中，證人須親自出庭在宣誓下作供，其所見所言才可被法庭接納為證據，以證明其所見所言屬實。否則，其所見所言在法律上只會被歸類為「傳聞證據」，不能呈堂。故此，證人在聆訊前與其他人所作的會面紀錄，一般不能獲接納為證據。",
            "然而，根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》（該《條例》）第79C條，除非有該條訂明的例外情況，否則法庭須就由一名「精神上無行為能力的人」與一名警務人員、政府所僱用的社會工作者或臨床心理學家之間的會面所作的錄影紀錄，給予許可，以接納該紀錄作為證據。",
            "該《條例》第79C（4）條訂明的其中一個例外情況是「看來該……精神上無行為能力的人將不能出席接受盤問」。",
            "該《條例》第79C（6）（a）條另外規定：",
            "「某錄影紀錄獲接納—",
            "提出該紀錄作為證據的一方須傳召該……精神上無行為能力的人；」",
            "在本案中，控方早在2014年8月15日已根據該《條例》安排事主提供錄影紀錄，並預備向法庭申請許可，接納該紀錄作為證據。相關申請文件其後亦已根據《電視直播聯繫及錄影紀錄證據規則》（香港法例第221J章）向法庭提出。",
            "然而，即使法庭給予許可，根據上述法律條文，控方仍須傳召事主為證人以接受盤問，否則不能符合該《條例》第79C（4）的要求。",
            "本案原定在2015年2月2日開審，但因事主因病入院，控方首次向法庭申請押後審訊。其後在2015年3月至2016年4月期間，控方先後6次經醫院管理局替事主索取專科醫療報告，以評估事主是否已從創傷後壓力症康復，並可接受盤問。在多次的醫療診斷中，事主均被評定因上述狀況而不適宜出庭作供，更有專科醫生指出，若強迫事主應訊，會對其精神狀況造成巨大壓力，危害其復原機會。基於事主的健康狀況及上述專科醫療報告內容，控方前後共4次向法庭申請押後案件。在今年年初，控方更特別要求專科醫生就事主創傷後壓力症的復原展望，提供專家意見。最終，控方在詳細考慮所有專家在超過一年內所提供的意見，認為事主仍不適宜應訊作供，控方在可見的將來，無法依照該《條例》第79C（4）的要求，傳召事主為證人以接受盤問。",
            "有一康橋之家的院友曾經提供一段手機錄影，指事主在查問下指被告曾侵犯她。上述法律考慮，同樣適用於這段錄像。在法律上，在事主不能作供的情況下，相關錄像並不可被接納為證供，以證明事主在錄像中稱曾發生的事情的確曾發生。再者，在該段手機錄影中向事主查問的人並不是一名警務人員、政府所僱用的社會工作者或臨床心理學家，片段不可根據該《條例》呈堂。",
            "在不能傳召事主下所餘的環境證據",
            "基於事主不適宜作供，控方須考慮在剔除事主所提供的錄影紀錄後，餘下的證據能否仍令被告入罪。經詳細評估後，律政司認為所餘證據沒合理機會證明被告干犯任何相關控罪，因此才決定撤銷檢控。就有關證據的考量，控方亦有在反對被告申請訟費時向法官提出，法官（在裁決書第17段）指出「控方是在無奈情況下才撤銷對被告的指控」。現附上法官於2016年10月4日發出的「訟費申請裁決理由」（裁決書）。",
            "裁決書第11段提及另一段錄像。該錄像長1分11秒，由一院友在被告人辦公室外，透過辦公室的磨砂玻璃房門，以手機嘗試拍攝房內情況。由於房門關閉，並是磨砂物料，影像並不清晰，在缺乏房內的人的證供下，並不能證明曾發生任何非法行為。控方在考慮案件證據時，及在最後決定撤控前，有非常謹慎地考慮有關錄像。",
            "有院內的閉路電視拍得被告與事主曾同在被告的辦公室內。但因相關的片段完全拍不到房內發生的事情，其用處比上述的錄像還少。",
            "警方在被告的辦公室內搜得染有被告精液的紙巾。有關的法證，控方亦有審慎考慮，並在反對被告申請訟費時向法官提出。如法官在裁決書第10段指出，「警方在被告的辦公室內的垃圾桶找到6張紙巾（P17及P18）。這些紙巾經化驗後證實有人類精液。精液內的DNA和被告脗合，而這些精液內亦有被告和X的DNA脗合的混合物。」然而，控方無法取得證據，證明「混合物」如何出現，亦不能證明事主的DNA經何種途徑或在甚麼情況下出現在「混合物」內，或事主的DNA源自她身體那部分或那種體液。控方亦無證據排除被告的精液與事主的DNA是在不同時間沾在有關紙巾這可能性。",
            "因此，上述的環境證據並沒有合理機會證明被告曾與事主發生性行為，或被告曾非禮事主。律政司強調，撤控的決定，並不單純因事主未能出庭，而是因律政司在對案件整體證據作出最後評估後，認為在不能傳召事主下，所餘證據沒合理機會證明任何相關控罪。若律政司認為所餘證據仍有合理機會證明被告曾干犯任何控罪，絕不會撤銷檢控。",
            "涉及「易受傷害證人」的檢控案件——改革及前瞻",
            "如律政司在回覆中指出，就涉及「易受傷害證人」的檢控案件，律政司有既定程序處理。特別是，有關案件會被優先處理。《對待受害者及證人的陳述書》（《陳述書》）訂明受害者及證人（包括精神上無行為能力人士）在刑事法律程序中所享有的權利和應得的服務水平。《陳述書》就檢控人員如何保障證人（包括精神上無行為能力人士）的權益訂定守則及指引，例如在有充分理由支持下，檢控人員會向法庭提出適當的申請，包括當證人在庭上作供時，以屏障遮蔽證人、運用雙向閉路電視，使證人可以在法庭外通過電視聯繫方式向法庭作證，及接納精神上無行為能力的證人的會面錄影紀錄為主問證供等。",
            "但同時，在尊重法治的前提下，檢控人員亦須考慮被告人得到公正審判的權利。檢控人員有責任持續覆核已展開的檢控工作。隨着情況有變（就如在本案投訴人不適宜出庭作供，因此不能讓辯方盤問），假如在任何階段重新應用檢控驗證標準而顯示有關證據不再足以確保有合理機會達至定罪，或繼續進行檢控不會符合社會公義，便應停止檢控。",
            "律政司重申，律政司十分重視「精神上無行為能力人士」的權益。我們留意及關注到有關人士和團體提出的意見。就此，我們會審視處理涉及「精神上無行為能力人士」的檢控程序是否有進一步完善的空間，令他們的權益可以得到更佳的保障。",
            "就「傳聞證據」相關法律的改革，法律改革委員會在2009年發表的《刑事法律程序中的傳聞證據報告書》（報告書）中有詳細的建議。當中的一項，是賦予法庭酌情權，並在信納其「可靠」性的情況下，接納因身體或精神狀況而不適宜作證人的「傳聞證據」為證供。在有關報告書於2009年9月發表後，律政司在2012年4月諮詢立法會司法及法律事務委員會，並就未來路向於2012年5月舉辦小型論壇，邀請司法機構、香港大律師公會和香港律師會的代表參與。律政司現正根據上述諮詢的結果擬備條例草案的工作草稿，以期展開下一階段的諮詢工作，徵詢法律專業團體、司法機構，和其他持份者的意見。如有關法律改革得以落實，會有助避免因「精神上無行為能力」人士未能出庭作供，而導致不能進行或繼續進行檢控的情況。",

            "Ultimately, having considered carefully the views of all the specialists covering a period of more than one year, the prosecution came to the conclusion that the Complainant had remained unfit to be called as a witness, and it was not possible for the prosecution in the foreseeable future to call the witness for cross-examination in accordance with the requirement of section 79C(4).",
            "A resident of the residential care home concerned (Bridge of Rehabilitation Limited) has made available a video recording taken with a portable phone",

            "As a matter of law, if the Complainant cannot be called as a witness, the video recording cannot be produced as evidence to prove the truth of the answers given by the Complainant therein",
            "Further, the individual interviewing the Complainant in that video recording was not a police officer, a social worker or a clinical psychologist employed by the Government",
            "The recording could not be admissible as evidence under the Ordinance.",
            "Remaining circumstantial evidence in the circumstance that the Complainant could not be called",
            "Given the Complainant is unfit to give evidence, the prosecution had to consider whether the remaining evidence (after excluding the video recording record provided by the Complainant) would be sufficient for convicting the defendant",
            "After detailed assessment, the Department of Justice formed the view that there was no reasonable prospect of proving any relevant charge against the defendant with the remaining evidence",
            "The prosecution hence decided to withdraw the prosecution",
            "The prosecution also raised with the judge its considerations of the evidence when objecting to the defendant's application for costs",

            "Paragraph 11 of the Reasons for Decision refers to another video recording",
            "The duration of that recording is 1 minute and 11 seconds",
            "It was taken by a resident with a portable phone from outside the defendant's office, in an attempt to record what was happening inside it through the door made of frosted glass",
            "As the door was closed and made of frosted glass, the image captured was not clear",
            "In the absence of evidence given by any individual inside the room, the recording could not prove the occurrence of any illegal acts inside the room",
            "When considering the evidence of the case, and also before the ultimate decision to withdraw the prosecution, the prosecution had indeed very carefully considered this video recording.",
            "There was CCTV recording of the institution showing that the defendant and the Complainant had been in the defendant's office at the same time",
            "However, as the recording could not capture what happened in the office at all, it was of even less use when compared with the video recording mentioned above.",
            "The Police had seized from the defendant's office tissue papers stained with the defendant's semen",
            "The prosecution had also carefully considered the relevant forensic evidence, and raised it with the judge when opposing the defendant's application for costs",
            "As the judge pointed out in paragraph 10 of his Reasons for Decision, \"(t)he Police discovered in the dust bin of the defendant's office six pieces of tissue papers (P17 and P18)",
            "It was confirmed, after laboratory tests, that these tissue papers had on them human semen",
            "The DNA of the semen matched with that of the defendant, and the semen also contained a mixture of substances containing the DNA of the defendant and X.\" However, the prosecution was not able to obtain evidence to prove how the \"mixture of substances\" came about, the means by or the circumstances in which the DNA of the Complainant came to exist in the mixture, or from which part of the Complainant's body or type of bodily fluid which her DNA originated",
            "Neither had the prosecution any evidence to rule out the possibility that the defendant's semen and the Complainant's DNA might have been left on the tissue papers concerned at different times.",
            "As such, there is no reasonable prospect of proving, by way of the circumstantial evidence mentioned above, that the defendant had had sexual intercourse with the Complainant, or that the defendant had committed indecent assault against her",
            "The Department of Justice stresses that the decision to withdraw the prosecution was not made merely because of the fact that the Complainant could not be called",
            "The case was withdrawn because, in the prosecution's view upon careful assessment of the overall evidence of the case, the remaining evidence in the absence of the Complainant's testimony, could not demonstrate a reasonable prospect of proving any relevant charge",
            "If the department were of the view that the remaining evidence could still demonstrate a reasonable prospect of proving any criminal offence against the defendant, the department certainly would not have withdrawn the prosecution.",
            "Prosecution of cases involving \"vulnerable witnesses\" - reform and outlook",
            "As has been pointed out in the previous response, the Department of Justice has established procedures in handling the prosecution of cases involving vulnerable witnesses",
            "In particular, the processing of the cases concerned would be expedited",
            "\"The Statement on the Treatment of Victims and Witnesses\" (the Statement) sets out the rights of and the standard of service that victims and witnesses (including mentally incapacitated persons) should deserve in the criminal legal process",

            "where justified, prosecutors should make appropriate applications to the court for, e.g",
            "the use of screens to shield witnesses while testifying in court, the use of two-way closed circuit television to enable witnesses to give evidence outside the courtroom through a televised link to the courtroom, and admission of video-recorded interviews as evidence-in-chief of witnesses who are mentally incapacitated persons.",
            "However, to respect the rule of law, prosecutors should, at the same time, consider the right of a defendant to a fair trial",
            "A prosecutor remains under a duty continually to review a prosecution that has been commenced",
            "The prosecution must be discontinued if, following a change of circumstances (as in the current case where the Complainant has become unfit to be called, and hence could not be cross-examined by the defence), a re-application of the prosecution test at any stage indicates that the evidence is no longer sufficient to justify a reasonable prospect of conviction or the interests of public justice no longer require the prosecution to proceed.",
            "The Department of Justice reiterates that it treats most seriously the rights of mentally incapacitated persons",
            "We are aware and take note of the views of all interested individuals and organisations",
            "In this regard, we shall examine the procedures in handling prosecutions involving mentally incapacitated persons to see if there is room for further improvement, so that we can better safeguard their rights.",
            "In respect of the law reform relating to \"hearsay evidence\", the Law Reform Commission published the \"Report on Hearsay in Criminal Proceedings\" in 2009 which contained detailed recommendations",
            "One of the recommendations is to endow upon the court a discretion to admit \"hearsay evidence\" of a declarant who is unfit to be a witness because of his physical or mental condition, on the condition that the court is satisfied with the \"reliability\" of the evidence",
            "After the publication of the report in September 2009, the Department of Justice consulted the Legislative Council Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services in April 2012",
            "It also organised a (small-scale) forum on the way forward in May 2012, for which representatives of the Judiciary, the Bar and the Law Society were invited to attend",
            "With the benefit of the above consultations, a working draft bill is being prepared by the Department of Justice, with a view to taking forward the next stage of the consultation exercise to seek the views of legal professional bodies, the Judiciary and other stakeholders",
            "If the law reform can be implemented, it will be helpful in avoiding the situation where prosecution cannot proceed/continue to proceed as a result of a mentally incapacitated person not being able to appear in court to give evidence.",
