            "The Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) Asia Pacific Week 2015 kicked off today (November 9) with an international conference which drew the attendence of over 100 government officials, judges, legal practitioners, academics and representatives of non-governmental organisations from over 25 jurisdictions around the world.",
            "Jointly organised by the Department of Justice and the HCCH Asia Pacific Regional Office, the six-day HCCH Asia Pacific Week will focus on the discussion of cross-border legal issues concerning children and families.",
            "Addressing the opening of the Global Conference on Recovery of Child Support and Family Maintenance in Asia Pacific and Worldwide, the first programme of the HCCH Asia Pacific Week, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) places great importance on family law and the protection of children.",
            "\"We welcome opportunities to exchange views and to build up a network with other jurisdictions so as to ensure that our relevant legal regime can function effectively on the cross-border level,\" he said.",
            "He paid tribute to the HCCH Asia Pacific Regional Office for its continuous efforts in building up a network of regional stakeholders in the area of international family law since its official opening in the HKSAR in 2012, and pledged support for its works in family law and other areas.",
            "Mr Yuen noted that the cross-border recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance is important in at least two aspects.",
            "\"First, children deserve protection and it is important to ensure that children's rights and interests are properly protected. Whilst other means of protection are not unimportant, legal regimes can often play the role of the ultimate protector. Accordingly, a robust international network to facilitate the effective and efficient recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance is undoubtedly an important means to protect children.",
            "\"Second, we always talk about the rule of law in the domestic context. Indeed, the United Nations' philosophy of 'Justice for Children' maintains that 'the way children are treated by national legal, social welfare, justice systems and security institutions is integral to the achievement of the rule of law and its related aims'. However, the universally cherished notion of the rule of law also has an international dimension, and this dimension is commanding growing importance as a result of globalisation and regional integration. A transnational network which can facilitate prompt recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions definitely helps to uphold the rule of law on the international level,\" he said.",
            "He added that the national and regional systems on international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The 2007 Hague Child Support Convention and Protocol seeks to ensure the effective international recovery of such maintenance by establishing an efficient system of co-operation between contracting states and making available a comprehensive range of applications.",
            "Other major programmes of the HCCH Asia Pacific Week include the Meeting of the Hague International Network of Judges, a lecture by Chief Justice Diana Bryant of the Family Court of Australia on challenges in the development of international family law, as well as the Third Children's Issues Forum.",
            "The HCCH Asia Pacific Week will conclude on Saturday (November 14). For more information on its events, please visit www.hcchasiapacificweek2015.org.",

            "海牙國際私法會議亞太周由律政司及海牙國際私法會議亞太區域辦事處合辦，為期六天，將集中討論涉及兒童和家庭的跨境法律問題。",
            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師在海牙國際私法會議亞太周首項活動，「亞太區和全球追討撫養子女和家庭贍養費的國際會議」的開幕禮上致辭時表示，香港特別行政區非常重視家庭法和保護兒童。",
            "他說：「我們歡迎與其他司法管轄區交換意見和建立網絡的機會，以確保我們的相關法律制度可在跨境層面有效地運作。」",
            "他讚揚海牙國際私法會議亞太區域辦事處自二○一二年在香港特區正式成立後，不斷致力在國際家庭法範疇建立區域持份者網絡，並表示會繼續支持區域辦事處在家庭法和其他範疇的工作。",
            "袁國強表示，跨境追討供養子女和其他形式的家庭贍養費在最少兩方面具重要性。",
            "他說：「首先，兒童應受到保護，確保兒童的權益得到適當的保護是非常重要的。雖然其他的保護方式並非不重要，但法律制度往往擔當最終保護者的角色。因此，一個能促進有效和快速地追討撫養子女和其他形式家庭贍養費的強大國際網絡，無疑是保護兒童的一個重要方式。」",
            "「第二，我們經常談及境內層面的法治。事實上，聯合國有關『兒童公義』的宗旨是『兒童被國家法律、社會福利、司法制度及保障機構對待的方式，是達致法治及其相關目標不可或缺的部分。』但是，被廣泛重視的法治同時亦有其國際層面。隨全球化及區域融合，這層面的重要性與日俱增。一個能促進快速確認和執行贍養費決定的跨境網絡絕對有助在國際層面維護法治。」",
            "他補充說，不同的司法管轄區就追討撫養子女和其他形式家庭贍養費的國家和區域制度有顯著不同。二○○七年海牙兒童撫養公約和議定書的目的，就是透過簽約國之間建立一個有效率的合作系統和提供全面的應用方法，從而確保可以有效地進行跨國追討有關贍養費。",
            "海牙國際私法會議亞太周的其他主要活動包括海牙國際網絡法官會議、由澳洲家事法院首席法官Diana Bryant主講以國際家庭法發展中的挑戰為題的講座，以及第三屆兒童問題論壇。",
