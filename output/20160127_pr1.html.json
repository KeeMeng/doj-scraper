            "The investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) against Mr Tong Hin-ming Timothy (Mr Tong), former Commissioner of the ICAC, has attracted substantial public interest. Having considered the nature of the case and all the relevant circumstances including the public interest involved, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has decided to issue this Statement to summarise the main reasons why it has decided not to initiate criminal proceedings against Mr Tong. The scope of the investigation has been wide, the amount of materials voluminous, and the number of transactions involved significant. The DoJ emphasises that the reasons outlined below are only the main ones. Any matter not mentioned below does not mean that they have not been considered.",
            "The DoJ's decision",
            "In April 2013, the ICAC received complaints against Mr Tong. On May 14, 2013, the ICAC established a Special Investigation Unit to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the complaints made against Mr Tong. After having obtained the investigation report and the relevant materials from the ICAC, the DoJ has carefully considered the case and has also instructed a leading overseas Queen's Counsel (Mr Jonathan Caplan QC) to provide an independent legal opinion as to whether it is appropriate to commence criminal prosecution against Mr Tong.",
            "The Queen's Counsel submitted his final advice to the DoJ on around October 9, 2015. He advised that there was no sufficient evidence to support a prosecution against Mr Tong, whether for the offence of misconduct in public office (MIPO) or any other criminal offence.",
            "Having carefully considered the applicable law, the available evidence and also the legal advice given by the Queen's Counsel, the DoJ concluded that even though some of Mr Tong's conduct might be perceived to have fallen short of public expectation, there is no reasonable prospect of securing a conviction against Mr Tong for any criminal offence.",
            "Prosecution criteria",
            "According to the Prosecution Code, a prosecutor must consider two issues in deciding whether to prosecute. First, whether there is in law sufficient evidence to support a prosecution. Second, if there is sufficient evidence, whether the public interest requires a prosecution to be pursued.",
            "A prosecution should not be started or continued unless the prosecutor is satisfied that there is in law sufficient evidence to support a prosecution: that is, evidence that is admissible and reliable and, together with any reasonable inference able to be drawn from it, likely to prove the offence. The test is whether there is a reasonable prospect of a conviction.",
            "In the present case, the decision not to prosecute Mr Tong is solely based upon insufficiency of evidence.",
            "The relevant offences",
            "Various relevant offences have been considered in this case. These include the common law offences of MIPO and conspiracy to defraud, \"soliciting or accepting an advantage\" under sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, Cap. 201 (POBO) and \"offering an advantage to an agent\" under section 9 of POBO, \"fraud\" under section 16A of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210 and \"the making of false statements on oath\" under section 32 of Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 200.",
            "As will be explained below, MIPO is the offence which is most relevant in this case. The elements of MIPO are: (a) a public official; (b) in the course of or in relation to his public office; (c) wilfully misconducts himself; by act or omission, for example by wilfully neglecting or failing to perform his duty; (d) without reasonable excuse or justification; and (e) where such misconduct is serious, not trivial, having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities. See HKSAR v SIN Kam-wah [2005] 8 HKCFAR 192, in which the Court of Final Appeal also explained \"the misconduct must be deliberate rather than accidental in the sense that the official either knew his conduct was unlawful or wilfully disregarded the risk that his conduct was unlawful. Wilful misconduct which is without reasonable excuse or justification is culpable\".",
            "The standard for culpability for the offence of MIPO is a high one. Mistakes or negligence do not suffice; nor do errors of judgment - see Borron 1820 3 B & Ald 432; R v Boulanger [2006] 2 SCR 49, R v Chapman and others [2015] 2 Cr App R 10 and AG's Reference (No.3 of 2003) [2004] EWCA Crim 868.",
            "The areas of concern",
            "The main areas which the DoJ and the Queen's Counsel have considered in this case include: (1) entertainment activities paid out of public funds; (2) overseas duty visits; (3) his acceptance of gifts and souvenirs; (4) his offering of gifts and souvenirs; (5) the employment of a Mainland academic; and (6) whether there was any making of false statements on oath.",
            "Main area (1) - Entertainment activities hosted by Mr Tong and paid out of public funds",
            "In this regard, consideration has been given as to (a) whether any meals or entertainments were offered by Mr Tong for corrupt purposes; (b) whether the actual cost of meals was deliberately concealed; and (c) whether public funds were used improperly.",
            "In respect of (a) above:",
            "* Among others, there are complaints that Mr Tong's appointment as a member of the 12th National Committee (NC) of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in February 2013 was related to some of the meals hosted by him as a \"deferred benefit\" (延後利益). The Queen's Counsel advises and the DoJ agrees that there was no sufficient evidence to establish such a relation, or that any of the meals were offered for corrupt purposes.",
            "* The relevant Civil Service Regulations (CSRs) have also been carefully considered (Note 1). The meaning of \"making or maintaining contacts\" could be subject to different interpretation. Those Regulations left with Heads of Department room for judgment. In addition, the duties of the Commissioner of the ICAC were also wide-ranging, including those as an Executive Committee member of the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (IAACA) (Note 2). Hence, to prove that an entertainment was not a necessary part of \"making or maintaining contacts\" would face considerable difficulty.",
            "* It is also pertinent to note that blanket permission has been given by the HKSAR Government to all directorate officers to take up unpaid work with the Central Authorities of the PRC. Hence, the appointment as members of the NC of the CPCCC has never been regarded as an advantage which requires regulation.",
            "* In the circumstances, the Queen's Counsel has advised and the DoJ agrees that there is no sufficient evidence to establish wilful misconduct by Mr Tong for the purpose of establishing MIPO or any other criminal offences.",
            "In respect of (b) above, the Queen's Counsel has concluded and the DoJ agrees that there was no cogent evidence to establish that Mr Tong had sought to dishonestly conceal the actual cost of entertainments by not including the cost of separately purchased wine or liquor. It is unfortunate that the relevant rules and regulations in this regard at the time were not clear (Note 3). Importantly, according to the then Commission Standing Orders of the ICAC, Mr Tong as the Commissioner in fact had the discretion to authorise entertainment expenses above the prescribed ceilings per head. The evidence is also insufficient to prove that the attention of Mr Tong had been drawn to the fact that the spending ceiling would have been exceeded had the cost of alcoholic beverages procured separately been included. In light of the above, the available evidence is considered not sufficient to show that Mr Tong had wilfully misconducted himself and/or was otherwise dishonest. In other words, there is insufficient evidence to prove the offences of MIPO, fraud or conspiracy to defraud.",
            "In respect of (c) above, there were complaints that (i) by virtue of the presence of guests who were friends and relatives of Mr Tong, meals not related to the work of the ICAC were paid out of public funds; (ii) a portion of the meals exceeded the expenditure ceiling; and (iii) a substantial sum was spent on hard liquor. The questions that have been considered included whether each of these matters or the combination of them would in law constitute the offence of MIPO.",
            "The Queen's Counsel points out that MIPO requires a clear demarcation between conduct which is deservedly labelled as criminal and conduct which is a breach of discipline or of regulations simpliciter. He is of the view that none of the matters stated in the preceding paragraph or the combination of them constitutes the offence of MIPO.",
            "First, according to the CSRs as interpreted by the relevant authority, that some or all of the guests were friends or relatives of the officer acting as host of the entertainment should not be the determining factor in deciding whether the expenditure concerned could be charged to public funds. The important question remained whether CSR750(1) and (2) could be satisfied. Having considered all the circumstances, including the identity of the guests, their relationships with Mr Tong, the nature of the gathering and the relevant rules and regulations, the Queen's Counsel is of the view, which the DoJ agrees, that there is insufficient evidence to prove that Mr Tong deliberately chose to breach the rules by inviting guests who are his friends or relatives to some of those entertainments. The Queen's Counsel further advises that even if their presence had, in fact, been a deliberate breach, that would in law only have amounted to a breach of CSRs as opposed to the criminal law because it would not in the circumstances of this case constitute sufficiently serious conduct for the purpose of MIPO.",
            "Second, while a portion of the official entertainment activities hosted by Mr Tong exceeded the expenditure ceiling, the Queen's Counsel is of the view that no MIPO charges could be preferred. This is particularly so in view of the fact that Mr Tong, as the Head of Department, had the discretion to authorise expenditure above the limits per head and that there is no cogent evidence that he was acting corruptly for his own advantage. Having considered the relevant factors including the number of meals which exceeded the expenditure ceilings, the amount in excess, the justifications given for the expenditure incurred and whether the hospitality offered was proportionate to the occasion bearing in mind the status of the guests, the DoJ agrees with the Queen's Counsel that no MIPO charges could be preferred in this regard.",
            "Third, as regards the purchase of hard liquor, it is noted that there were neither regulations nor internal rules within the ICAC prohibiting the consumption or purchase of hard liquor including Maotai during Mr Tong's tenure as Commissioner of the ICAC. It is also noted that even before his tenure, there had been occasions of serving hard liquor at official functions. The Queen's Counsel has concluded and the DoJ agrees that there is insufficient evidence of wilful misconduct.",
            "Main area (2) - Overseas duty visits undertaken by Mr Tong",
            "In this regard, consideration has been given as to (a) whether during his tenure as Commissioner of the ICAC, Mr Tong had deliberately concealed mileage points that he had received as a result of overseas duty visits; and (b) whether the sightseeing activities in some of the duty visits were excessive.",
            "In respect of (a) above, the Queen's Counsel takes the view that there is no realistic prospect of proving Mr Tong practised deceit with intent to defraud after taking into account the facts that (i) when Mr Tong assumed office, he did report the mileage credits which he had earned from duty visits when he was the Commissioner of Customs and Excise; (ii) he had granted to other ICAC officers the right to access his mileage points account; and (iii) the report of mileage points earned by Mr Tong was prepared by his subordinate officers. There is therefore insufficient evidence to prove the offence of fraud or other criminal offence. The DoJ agrees with the view of the Queen's Counsel.",
            "Regarding (b) above, the evidence shows that the sightseeing activities were mainly decided by the hosts and the details were only made known to the ICAC very shortly before or even during the visits. The Queen's Counsel considers and the DoJ agrees that there is not sufficient evidence to establish there was any misconduct by Mr Tong.",
            "Main area (3) - Acceptance of gifts and souvenirs by Mr Tong",
            "Mr Tong has retained some gifts and souvenirs received by him in his capacity as the Commissioner of the ICAC. At the material time, he had a blanket permission to personally retain any gift with an estimated value of below 0.1 per cent of his salary (about HK$200) or, in respect of any gift which was personally inscribed with his name or received by him at official functions as the guest of honour/officiating guest, below HK$400. The DoJ has seen no evidence of any under-valuation of gifts. Further, taking into account the estimated value of the gifts involved, the occasions when the gifts were presented, the state of record of the circumstances under which the gifts were presented, and the absence of any evidence showing corrupt motive, the Queen's Counsel advises and the DoJ agrees that there is no sufficient evidence of any criminal conduct in this regard.",
            "Main area (4) - Offering of gifts and souvenirs by Mr Tong",
            "There are two relevant aspects: (a) whether the evidence is sufficient to substantiate any offence under the POBO (and in particular section 9(2)), and (b) whether the evidence is sufficient to substantiate any offence of MIPO.",
            "In respect of (a) above, consideration has been given as to whether Mr Tong had offered gifts to Mainland officials and/or other persons for corrupt purposes. The Queen's Counsel takes the view, and the DOJ agrees, that there was none. Despite the personal nature of some of the gifts, there is simply no evidence to show that those gifts were offered as an inducement to or reward for or otherwise on account of the recipients doing or not doing anything as proscribed by section 9(2). Nor can any corrupt purposes be inferred in the circumstances.",
            "In respect of (b) above, the ICAC Standing Orders state that the ICAC's policy is to limit the exchange of gifts on official occasions to a minimum and to exchange only on organisation to organisation level rather than on a personal basis. However, there was no CSR or guideline at the time governing the amount of spending on gifts by the Commissioner of the ICAC at official functions. Mr Tong, as the head of the ICAC and controlling officer designated under the Public Finance Ordinance, Cap. 2, was entrusted with discretionary powers in incurring expenditure. In the circumstances, whilst some of the gifts appear to be personal in nature and inappropriate, the Queen's Counsel concludes, and the DoJ agrees, that there was insufficient evidence of wilful misconduct in the context of the offence of MIPO.",
            "Area (5) - Employment of a Mainland academic",
            "The allegation is that Mr Tong circumvented established procedures to employ a Mainland academic in September 2010 for the Centre of Anti-Corruption Studies (a research institute set up by the ICAC in 2009). According to the applicable guidelines, Mr Tong, as the Head of Department, had the full authority and discretion to decide on the employment of staff under the Non-Civil Service Contract scheme. Besides, there is no evidence that the appointment of the academic was motivated by any corrupt purpose. Nor is there any evidence to suggest that Mr Tong derived any direct or indirect benefit from the employment of the academic in question. The Queen's Counsel concludes that there is no evidence in support of any criminal charge, a conclusion the DoJ agrees with.",
            "Area (6) - Making of false statements on oath",
            "Consideration has been given as to whether Mr Tong had made false statements on oath at the Legislative Council Public Accounts Committee hearings. Taking into account all the relevant circumstances, including the lapse of time between the relevant events, the Queen's Counsel takes the view that there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Tong wilfully made false statements on oath and that he knew or believed the statements were false. Accordingly, the Queen's Counsel concludes and the DoJ agrees that there is insufficient evidence to support any criminal charge in this regard.",
            "Conclusion",
            "When considering whether any offence was committed in this case, it is important to take into account all the relevant circumstances surrounding the alleged misconduct as well as the intricacies and inadequacies of the governing rules and regulations applicable at the time. We can well understand that some of Mr Tong's conducts under investigation might attract suspicions or even criticisms. However, the role of the Prosecutions Division of the DoJ is to decide whether criminal prosecution should be commenced in accordance with the Prosecution Code; besides, a prosecution may only ever be instituted on the basis of sufficiency of evidence. Accordingly, the fact that the DoJ decides not to commence prosecution on the ground of insufficiency of evidence should not be interpreted as an endorsement of Mr Tong's conduct or any part thereof.",
            "Note 1: In particular, CSR750(1) and (2) provides that \"Heads of Department and officers duly authorised by their Head of Department may be reimbursed expenses arising from entertainment undertaken in the course of duty\", and \"Expenditure on entertainment may be charged to public funds when it is (a) directly related to the discharge of an officer's duties or a necessary part of making or maintaining contacts in his official capacity; and (b) in the public interest.\"",
            "Note 2: The IAACA was established in 2006 and aims to strengthen international co-operation in anti-corruption matters, and the head of the ICAC was appointed as an Executive Committee member of the IAACA in 2008.",
            "Note 3: The CSRs did not specify whether the expenses of wines or liquor separately purchased for an official entertainment should be reported in the claim of entertainment expenses and counted towards the ceiling for calculating expenditure per head. The then prevailing practice was that it would be up to the Head of Department to decide. Further, the then internal Commission Standing Orders of the ICAC contained no express provision requiring the expenses of wines or liquor separately purchased to be included for the purpose of calculating the ceilings.",

            "廉政公署（廉署）調查前廉政專員湯顯明一事引起公眾高度關注。在考慮事件的性質、所有相關情況及公眾利益後，律政司發表以下聲明，簡述決定不對湯顯明提出刑事檢控的主要原因。由於有關調查的範圍廣泛、資料繁多，而且涉及大量事項，律政司強調下文只概括介紹當中的主要原因。下文未提及之事宜，並不代表該等事宜未被考慮。",
            "廉署於2013年4月收到有關湯顯明的投訴，於2013年5月14日成立專責調查小組就投訴內容展開全面調查。在收到廉署的調查報告及相關資料後，律政司對案件進行研究，並委託海外御用大律師（Jonathan Caplan QC）就應否向湯顯明提出檢控提供獨立法律意見。",
            "2015年10月9日，御用大律師向律政司提交最終意見書。他認為不論是就「公職人員行為失當」或任何其他罪行，在法律上均未有充分證據向湯顯明提出刑事檢控。",
            "律政司在小心考慮適用法律、現有證據和御用大律師的法律意見後作出結論，認為雖然湯顯明的某些行為可被視為未能符合公眾期望，但若提出刑事檢控，則並無合理機會可達致湯顯明被定罪的結果。",
            "根據《檢控守則》，檢控人員在決定應否提出檢控時須考慮兩大問題：第一，是否在法律上有充分證據支持提出檢控？第二，若有充分證據，進行檢控是否符合公眾利益？",
            "除非檢控人員信納在法律上有充分證據支持提出檢控，即這些可接納和可靠的證據，連同可從相關證據作出的合理推論，有相當機會能證明有關罪行，否則不應提出或繼續進行檢控。而驗證標準則為是否有合理機會達致定罪。就本案而言，不對湯顯明提出檢控的決定完全是建基於證據不足的考慮。",
            "律政司在處理本案時，曾經考慮過多項可能相關的控罪，包括普通法下的「公職人員行為失當」和「串謀詐騙」、香港法例第201章《防止賄賂條例》第3、4條的「索取或接受利益」和第9條的「向代理人提供利益」、第210章《盜竊罪條例》第16A條的「欺詐罪」，以及第200章《刑事罪行條例》第32條的「經宣誓後作出虛假陳述」。",
            "如下文解說，本案最關鍵的罪行是「公職人員行為失當」。「公職人員行為失當」的元素為：（a）公職人員；（b）在擔任公職期間或在與擔任公職有關的情況下；（c）藉作為或不作為而故意作出失當行為，例如故意疏忽職守或沒有履行職責；（d）無合理辯解或理由；以及（e）考慮到有關公職和任職者的責任、他們所尋求達致的公共目標的重要性及偏離責任的性質和程度，有關的失當行為屬於嚴重而非微不足道。參閱香港特別行政區訴冼錦華 [2005] 8 HKCFAR 192。在該案中，終審法院亦解釋：「失當行為必須是蓄意作出而非意外地引起，意思是有關人員知悉其行為不合法或故意地無視其行為可能不合法。在缺乏合理辯解或理由下故意作出的失當行為，將構成罪行。」「公職人員行為失當罪」的刑責基準是高的。錯誤或疏忽並不足夠，判斷出錯亦然。參見Borron 1820 3 B & Ald 432；R v Boulanger [2006] 2 SCR 49；R v Chapman and others [2015] 2 Cr App R 10；以及AG's Reference（No.3 of 2003）[2004] EWCA Crim 868。",
            "律政司與御用大律師在本案中所考慮的主要範疇包括：（1）以公帑提供款待；（2）公務外訪；（3）收受禮物和紀念品；（4）餽贈禮物和紀念品；（5）聘請一名內地學者；以及（6）有否在宣誓後作虛假陳述。",
            "在這方面曾考慮的問題為（a）湯顯明提供膳食或款待是否出於賄賂的目的；（b）膳食的實際開支有否被蓄意隱瞞；以及（c）當中有否涉及不當使用公帑。",
            "在這方面曾考慮的問題為（a）湯顯明提供膳食或款待是否出於賄賂的目的；（b）膳食的實際開支有否被蓄意隱瞞；以及（c）當中有否涉及不當使用公帑。",
            "＊當中有投訴指湯顯明於2013年2月獲委任為第12屆中國人民政治協商會議全國委員會（全國政協）委員，是與他數次做東宴客有關的「延後利益」。御用大律師認為沒有充分證據證明兩者之間存在這種關係，或任何一次宴客是出於賄賂的目的。律政司同意御用大律師的結論。",
            "＊我們亦仔細考慮相關《公務員事務規例》（《規例》）的條文（註一）。當中例如「聯絡」或「保持聯絡」等相關字句可有不同的演繹。該規例亦存在空間，令部門主管能自行作出判斷。此外，廉政專員的職務繁多，當中包括作為國際反貪局聯合會（聯合會）（註二）執行委員的相關職務。因此，要證明酬酢並非「聯絡有關人士或與他們保持聯絡」的必需開支存在一定困難。",
            "＊亦值得留意的是，所有首長級人員一律獲香港特區政府批准從事由中華人民共和國中央當局委派的無薪工作。因此，接受委任為全國政協委員從來不被視為一項須受規管的收受利益行為。",
            "＊在此情況下，律政司同意御用大律師的意見，認為沒有足夠證據證明湯顯明曾故意作出失當行為或其他刑事罪行。",
            "就上述（b）項，律政司同意御用大律師的結論，即沒有足夠證據可以證明湯顯明曾以分開購買餐酒或烈酒費用的方法，試圖不誠實地隱瞞實際的酬酢開支。不幸的是，當時有關這方面的相關規則與規例並不清晰（註三）。當中尤為重要的是，根據當時的《廉政公署常規》，湯顯明作為廉政專員，有權酌情批准超出訂明人均上限的酬酢開支。此外，有關證據亦不足以證明有人曾向湯顯明指出，若把分開購買酒水的費用計算在內，便會超出開支上限。基於上述情況，現有證據並不足以顯示湯顯明曾故意作出不當行為或有不誠實之舉。換言之，沒有充分證據證明「公職人員行為失當」、「欺詐」或「串謀詐騙」等罪行。",
            "就上述（c）項，有投訴指（i）以公帑支付一些有湯顯明的親友參與而與廉署公務無關的膳食款待；（ii）部分膳食款待費用超出了人均開支上限；以及（iii）有大筆款項用於購買烈酒。我們亦曾考慮上述每項個別事件和上述各項事件綜合起來會否在法律上構成「公職人員行為失當罪」。",
            "御用大律師指出，就「公職人員行為失當罪」而言，必須清楚區分刑事罪行和純屬違紀違規的行為。他認為上一段所述的任何一項或各項綜合起來均不構成「公職人員行為失當罪」。",
            "第一，根據有關部門對《規例》的釋義，酬酢活動中有部分或全部賓客是作為東道主人員的親友，不應是決定相關開支是否可以公帑支付的主要因素。關鍵的問題仍在於是否符合《規例》第750（1）及（2）條所列的情況。御用大律師在考慮過所有因素，包括賓客身分、他們與湯顯明的關係、聚會的性質和相關的規則與規例後，認為沒有充分證據證明湯顯明蓄意違規，在部分酬酢活動中邀請其親友作為客人。對此，律政司亦持相同意見。此外，御用大律師亦認為，即使安排他們出席有關活動確實是蓄意違規的行為，在法律上也只是觸犯《規例》而非觸犯刑法，因為以其嚴重程度來說，並不足以構成「公職人員行為失當罪」。",
            "第二，儘管部分由湯顯明做東的官方酬酢活動超出開支上限，御用大律師認為不能為此以「公職人員行為失當」的罪名提出檢控。重要的考慮是湯顯明作為部門首長，有權酌情批准超出人均上限的開支，亦沒有足夠證據證明他是為了一己私利而作出舞弊行為。考慮過膳食開支超出上限的次數、超出的金額、就有關開支提出的理由，以及提供的招待是否切合有關場合和賓客身分的相關因素之後，律政司同意不能在這方面以「公職人員行為失當」的罪名提出檢控。",
            "第三，有關購買烈酒一事，值得注意的是湯顯明任職廉政專員期間，並無任何規例或廉署內部規則禁止飲用或購買包括茅台等烈酒。此外，在湯顯明上任之前，廉署也曾有在官方場合以烈酒奉客的先例。律政司同意御用大律師的結論，認為沒有充分證據證明湯顯明曾故意作出不當行為。",
            "在這方面經考慮的問題包括（a）湯顯明任職廉政專員期間曾否蓄意隱瞞他因公務外訪而賺取的飛行里數；以及（b）部分的公務外訪是否涉及過多的觀光活動。",
            "就上述（a）項，御用大律師認為實際上不可能證明湯顯明曾以欺詐手段意圖詐騙，這是因為考慮到（i）湯顯明在上任時也曾申報他在任職海關關長期間因公務外訪而賺取的飛行里數；（ii）他批准其他廉署人員查閱其飛行里數帳戶；以及（iii）有關湯顯明賺取飛行里數的申報是由其屬下人員所處理的。因此，本案並無充分證據證實涉及「欺詐罪」。律政司同意御用大律師以上觀點。",
            "就上述（b）項，有關證據顯示涉及的觀光活動主要是由相關東道主決定，而且廉署只是在外訪前不久或甚是在外訪期間才獲悉相關細節。御用大律師認為沒有充分證據證明湯顯明曾作出不當行為，而律政司亦同意其看法。",
            "湯顯明保留了部分他以廉政專員身分收受的禮物和紀念品。在相關時段，凡估計價值低於其薪酬百分之0.1（即約港幣200元）的禮物，或是刻有其姓名或他以貴賓或主禮嘉賓身分出席官方場合時所收而估計價值低於港幣400元的禮物，他均一律獲准以個人身分保留。律政司並無發現有低估禮物價值的證據。再者，考慮到所涉禮物的估計價值、送禮場合和有關送禮情況的記錄，再加上沒有證據顯示存在任何賄賂動機，御用大律師認為在這方面沒有充分證據證明任何刑事罪行，而律政司亦同意其看法。",
            "此範疇涉及兩個相關方面：（a）有關證據是否足以證明《防止賄賂條例》（特別是第9（2）條）所訂明的任何罪行；以及（b）有關證據是否足以證實任何「公職人員行為失當」的罪行。",
            "就上述（a）項，關鍵在於湯顯明是否出於賄賂目的而向內地官員或其他人士餽贈禮物。經考慮後，御用大律師認為而律政司亦同意有關餽贈不涉及任何賄賂目的。雖然部分餽贈屬就個人作出的餽贈，但並沒有證據顯示餽贈有關禮物是要對方作出或不作出任何第9（2）條中所訂明的行為的誘因或報酬，亦不能作出貪污意圖的推論。",
            "就上述（b）項，《廉政公署常規》訂明廉署的政策，即官方場合互相餽贈禮物應可免則免，並應限於機構之間的餽贈而不應就個人作出餽贈。然而，當時的《規例》或其他指引均沒有管限廉政專員在官方場合餽贈禮物的可用金額。身為廉署的首長以及香港法例第2章《公務財政條例》所指明的管制人員，湯顯明先生獲授權管制開支。在這情況下，雖然部分禮物餽贈表面上看來是就個人作出的餽贈而且並不恰當，但御用大律師的結論是沒有足夠證據支持事件涉及「公職人員行為失當」罪行中的故意不當行為，律政司亦同意有關結論。",

            "至於湯顯明有否在立法會帳目委員會舉行聆訊時作出虛假陳述，經考慮所有相關情況，包括相關事件發生已有一段時間，御用大律師認為沒有足夠證據顯示湯顯明在宣誓後故意作出他知道或相信為虛假的陳述。因此，御用大律師的結論是沒有足夠證據支持提出任何刑事檢控，而律政司亦同意有關結論。",
            "在查究這宗案件是否涉及犯罪行為時，重點是要考慮涉案被指不當行為的所有相關情況，以及當時適用的相關管限規則和規定的複雜性與不足之處。我們明白湯顯明被調查的某些行為可能帶來質疑甚或批評。然而，律政司刑事檢控科的職責，是依據《檢控守則》決定應否提出檢控；此外，檢控只能在有充分證據的基礎時才能提出。因此，今次律政司基於沒有充分證據的考慮決定不作出檢控，不應被理解為律政司認同湯顯明的行為或當中任何部分。",

            "The investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) against Mr Tong Hin-ming Timothy (Mr Tong), former Commissioner of the ICAC, has attracted substantial public interest",
            "Having considered the nature of the case and all the relevant circumstances including the public interest involved, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has decided to issue this Statement to summarise the main reasons why it has decided not to initiate criminal proceedings against Mr Tong",
            "The scope of the investigation has been wide, the amount of materials voluminous, and the number of transactions involved significant",
            "The DoJ emphasises that the reasons outlined below are only the main ones",
            "Any matter not mentioned below does not mean that they have not been considered.",
            "The DoJ's decision",
            "In April 2013, the ICAC received complaints against Mr Tong",
            "On May 14, 2013, the ICAC established a Special Investigation Unit to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the complaints made against Mr Tong",
            "After having obtained the investigation report and the relevant materials from the ICAC, the DoJ has carefully considered the case and has also instructed a leading overseas Queen's Counsel (Mr Jonathan Caplan QC) to provide an independent legal opinion as to whether it is appropriate to commence criminal prosecution against Mr Tong.",
            "The Queen's Counsel submitted his final advice to the DoJ on around October 9, 2015",
            "He advised that there was no sufficient evidence to support a prosecution against Mr Tong, whether for the offence of misconduct in public office (MIPO) or any other criminal offence.",
            "Having carefully considered the applicable law, the available evidence and also the legal advice given by the Queen's Counsel, the DoJ concluded that even though some of Mr Tong's conduct might be perceived to have fallen short of public expectation, there is no reasonable prospect of securing a conviction against Mr Tong for any criminal offence.",
            "Prosecution criteria",
            "According to the Prosecution Code, a prosecutor must consider two issues in deciding whether to prosecute",
            "First, whether there is in law sufficient evidence to support a prosecution",
            "Second, if there is sufficient evidence, whether the public interest requires a prosecution to be pursued.",
            "A prosecution should not be started or continued unless the prosecutor is satisfied that there is in law sufficient evidence to support a prosecution: that is, evidence that is admissible and reliable and, together with any reasonable inference able to be drawn from it, likely to prove the offence",
            "The test is whether there is a reasonable prospect of a conviction.",
            "In the present case, the decision not to prosecute Mr Tong is solely based upon insufficiency of evidence.",
            "The relevant offences",
            "Various relevant offences have been considered in this case",
            "These include the common law offences of MIPO and conspiracy to defraud, \"soliciting or accepting an advantage\" under sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, Cap",
            "201 (POBO) and \"offering an advantage to an agent\" under section 9 of POBO, \"fraud\" under section 16A of the Theft Ordinance, Cap",
            "210 and \"the making of false statements on oath\" under section 32 of Crimes Ordinance, Cap",
            "As will be explained below, MIPO is the offence which is most relevant in this case",
            "The elements of MIPO are: (a) a public official; (b) in the course of or in relation to his public office; (c) wilfully misconducts himself; by act or omission, for example by wilfully neglecting or failing to perform his duty; (d) without reasonable excuse or justification; and (e) where such misconduct is serious, not trivial, having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities",
            "See HKSAR v SIN Kam-wah [2005] 8 HKCFAR 192, in which the Court of Final Appeal also explained \"the misconduct must be deliberate rather than accidental in the sense that the official either knew his conduct was unlawful or wilfully disregarded the risk that his conduct was unlawful",
            "Wilful misconduct which is without reasonable excuse or justification is culpable\".",
            "The standard for culpability for the offence of MIPO is a high one",
            "Mistakes or negligence do not suffice; nor do errors of judgment - see Borron 1820 3 B & Ald 432; R v Boulanger [2006] 2 SCR 49, R v Chapman and others [2015] 2 Cr App R 10 and AG's Reference (No.3 of 2003) [2004] EWCA Crim 868.",
            "The areas of concern",
            "The main areas which the DoJ and the Queen's Counsel have considered in this case include: (1) entertainment activities paid out of public funds; (2) overseas duty visits; (3) his acceptance of gifts and souvenirs; (4) his offering of gifts and souvenirs; (5) the employment of a Mainland academic; and (6) whether there was any making of false statements on oath.",
            "Main area (1) - Entertainment activities hosted by Mr Tong and paid out of public funds",
            "In this regard, consideration has been given as to (a) whether any meals or entertainments were offered by Mr Tong for corrupt purposes; (b) whether the actual cost of meals was deliberately concealed; and (c) whether public funds were used improperly.",
            "In respect of (a) above:",
            "The Queen's Counsel advises and the DoJ agrees that there was no sufficient evidence to establish such a relation, or that any of the meals were offered for corrupt purposes.",
            "* The relevant Civil Service Regulations (CSRs) have also been carefully considered (Note 1)",
            "The meaning of \"making or maintaining contacts\" could be subject to different interpretation",
            "Those Regulations left with Heads of Department room for judgment",
            "In addition, the duties of the Commissioner of the ICAC were also wide-ranging, including those as an Executive Committee member of the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (IAACA) (Note 2)",
            "Hence, to prove that an entertainment was not a necessary part of \"making or maintaining contacts\" would face considerable difficulty.",
            "* It is also pertinent to note that blanket permission has been given by the HKSAR Government to all directorate officers to take up unpaid work with the Central Authorities of the PRC",
            "Hence, the appointment as members of the NC of the CPCCC has never been regarded as an advantage which requires regulation.",
            "* In the circumstances, the Queen's Counsel has advised and the DoJ agrees that there is no sufficient evidence to establish wilful misconduct by Mr Tong for the purpose of establishing MIPO or any other criminal offences.",
            "In respect of (b) above, the Queen's Counsel has concluded and the DoJ agrees that there was no cogent evidence to establish that Mr Tong had sought to dishonestly conceal the actual cost of entertainments by not including the cost of separately purchased wine or liquor",
            "It is unfortunate that the relevant rules and regulations in this regard at the time were not clear (Note 3)",
            "Importantly, according to the then Commission Standing Orders of the ICAC, Mr Tong as the Commissioner in fact had the discretion to authorise entertainment expenses above the prescribed ceilings per head",
            "The evidence is also insufficient to prove that the attention of Mr Tong had been drawn to the fact that the spending ceiling would have been exceeded had the cost of alcoholic beverages procured separately been included",
            "In light of the above, the available evidence is considered not sufficient to show that Mr Tong had wilfully misconducted himself and/or was otherwise dishonest",
            "In other words, there is insufficient evidence to prove the offences of MIPO, fraud or conspiracy to defraud.",
            "In respect of (c) above, there were complaints that (i) by virtue of the presence of guests who were friends and relatives of Mr Tong, meals not related to the work of the ICAC were paid out of public funds; (ii) a portion of the meals exceeded the expenditure ceiling; and (iii) a substantial sum was spent on hard liquor",
            "The questions that have been considered included whether each of these matters or the combination of them would in law constitute the offence of MIPO.",
            "The Queen's Counsel points out that MIPO requires a clear demarcation between conduct which is deservedly labelled as criminal and conduct which is a breach of discipline or of regulations simpliciter",
            "He is of the view that none of the matters stated in the preceding paragraph or the combination of them constitutes the offence of MIPO.",
            "First, according to the CSRs as interpreted by the relevant authority, that some or all of the guests were friends or relatives of the officer acting as host of the entertainment should not be the determining factor in deciding whether the expenditure concerned could be charged to public funds",
            "The important question remained whether CSR750(1) and (2) could be satisfied",
            "Having considered all the circumstances, including the identity of the guests, their relationships with Mr Tong, the nature of the gathering and the relevant rules and regulations, the Queen's Counsel is of the view, which the DoJ agrees, that there is insufficient evidence to prove that Mr Tong deliberately chose to breach the rules by inviting guests who are his friends or relatives to some of those entertainments",
            "The Queen's Counsel further advises that even if their presence had, in fact, been a deliberate breach, that would in law only have amounted to a breach of CSRs as opposed to the criminal law because it would not in the circumstances of this case constitute sufficiently serious conduct for the purpose of MIPO.",
            "Second, while a portion of the official entertainment activities hosted by Mr Tong exceeded the expenditure ceiling, the Queen's Counsel is of the view that no MIPO charges could be preferred",
            "This is particularly so in view of the fact that Mr Tong, as the Head of Department, had the discretion to authorise expenditure above the limits per head and that there is no cogent evidence that he was acting corruptly for his own advantage",
            "Having considered the relevant factors including the number of meals which exceeded the expenditure ceilings, the amount in excess, the justifications given for the expenditure incurred and whether the hospitality offered was proportionate to the occasion bearing in mind the status of the guests, the DoJ agrees with the Queen's Counsel that no MIPO charges could be preferred in this regard.",
            "Third, as regards the purchase of hard liquor, it is noted that there were neither regulations nor internal rules within the ICAC prohibiting the consumption or purchase of hard liquor including Maotai during Mr Tong's tenure as Commissioner of the ICAC",
            "It is also noted that even before his tenure, there had been occasions of serving hard liquor at official functions",
            "The Queen's Counsel has concluded and the DoJ agrees that there is insufficient evidence of wilful misconduct.",
            "Main area (2) - Overseas duty visits undertaken by Mr Tong",
            "In this regard, consideration has been given as to (a) whether during his tenure as Commissioner of the ICAC, Mr Tong had deliberately concealed mileage points that he had received as a result of overseas duty visits; and (b) whether the sightseeing activities in some of the duty visits were excessive.",
            "In respect of (a) above, the Queen's Counsel takes the view that there is no realistic prospect of proving Mr Tong practised deceit with intent to defraud after taking into account the facts that (i) when Mr Tong assumed office, he did report the mileage credits which he had earned from duty visits when he was the Commissioner of Customs and Excise; (ii) he had granted to other ICAC officers the right to access his mileage points account; and (iii) the report of mileage points earned by Mr Tong was prepared by his subordinate officers",
            "There is therefore insufficient evidence to prove the offence of fraud or other criminal offence",
            "The DoJ agrees with the view of the Queen's Counsel.",
            "Regarding (b) above, the evidence shows that the sightseeing activities were mainly decided by the hosts and the details were only made known to the ICAC very shortly before or even during the visits",
            "The Queen's Counsel considers and the DoJ agrees that there is not sufficient evidence to establish there was any misconduct by Mr Tong.",
            "Main area (3) - Acceptance of gifts and souvenirs by Mr Tong",
            "Mr Tong has retained some gifts and souvenirs received by him in his capacity as the Commissioner of the ICAC",
            "At the material time, he had a blanket permission to personally retain any gift with an estimated value of below 0.1 per cent of his salary (about HK$200) or, in respect of any gift which was personally inscribed with his name or received by him at official functions as the guest of honour/officiating guest, below HK$400",
            "The DoJ has seen no evidence of any under-valuation of gifts",
            "Further, taking into account the estimated value of the gifts involved, the occasions when the gifts were presented, the state of record of the circumstances under which the gifts were presented, and the absence of any evidence showing corrupt motive, the Queen's Counsel advises and the DoJ agrees that there is no sufficient evidence of any criminal conduct in this regard.",
            "Main area (4) - Offering of gifts and souvenirs by Mr Tong",
            "There are two relevant aspects: (a) whether the evidence is sufficient to substantiate any offence under the POBO (and in particular section 9(2)), and (b) whether the evidence is sufficient to substantiate any offence of MIPO.",
            "In respect of (a) above, consideration has been given as to whether Mr Tong had offered gifts to Mainland officials and/or other persons for corrupt purposes",
            "The Queen's Counsel takes the view, and the DOJ agrees, that there was none",
            "Despite the personal nature of some of the gifts, there is simply no evidence to show that those gifts were offered as an inducement to or reward for or otherwise on account of the recipients doing or not doing anything as proscribed by section 9(2)",
            "Nor can any corrupt purposes be inferred in the circumstances.",
            "In respect of (b) above, the ICAC Standing Orders state that the ICAC's policy is to limit the exchange of gifts on official occasions to a minimum and to exchange only on organisation to organisation level rather than on a personal basis",
            "However, there was no CSR or guideline at the time governing the amount of spending on gifts by the Commissioner of the ICAC at official functions",
            "Mr Tong, as the head of the ICAC and controlling officer designated under the Public Finance Ordinance, Cap",
            "2, was entrusted with discretionary powers in incurring expenditure",
            "In the circumstances, whilst some of the gifts appear to be personal in nature and inappropriate, the Queen's Counsel concludes, and the DoJ agrees, that there was insufficient evidence of wilful misconduct in the context of the offence of MIPO.",
            "Area (5) - Employment of a Mainland academic",
            "The allegation is that Mr Tong circumvented established procedures to employ a Mainland academic in September 2010 for the Centre of Anti-Corruption Studies (a research institute set up by the ICAC in 2009)",
            "According to the applicable guidelines, Mr Tong, as the Head of Department, had the full authority and discretion to decide on the employment of staff under the Non-Civil Service Contract scheme",
            "Besides, there is no evidence that the appointment of the academic was motivated by any corrupt purpose",
            "Nor is there any evidence to suggest that Mr Tong derived any direct or indirect benefit from the employment of the academic in question",
            "The Queen's Counsel concludes that there is no evidence in support of any criminal charge, a conclusion the DoJ agrees with.",
            "Area (6) - Making of false statements on oath",
            "Consideration has been given as to whether Mr Tong had made false statements on oath at the Legislative Council Public Accounts Committee hearings",
            "Taking into account all the relevant circumstances, including the lapse of time between the relevant events, the Queen's Counsel takes the view that there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Tong wilfully made false statements on oath and that he knew or believed the statements were false",
            "Accordingly, the Queen's Counsel concludes and the DoJ agrees that there is insufficient evidence to support any criminal charge in this regard.",
            "Conclusion",
            "When considering whether any offence was committed in this case, it is important to take into account all the relevant circumstances surrounding the alleged misconduct as well as the intricacies and inadequacies of the governing rules and regulations applicable at the time",
            "We can well understand that some of Mr Tong's conducts under investigation might attract suspicions or even criticisms",
            "However, the role of the Prosecutions Division of the DoJ is to decide whether criminal prosecution should be commenced in accordance with the Prosecution Code; besides, a prosecution may only ever be instituted on the basis of sufficiency of evidence",
            "Accordingly, the fact that the DoJ decides not to commence prosecution on the ground of insufficiency of evidence should not be interpreted as an endorsement of Mr Tong's conduct or any part thereof.",
            "Note 1: In particular, CSR750(1) and (2) provides that \"Heads of Department and officers duly authorised by their Head of Department may be reimbursed expenses arising from entertainment undertaken in the course of duty\", and \"Expenditure on entertainment may be charged to public funds when it is (a) directly related to the discharge of an officer's duties or a necessary part of making or maintaining contacts in his official capacity; and (b) in the public interest.\"",
            "Note 2: The IAACA was established in 2006 and aims to strengthen international co-operation in anti-corruption matters, and the head of the ICAC was appointed as an Executive Committee member of the IAACA in 2008.",
            "Note 3: The CSRs did not specify whether the expenses of wines or liquor separately purchased for an official entertainment should be reported in the claim of entertainment expenses and counted towards the ceiling for calculating expenditure per head",
            "The then prevailing practice was that it would be up to the Head of Department to decide",
            "Further, the then internal Commission Standing Orders of the ICAC contained no express provision requiring the expenses of wines or liquor separately purchased to be included for the purpose of calculating the ceilings.",

            "律政司同意御用大律師的結論",
            "＊我們亦仔細考慮相關《公務員事務規例》（《規例》）的條文（註一）",
            "當中例如「聯絡」或「保持聯絡」等相關字句可有不同的演繹",
            "該規例亦存在空間，令部門主管能自行作出判斷",
            "此外，廉政專員的職務繁多，當中包括作為國際反貪局聯合會（聯合會）（註二）執行委員的相關職務",
            "因此，要證明酬酢並非「聯絡有關人士或與他們保持聯絡」的必需開支存在一定困難",
            "＊亦值得留意的是，所有首長級人員一律獲香港特區政府批准從事由中華人民共和國中央當局委派的無薪工作",
            "因此，接受委任為全國政協委員從來不被視為一項須受規管的收受利益行為",
            "＊在此情況下，律政司同意御用大律師的意見，認為沒有足夠證據證明湯顯明曾故意作出失當行為或其他刑事罪行",
            "就上述（b）項，律政司同意御用大律師的結論，即沒有足夠證據可以證明湯顯明曾以分開購買餐酒或烈酒費用的方法，試圖不誠實地隱瞞實際的酬酢開支",
            "不幸的是，當時有關這方面的相關規則與規例並不清晰（註三）",
            "當中尤為重要的是，根據當時的《廉政公署常規》，湯顯明作為廉政專員，有權酌情批准超出訂明人均上限的酬酢開支",
            "此外，有關證據亦不足以證明有人曾向湯顯明指出，若把分開購買酒水的費用計算在內，便會超出開支上限",
            "基於上述情況，現有證據並不足以顯示湯顯明曾故意作出不當行為或有不誠實之舉",
            "換言之，沒有充分證據證明「公職人員行為失當」、「欺詐」或「串謀詐騙」等罪行",
            "我們亦曾考慮上述每項個別事件和上述各項事件綜合起來會否在法律上構成「公職人員行為失當罪」",
            "御用大律師指出，就「公職人員行為失當罪」而言，必須清楚區分刑事罪行和純屬違紀違規的行為",
            "他認為上一段所述的任何一項或各項綜合起來均不構成「公職人員行為失當罪」",
            "第一，根據有關部門對《規例》的釋義，酬酢活動中有部分或全部賓客是作為東道主人員的親友，不應是決定相關開支是否可以公帑支付的主要因素",
            "關鍵的問題仍在於是否符合《規例》第750（1）及（2）條所列的情況",
            "御用大律師在考慮過所有因素，包括賓客身分、他們與湯顯明的關係、聚會的性質和相關的規則與規例後，認為沒有充分證據證明湯顯明蓄意違規，在部分酬酢活動中邀請其親友作為客人",
            "對此，律政司亦持相同意見",
            "此外，御用大律師亦認為，即使安排他們出席有關活動確實是蓄意違規的行為，在法律上也只是觸犯《規例》而非觸犯刑法，因為以其嚴重程度來說，並不足以構成「公職人員行為失當罪」",
            "第二，儘管部分由湯顯明做東的官方酬酢活動超出開支上限，御用大律師認為不能為此以「公職人員行為失當」的罪名提出檢控",
            "重要的考慮是湯顯明作為部門首長，有權酌情批准超出人均上限的開支，亦沒有足夠證據證明他是為了一己私利而作出舞弊行為",
            "考慮過膳食開支超出上限的次數、超出的金額、就有關開支提出的理由，以及提供的招待是否切合有關場合和賓客身分的相關因素之後，律政司同意不能在這方面以「公職人員行為失當」的罪名提出檢控",
            "第三，有關購買烈酒一事，值得注意的是湯顯明任職廉政專員期間，並無任何規例或廉署內部規則禁止飲用或購買包括茅台等烈酒",
            "此外，在湯顯明上任之前，廉署也曾有在官方場合以烈酒奉客的先例",
            "律政司同意御用大律師的結論，認為沒有充分證據證明湯顯明曾故意作出不當行為",
            "在這方面經考慮的問題包括（a）湯顯明任職廉政專員期間曾否蓄意隱瞞他因公務外訪而賺取的飛行里數；以及（b）部分的公務外訪是否涉及過多的觀光活動",
            "就上述（a）項，御用大律師認為實際上不可能證明湯顯明曾以欺詐手段意圖詐騙，這是因為考慮到（i）湯顯明在上任時也曾申報他在任職海關關長期間因公務外訪而賺取的飛行里數；（ii）他批准其他廉署人員查閱其飛行里數帳戶；以及（iii）有關湯顯明賺取飛行里數的申報是由其屬下人員所處理的",
            "因此，本案並無充分證據證實涉及「欺詐罪」",
            "律政司同意御用大律師以上觀點",
            "就上述（b）項，有關證據顯示涉及的觀光活動主要是由相關東道主決定，而且廉署只是在外訪前不久或甚是在外訪期間才獲悉相關細節",
            "御用大律師認為沒有充分證據證明湯顯明曾作出不當行為，而律政司亦同意其看法",
            "湯顯明保留了部分他以廉政專員身分收受的禮物和紀念品",
            "在相關時段，凡估計價值低於其薪酬百分之0.1（即約港幣200元）的禮物，或是刻有其姓名或他以貴賓或主禮嘉賓身分出席官方場合時所收而估計價值低於港幣400元的禮物，他均一律獲准以個人身分保留",
            "律政司並無發現有低估禮物價值的證據",
            "再者，考慮到所涉禮物的估計價值、送禮場合和有關送禮情況的記錄，再加上沒有證據顯示存在任何賄賂動機，御用大律師認為在這方面沒有充分證據證明任何刑事罪行，而律政司亦同意其看法",
            "此範疇涉及兩個相關方面：（a）有關證據是否足以證明《防止賄賂條例》（特別是第9（2）條）所訂明的任何罪行；以及（b）有關證據是否足以證實任何「公職人員行為失當」的罪行",
            "就上述（a）項，關鍵在於湯顯明是否出於賄賂目的而向內地官員或其他人士餽贈禮物",
            "經考慮後，御用大律師認為而律政司亦同意有關餽贈不涉及任何賄賂目的",
            "雖然部分餽贈屬就個人作出的餽贈，但並沒有證據顯示餽贈有關禮物是要對方作出或不作出任何第9（2）條中所訂明的行為的誘因或報酬，亦不能作出貪污意圖的推論",
            "就上述（b）項，《廉政公署常規》訂明廉署的政策，即官方場合互相餽贈禮物應可免則免，並應限於機構之間的餽贈而不應就個人作出餽贈",
            "然而，當時的《規例》或其他指引均沒有管限廉政專員在官方場合餽贈禮物的可用金額",
            "身為廉署的首長以及香港法例第2章《公務財政條例》所指明的管制人員，湯顯明先生獲授權管制開支",
            "在這情況下，雖然部分禮物餽贈表面上看來是就個人作出的餽贈而且並不恰當，但御用大律師的結論是沒有足夠證據支持事件涉及「公職人員行為失當」罪行中的故意不當行為，律政司亦同意有關結論",
            "湯顯明被指在2010年9月繞過既定程序聘請一名內地學者在廉政建設研究中心（廉署於2009年成立的研究中心）任職",
            "根據當時適用指引，作為部門首長，湯顯明完全有權力和可以酌情決定按「非公務員合約僱員計劃」聘請職員",
            "此外，沒有證據顯示聘請該名學者是出於任何賄賂目的，亦沒有證據顯示湯顯明從中獲取直接或間接利益",
            "御用大律的結論是沒有證據支持任何刑事罪行的控罪，律政司亦同意有關結論",
            "至於湯顯明有否在立法會帳目委員會舉行聆訊時作出虛假陳述，經考慮所有相關情況，包括相關事件發生已有一段時間，御用大律師認為沒有足夠證據顯示湯顯明在宣誓後故意作出他知道或相信為虛假的陳述",
            "因此，御用大律師的結論是沒有足夠證據支持提出任何刑事檢控，而律政司亦同意有關結論",
            "在查究這宗案件是否涉及犯罪行為時，重點是要考慮涉案被指不當行為的所有相關情況，以及當時適用的相關管限規則和規定的複雜性與不足之處",
            "我們明白湯顯明被調查的某些行為可能帶來質疑甚或批評",
            "然而，律政司刑事檢控科的職責，是依據《檢控守則》決定應否提出檢控；此外，檢控只能在有充分證據的基礎時才能提出",
            "因此，今次律政司基於沒有充分證據的考慮決定不作出檢控，不應被理解為律政司認同湯顯明的行為或當中任何部分",
            "註一：《規例》第750（1）及（2）條訂明，「部門首長及經部門首長正式批准的公務員，在執行職務時所花費的酬酢開支，可予以發還」和「酬酢開支如屬（a）與有關人員所執行的職務有直接關係的開支，或以該員的公職身分來說，須用以聯絡有關人士或與他們保持聯絡的必需開支；及（b）為公眾利益而花費的開支，可以用公費支付」",

            "當時的做法是交由部門首長自行決定",
            "再者，當時的《廉政公署常規》中並未明文規定，分開購買餐酒或烈酒的開支必須計算在人均開支限額之內",
