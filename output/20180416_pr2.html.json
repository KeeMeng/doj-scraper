            "Reporter: Mr Wang (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wang Zhimin) said Hong Kong's system is flawed regarding upholding national security. Do you think he is putting pressure on the Government to enact Article 23?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Enacting Article 23 is a constitutional duty of the Hong Kong SAR Government, so that is something to be done. But the important thing is, when it is to be done, it is a matter that the Chief Executive has said a number of times, she will find the appropriate moment that the society and the circumstances would be suitable before this is being looked at. So, at the moment, I would like you all to bear that in mind, and then we will find the appropriate time to discuss the content and how we are going to deal with it. Thank you very much.",
