            "In response to some media reports that repeatedly resort to biased language to describe the Department of Justice (DoJ)'s decisions on appeal or review in some criminal cases, the DoJ today (February 5) reiterated that all decisions on appeal or review are made after thorough consideration and strictly in accordance with relevant laws. The appeal or review cases are then determined by the courts in accordance with the law.",
            "In the course of the legal proceedings, prosecutors of the DoJ have the duty to provide accurate and comprehensive submissions on the law to assist the courts in the determination of cases. In respect of the sentences imposed by the courts, the DoJ will carefully consider the relevant information, including the reports of the prosecutors and the reasons for sentence of the courts. Where appropriate, applications for review of sentence may be instituted by the DoJ in accordance with the Magistrates Ordinance or the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. If the court's verdict of acquittal is perverse or erroneous in point of law, the DoJ may lodge an appeal under the Magistrates Ordinance or the District Court Ordinance.",
            "In 2020, the DoJ lodged a total of 17 applications for the review of sentence under section 81A of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. Of the 12 such applications decided last year, 11 were allowed.",
            "The DoJ has all along strived to ensure the proper conduct of its prosecutions. Prosecutors have always adhered to the highest of professional standards in handling criminal cases for justice to be administered with equal measure and in an even-handed manner at all times. Regrettably, some media, without regard to the grounds put forward by the DoJ at the hearings and the reasons for decisions set out in the courts' judgments, use biased expressions in their reports which do not truly reflect the facts.",

            "律政司的檢控人員在訴訟過程中，有責任提出準確和完整的法律論點，協助法庭審理案件。就法庭所判處的刑罰，律政司會仔細研究相關資料，包括主控官的報告及法庭的判刑理由，並在合適的情況下根據《裁判官條例》或《刑事訴訟程序條例》就刑罰申請覆核。若法庭裁定無罪時出現「有悖常情」的裁決，或出現錯誤法律觀點，律政司亦可根據《裁判官條例》或《區域法院條例》提出上訴。",
            "律政司去年根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81A條提出的刑罰覆核申請有十七宗。在去年經已裁決的十二宗申請中，有十一宗申請得直。",
            "律政司一直致力確保檢控工作執行妥當，檢控人員秉持最高的專業標準處理刑事案件，以同等的尺度，不偏不倚地秉行公義。但很遺憾地有部分傳媒作出報道時，仍然使用帶有偏見的字句，漠視律政司在聆訊上提出的理據和法庭在判決書中陳述的理由，以致未能全面反映事實。",
