            "The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, held a press conference in the afternoon of February 7. Also joining were the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC; the Secretary for Home Affairs, Mr Lau Kong-wah; the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr James Lau; the Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Joshua Law; the Secretary for Security, Mr John Lee; the Secretary for Food and Health, Professor Sophia Chan; the Director of Health, Dr Constance Chan; and the Deputy Secretary for Food and Health (Food), Mr Daniel Cheng. Following is the transcript of remarks of the press conference.",
            "Reporter: Just a few English questions first. First question regarding the quarantine measures. Are there any other measures other than spot checks and the possible legal consequences to make sure that people really are staying at home or staying in the hotels they're booked in? How should people behave when they are being quarantined in these places? And isn't that subjecting other people in the building or other hotel stayers to possible risk or higher risk even? Second question, regarding the people coming into Hong Kong these few days, I'm sure the officials are aware that Mainland visitors entering Hong Kong, particularly through Shenzhen Bay Port, have significantly increased since this mandatory quarantine is announced. With this buffer between the announcement and the actual implementation, have the Hong Kong Government actually already let a lot of potential cases, as some haven't shown symptoms yet, into Hong Kong? And has that increased the risk for the city and adding pressure for our medical system? Third area, regarding the Chief Secretary’s appeal to current and retired government workers to volunteer to help with quarantine efforts, some union leaders are saying that some government workers are being strong-armed or pressured into volunteering to take part, even though they're scared that they might be infected. So what's your response to that? Would there be any follow-up? And has this appeal actually come too late since the measure, like, the quarantine, is coming tomorrow, basically?",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: Let me deal with the third question because you specifically mentioned my name, and I will also answer in general terms the first question about quarantine and leave it to the experts, Professor Chan and also Secretary for Security, to deal with the second question. My appeal to civil servants is a sincere one. It's genuine. We are facing really challenging times and we are talking about social cohesion. It's time for solidarity. I think everybody in the civil service, everyone in the community, should exercise civic responsibility - it's time for us to stand together. Together we stand, divided we fall, right? So we must work hand in hand to tackle this crisis situation, the virus. I'm really making a personal, sincere appeal. I'm telling you that some heads of departments are responding in very positive terms already. I'm receiving very encouraging emails. So any suggestion of coercion is entirely untrue. On the other hand, it's really persuasion, appeal. I'm sure that a number of civil servants will respond to my appeal. So I just want to put the record straight: no question of coercion. It's on a voluntary basis. As the name implies, volunteer.",
            "The first question relates to quarantine. Now let me make an appeal here. The 14-day home quarantine we talked about, basically, the tier two, so-called the tier two quarantine, because these people are not carriers at all. They don't display any symptoms at all. First of all, they are not close contacts, all right? And also they are under close surveillance, close liaison with the Department of Health, the experts there every day - temperature checking and also make sure they wear a mask and all that. What they do is just to stay home. You know, if they've got any needs at all, they've got volunteers to help them. In fact, the Social Welfare Department and Home Affairs Department will stand ready to help them - anything that we can do for them, even childcare, all right? Even buying necessities, buying lunch, dinner, breakfast. And also there will be a hotline provided by Home Affairs Department, I will invite SHA (Secretary for Home Affairs) to supplement. But let me first hand the question to Professor Chan, all right? Then followed by Kong-wah, the SHA.",
            "Secretary for Food and Health: First of all, regarding the objective of this mandatory quarantine, their legal backing is to reduce the cross boundary people flow, as well as to reduce the transmissibility of the virus within the community. The mandatory quarantine for 14 days, as the Chief Secretary alluded to earlier, there are checking and also medical surveillance as well as looking into the condition of the people at home. The whole idea is for this person to stay at home and not to go out. So that in case they carry any virus, it would not be transmitted to the rest of the community. That is the whole idea.",
            "Other than the information packs of health education and also telephone calls to the clients, there will be spot checks and random checks to see whether this person is at home. Of course the condition of these persons, for example, whether they have recorded high temperatures, whether they have any clinical symptoms, would be also checked and recorded by themselves.",
            "There will be periodic checking by the Department of Health colleagues to monitor the situation. Of course, self discipline is the most important because the whole idea is not to put the person at home, and then having a lot of guards outside. It is not for this. Self discipline and having everybody in Hong Kong together fighting this infectious disease is the most important.",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: It all boils down to civic responsibility here. Can I also invite Mr Lau, SHA, to talk a little about the support? Because the Social Welfare Department and also Home Affairs Department underpin the whole exercise as volunteers.",
            "Secretary for Home Affairs: We’ll set up 37 hotlines to deal with those enquiries by the people under home quarantine. They will be running 24 hours by the staff of the HAD.",
            "Reporter: My question about Shenzhen Bay entry?",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: Yes, I will hand the question to John, S for S.",
            "Secretary for Security: Since the Government introduced measures starting on January 30 to suspend the service of six control points and thereafter on February 4, another four control points, we can see the arrival figures have been dropping. On February 5, i.e. the day before yesterday, the total number of people arriving in Hong Kong was 58 800 roughly, that is a drop of 75 per cent compared with the figure before the introduction of the measures. For Hong Kong people arriving, the figure is a drop of 77 per cent; for Mainland visitors, a drop of 68 per cent; for other visitors, a drop of 50 per cent. Yesterday was the single day we saw an increase in the number of arrivals since the introduction of the measures. It is not unexpected because tomorrow we will be implementing the mandatory quarantine for 14 days and it is understandable (that) there are a lot people who either left Hong Kong or left Mainland to come back to Hong Kong or they travel across to sort out some of the businesses for their own arrangement. The key really is on risk management in regard to all these human movements across the border. By introducing the 14-day mandatory quarantine measure, we will be stopping a lot of people, so either today or yesterday, there would be people who would be making arrangements for themselves so as to arrange themselves daily routines to fit into the new arrangement. The question is the frequency will be severely stopped as a result of the measure. So the frequency of travel is the key factor in regard to risk management.",
            "Reporter: So first of all I would like to ask that regarding we’re expecting a large amount of people that would require quarantine, has the Government actually identified new locations for quarantine apart from the three holiday camps, which could only provide 97 units? And you mentioned that for people who do not have residence in Hong Kong, they would, maybe, be quarantined in hotels. But what if hotels were filled, those people would be quarantined there, and if those hotel staff, do they have a duty or obligation to monitor those people in quarantine? And also I would like to follow up a question previously asked by a Chinese-speaking colleague saying that the advice from Professor Gabriel Leung saying that hotels are actually not suitable for quarantine because the ventilation system might allow the virus to be spread through the entire building even the new people they might …(inaudible) Why does the Government still choose hotels as one of the quarantine sites? Thank you.",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: Let me deal with the first question first. The people ordered to go into home quarantine, basically they are low risk - so-called tier two, all right? Tier two. They are not close contacts of confirmed cases. They do not display any symptoms at all, and also are under close surveillance and also close contact with the Department of Health and so on. So they are under regular surveillance all the time. All we have talked about is really for them to spend 14 days on their own, all right? In isolation as it were with full support rendered to them and their families as well, so we are talking about a special category of people under quarantine. Now as far as venues are concerned, the centres are concerned, we’re talking about home quarantine, the problem is solved. Basically we’re talking about staying home, all right? They’ve got their room, their place to live, to operate. For those without accommodation, we’ve got to provide them with accommodation. The challenge therefore is to find enough and suitable venues. That’s why we’re now doing our best. We’re doing our best, searching the right sites. That’s why we call on the community, citizens of Hong Kong exercise our civic responsibility. Time for solidarity, time for understanding, time for social cohesion particularly, as I always stress, it’s social cohesion, time for us to stand together to face the crisis, all right? So, is there anything you want to supplement?",
            "Secretary for Food and Health: Perhaps I can invite the Director of Health to talk more about the places whereby we think whether it is suitable or not for quarantine. As I said earlier about different levels of risk, for example we now placed the close contacts of the confirmed cases in quarantine camps. They are of the highest risk because they are the close contacts of confirmed cases. We also have a quarantine category for people who come from Hubei. Now we are talking about people who are coming from any parts of China in the last 14 days. The risk level is different based on the assessment of the Department of Health.",
            "Director of Health: Under the existing legislation, there are two types of order, namely the isolation order, and the second one is the quarantine order. Isolation applies to patient, infected persons. If there is a case who is highly suspected to be infected by this novel coronavirus and also for confirmed cases, they will be managed in a hospital under isolation. Once confirmed, they will be held there and kept there until they are fully recovered. That’s for isolation. As for quarantine, there are several types of situation when quarantine order will be issued. In the past, we considered the close contact of confirmed cases. For close contact, I mean, for example, household family; if travelling on an airplane, the passengers sitting within a radius of two seats of the confirmed cases. These close contact, so defined, will be put in quarantine centres. The familiar one which you will know will be like Lady MacLehose Holiday Village. So those are the close contacts of confirmed cases. With the passing of the new emergency regulation, which takes effect tonight, it applies to anyone who has ever been to the Mainland in the past 14 days. So they do not fulfill the criteria of having been a close contact of a confirmed case. They are simply anyone who has ever been to the Mainland in the past 14 days. Because of the fact that we want to achieve two purposes, namely, reduce cross-boundary movement of people and secondly, ask those who have been to the Mainland to stay at home. In the past, we advised people to stay at home for 14 days if they have ever been to the Mainland. But with the recent appearance of more local cases, we think it is important and essential for these people to be applied a more stringent measure. By that, instead of just advising them to stay at home, we mandate them to stay at home. These people are relatively low risk and that is why we adopt a different level of quarantine having done the risk assessment.",

            "政務司司長張建宗今日（二月七日）下午舉行記者會。 律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師、民政事務局局長劉江華、財經事務及庫務局局長劉怡翔、公務員事務局局長羅智光、保安局局長李家超、食物及衞生局局長陳肇始教授、衞生署署長陳漢儀醫生及食物及衞生局副秘書長（食物）鄭鍾偉亦有出席。以下是記者會答問內容：",
            "記者：你好，想問當他出境時就要他隔離，那麼你如何可以確保他回到家中或申報的居所隔離，是否一出境時便會監察他回到該處而不是到處走？另外，想問剛才所說會抽查，抽查的百分比是多少?如果抽查是找不到那個人的話，有甚麼辦法可以把他找出來而不會到處走引起社區傳播？還有，想問如何可以追蹤要隔離的那個人，是否用之前所說的那五百條手帶？其實是否夠用？另外，想問有些旅客來到說沒有居所，由政府安排一個住所給他們，而政府安排的住所，即所謂的隔離營又是否夠用？會否有新的隔離營？如有的話，其實之前有說到的某些地方，當區的居民都有很大的不滿聲音，政府會如何解決？",
            "政務司司長：有請陳局長。",
            "食物及衞生局局長：我首先談談原則，然後請我的同事補充多些資料。首先，當他入境時，在未到入境事務處人員時，衞生署港口衞生科的同事已經會向他解釋，給他一個強制檢疫令，亦會解釋法律的後果和應該怎樣做，基本上是指他需要在14天在家居進行檢疫。至於他是否一定需要回家，我們會拿取他的地址、電話，亦會致電給他，希望知道他已回家。正如剛才政務司司長所說，我們都希望大家自律，因為在這個情況下，我們為甚麼要這樣做，除了為了減低人流外，亦希望減低社區傳播，這是十分重要的。如果所有市民減少外出，亦減少從內地回港，這會大大減少這些風險。至於整體詳細的情況請鄭生可以談談。",
            "食物及衞生局副秘書長：我剛才已經解釋過，入境之後，不論是香港居民或非香港居民均不可出境，即是說在（接受檢疫）14日內，第一必定不能出境，第二抵達居所後，我們透過甚麼措施（監察），第一是突擊檢查，當然在第一日抵達後聯絡會特別緊密，突擊檢查包括前往（有關人士）居所，看看他們是否在居所等。我要解釋一下，你問到會不會有追蹤用的手帶，目前的家居檢疫，我們有安排手帶，但就今晚開始實施的家居檢疫，我們會按風險評估去處理，剛才我們也提過，現時從內地入境的人士，風險相對於之前做家居隔離的人士沒有那麼高，所以我們不會從一開始就必定要他們佩戴手帶，但我們亦不排除會按個別個案的情況（處理）。如果（有關人士）曾經離開家居，當然第一時間要去尋找他們，找到之後，我們不排除會對有些個案施加額外條件，甚至乎正如剛才所說，他們須負上刑事責任，我們會作出起訴。至於沒有居所的人士，（由於）我們的營地設施緊絀，但因為按風險，其實他們無需要入住現行檢疫中心，我們會安排這些人士暫住另外的營地設施。",
            "政務司司長：我想回應關於你剛才問有關檢疫中心選址問題，我都想作一個簡單回應。我已經在此作出一個誠懇的呼籲，我們現時很懇切呼籲市民，特別是地區人士，多點包容、多點諒解，因為始終我們是須要找地方。大家都知道我們面對的問題很嚴峻，是整個社會需要面對的問題，希望大家能夠互相包容。政府選址其實是不容易的，現在有三個渡假村，我們已經正在做，但數目其實不多，加起來有97個。現時我們找到荔枝角的饒宗頤中心，亦受到當地居民反對，但我想強調，大家真的不要意氣用事，冷靜地想一想這個問題是社會問題，真的希望大家發揮社會精神。正如我剛才所說，是社會共融的時候，大家互相包容的時候。第二，我們在八鄉少年警訊活動中心亦是一個選址，但這個需要一點時間做一些內部工作，我們會繼續努力尋找適當的選址作為檢疫中心。我一再強調，我們現在說的這種檢疫，即是以家居形式等等，很多進去住的都不是高危人士，大家不要有一個錯覺會傳染，因為很多根本不是真正與患者近距離接觸，根本上可能是很低風險的。我剛才所說，是防患未然，但防患未然都要有適當設施、適當地方給他們，所以大家在一個這樣的角度，不要將這件事過份誇張，大家保持冷靜。我們面對這個挑戰，其實是人人都希望大家能共同努力去解決。多謝。",
            "記者：你好，各位。想問其實二月五日內地經過深圳灣訪港的旅客有2378萬，即升了一倍，其實這個抵旅政策司長會否承認其實是非常失敗──升了一倍？今日也有名跨境學童於屯院（屯門醫院）那邊有點「衝關」去應診，即其實這一個漏洞為何那麼聽專家說，為何不聽何栢良專家、袁國勇專家所說提早封關？直到現在醫護罷工第五日，政府都依然未封那兩個關口？如果醫護人員「中招」的話，政府會怎樣面對？第二個問題是空中服務員根據剛才的四類似乎是不符合豁免的，想問一下司機和空姐他們身體是否特別強，有些抵抗力，為何他們可以獲豁免不需要隔離？最後一條問題想問其實今日第25個case，可否講多些詳細內容？是男性還是女性？是在威院確診的那一宗，謝謝。",
            "政務司司長：好的，第三個問題我請陳教授稍後回應。我想回應剛才深圳灣那方面。剛才李家超局長也講過了，我說兩句再交給他作補充。昨日的數字上，他也解釋得很清楚，這是可以理解的現象，因為你知道明日凌晨零時開始，或今晚午夜十二時開始隔離措施，即是要家居檢疫，所以很多人趕回來香港，這是可以理解的，但這是必然發生的事，所以不要單單拿昨日的數字。回看過去這三日的平均數字，平均來看都是二千多人而已，即在過去三日。但如你拿最後一日去看，當然有上升，這些人士希望能夠盡快在十二時之前、明天之前做了件事。",
            "至於其他方面，我想回應一點，空中服務員方面，待會我想請律政司司長或者有法律的角度補充。所有這些人，包括過關送貨的司機，他們是送貨物的、令香港繼續運作的，是嗎？如果不是這樣，食物也沒有了，所以一定要繼續讓這運作，空中服務員也一樣。他們是要接受醫學的監察，即要探熱、戴口罩；有不適要立即通知醫生方面，要與衞生防護中心有緊密聯繫，完全有配套，即他們不會自己單打獨鬥。我們也很重視有關運作，所以在兩者之間取得平衡，這是一個合適的平衡來的。或者請陳局長先回應第三條問題。司長在法律角度上有沒有補充？如果沒有，請陳局長講一講。",
            "食物及衞生局局長：我請陳漢儀署長講一講第二十五個個案的詳情。",
            "衞生署署長：第二十五宗個案涉及一位五十八歲男子，他在珠海和香港居住，在珠海和澳門工作。他二月四日在珠海出現發燒和咳嗽，二月五日抵港，看過私家醫生，（二月）六日到北區醫院求醫並且入院接受隔離治療，他目前情況穩定。根據病人提供的資料，他在潛伏期時在珠海和澳門工作，二月五日下午在珠海乘坐「金巴」經港珠澳大橋回香港，之後轉乘機場巴士返回上水，他在二月五日（應為二月六日）上午九時由他在上水的家，乘坐的士去看私家醫生，二月六日上午亦是乘坐的士到北區醫院求醫。現在衞生防護中心正在展開流行病學的調查和進行接觸者的工作，我們亦會通報世界衞生組織、內地和澳門有關當局。",
            "政務司司長：李局長有沒有補充？",
            "保安局局長：我們在一月三十日和二月四日兩次暫停了共十個管制站後，出入境人數是不斷下跌的，特別是入境人數都是下跌的，這是第一點，大家要看整個趨勢。第二點就是，我們明白昨天的數字是上升的，亦都解釋過這是可理解及預期之內的，因為很多人會因為明天實行14天強制檢疫措施之前返回香港或返回內地，又或者來回（兩地）去處理他的事情。如果我們只看一天的（數字）上升而明白為甚麼會這樣做，而不去看自從於一月三十日之後入境人數下跌了百分之七十五，是以偏概全，亦不反映整體的情況。大家應該用我們於一月三十日之後所實行不同的措施後，整體數字的大幅下跌，再加上我們明天實行的14天強制檢疫措施，人數是會大大減少的。",
            "記者：司長你好。第一條問題是政府宣布明日開始由內地入境的人士需要進行強制檢疫14日，但如果由其他地方回港，又是否需要隔離？例如由北京往泰國再回香港，或者經港珠澳大橋返港，這些人士是否可避過14日檢疫？剛才也有提到非香港居民入住酒店進行隔離，但今早梁卓偉專家也說到酒店檢疫並不可行，因為有關空氣流通或較侷促等問題，為何政府覺得可行？第三條問題是剛才提到罰則的問題，剛才陳局長也有說到，靠這些強制檢疫的人士自律，假設真的有人不自律，離開家居或酒店範圍，此罰則如何落實？政府如何追蹤這些違法人士？",
            "食物及衞生局局長：強制性的檢疫有法律效力，任何入境人士，首先會由衞生署港口衞生科向其解釋。剛才你所說的兩個情況，皆需要接受14天的強制性檢疫，即是說他可能並不是直接由內地來，但他在過去14日曾經到過內地，任何人如果他到過內地的話，仍需要接受這個強制性的14天檢疫。至於非香港居民，他是前往酒店的話，剛才我們提過，檢疫和現時已有徵狀的人，需要去隔離是不同的，因為如果他要隔離，代表他是一個病人，需要到醫院接受測試，然後接受隔離和治療。至於現在要接受強制性檢疫的人士，我們希望他們留在家中，以及會發一個信息包給他們，提醒他們要有良好的個人衞生，與家中成員的接觸應怎樣及減到最少，每日他們都需要做一些自我檢查項目，也有一些清單他們需要填寫。衞生署同事會不時致電他們，了解整體狀況。在這個大前提下，自律和防患於未然以及他們是沒有病徵的，這幾樣東西大家要留意。",
            "政務司司長：請司長答有關罰則那方面。",
            "律政司司長：最後你提到的罰則，其實很簡單，如果他違反檢疫令的話，就已經屬於違法，相關執法部門可以作出逮捕，繼而進行檢控。",
            "記者：如何作出追蹤？",
            "律政司司長：如何追蹤方面，第一，這位人士不能離開香港，剛才已經說過。這需要一定的調查工作，我相信執法部門會有相關的手段可以進行追蹤。當然，這是一個後着，希望到最後才用上，正如司長和局長都不斷說，政府是希望每一個人都守法，如果有一個檢疫令清楚寫明相關條款，我們希望他們按條款做，因為這不僅為香港、為其他人，其實這是為自己，他自己也需要這樣做，才能確保他自己的健康，亦確保他的家人和整個香港的健康。",
            "政務司司長：或者請鄭副秘書長作一個簡單補充，好嗎？",
            "食物及衞生局副秘書長（食物）：其實根據條例，如果入境人士於入境之前，由內地以外的地方到達香港，只要他在過往14天曾經在內地逗留，都會受制於強制令。",
            "記者：首先想問問從內地需要做家居檢疫措施的人士，他在過關後，究竟他們要自己乘搭車輛回家，還是當局會安排一些車輛接載他們回家？如果要他們自己乘搭車輛的話，會否擔心在他們乘車時都存在一種傳播的風險？以及如何確保他們真的是回家？第二，就是想問他們一個家庭中有一個成員是這類人士，他們回到家中可能有其他家人與他同住，其他家人是否在該14日內可以自由進出，只有該名人士不能步出家門？這會否令到有機會從內地回來的那位家庭成員感染到其他家庭成員，但其他家庭成員因為可以自由進出，將會造成一種社區傳播的風險？另外，還想問問就是你們提到會在家居方面做一個突擊抽查，可否透露一下，其實你們的團隊有多少人會去進行這個突擊檢查？即是阻嚇力度會有多大？即是譬如說同一日會否有機會在同一個單位可能會抽查多於一次？會不會有人覺得在該日已經有人進行突擊檢查，他就會覺得安全可以出外，會否有這樣的情況？另外，就是為甚麼多位官員都多次強調這批人士好像是風險比較低，為甚麼好像比較安心的情況，因為我們看到廣東省其實它的確診病例數字在全國是名列前茅？你們如何去說服市民這批由內地回港人士的風險是低的，是不會造成一個社區傳播？多謝。",
            "政務司司長：這些具體操作問題，或者我請鄭副秘書長回應。教授可以補充。",
            "食物及衞生局副秘書長（食物）：接受這個強制家居檢疫方面，我們是沒有限制他們的家庭成員一定要逗留在家居，即是強制（家居檢疫）十四日。剛才我們已經說過，這個主要是一個風險管理的問題，當然，大家不要忘記在強制家居檢疫期間，其實每一日都要探體温，如果有甚麼病徵就需要立即聯絡（衞生署）和戴口罩。",
            "另外，你問到突擊抽查方面，其實抽查是由甚麼人員進行，主要是有兩方面，一方面是衞生署同事，另一方面是警方同事，即警察。所以人員調配方面，我們會因應有多少這類家居檢疫情況來調節，所以很難一概而論說我們調配多少人手，當然我們希望在今晚凌晨零時開始後，由於有我們這樣的措施，其實會大大減低需要和人流。",
            "我們整個設計正如剛才所說，其實自律是相當重要，所以在他離開關口回家的一段路程，風險來說，因為他們不是（確診者）的緊密接觸人士，所以他們是可以自行乘車返回家居。但我們的抽查和電話聯絡，其實在他們離開關口後已經馬上開始。",
            "食物及衞生局局長：我們現時所有防疫、抗疫的公共衞生措施方面，這個強制性的檢疫是一個重要措施，但這個並不是單一的措施，如果我們要把跨境人流減低，大家都知道當我們知道湖北省有很多很多個案時，我們已經把湖北省居民和過去十四日曾去過湖北的人士已經不可以入境。較早前亦關閉了一些口岸，今次餘下三個不同關口作出入口，我們當然是隨着整體疫情的變化，無論在內地丶國外和香港自己的情況，尤其是我們出現了一些本地感染個案，我們在不同層面都有加強。這個當然是其中一個重要手段，但除此之外，大家不要忘記，就是我們在口岸方面仍會有體溫監測，亦有健康申報，有港口衞生科人員監察。衞生署衞生防護中心都幾次擴大監測範圍，除了擴大監測範圍，醫管局亦加強了監測，例如可能有一些不知名的肺炎，又或是他們對於一些人士或是一些病人的旅遊歷史，他們會與入境處有合作，令急症室醫生也可以知道，其實就算該名病人未有提及，醫生亦可以了解到他在過去三十日是否有曾離開香港，有沒有去其他地方等。這在確診，或取得健康歷史方面的幫助會大很多。",
            "我們在昨日亦有談及醫管局的指定診所準備就緒。這些指定診所的作用是如果我們有更多的個案時，它可以處理一些比較輕微徵狀的個案，令我們能夠及早知道有一些病徵的人士，留意他是否感染新型冠狀病毒。在這方面我們是多管齊下，在不同層面都有防疫、抗疫的工作在進行。",

            "With this buffer between the announcement and the actual implementation, have the Hong Kong Government actually already let a lot of potential cases, as some haven't shown symptoms yet, into Hong Kong? And has that increased the risk for the city and adding pressure for our medical system? Third area, regarding the Chief Secretary’s appeal to current and retired government workers to volunteer to help with quarantine efforts, some union leaders are saying that some government workers are being strong-armed or pressured into volunteering to take part, even though they're scared that they might be infected",
            "So what's your response to that? Would there be any follow-up? And has this appeal actually come too late since the measure, like, the quarantine, is coming tomorrow, basically?",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: Let me deal with the third question because you specifically mentioned my name, and I will also answer in general terms the first question about quarantine and leave it to the experts, Professor Chan and also Secretary for Security, to deal with the second question",
            "My appeal to civil servants is a sincere one",
            "It's genuine",
            "We are facing really challenging times and we are talking about social cohesion",
            "It's time for solidarity",
            "I think everybody in the civil service, everyone in the community, should exercise civic responsibility - it's time for us to stand together",
            "Together we stand, divided we fall, right? So we must work hand in hand to tackle this crisis situation, the virus",
            "I'm really making a personal, sincere appeal",
            "I'm telling you that some heads of departments are responding in very positive terms already",
            "I'm receiving very encouraging emails",
            "So any suggestion of coercion is entirely untrue",
            "On the other hand, it's really persuasion, appeal",
            "I'm sure that a number of civil servants will respond to my appeal",
            "So I just want to put the record straight: no question of coercion",
            "It's on a voluntary basis",
            "As the name implies, volunteer.",
            "The first question relates to quarantine",
            "Now let me make an appeal here",
            "The 14-day home quarantine we talked about, basically, the tier two, so-called the tier two quarantine, because these people are not carriers at all",
            "They don't display any symptoms at all",
            "First of all, they are not close contacts, all right? And also they are under close surveillance, close liaison with the Department of Health, the experts there every day - temperature checking and also make sure they wear a mask and all that",
            "What they do is just to stay home",
            "You know, if they've got any needs at all, they've got volunteers to help them",
            "In fact, the Social Welfare Department and Home Affairs Department will stand ready to help them - anything that we can do for them, even childcare, all right? Even buying necessities, buying lunch, dinner, breakfast",
            "And also there will be a hotline provided by Home Affairs Department, I will invite SHA (Secretary for Home Affairs) to supplement",
            "But let me first hand the question to Professor Chan, all right? Then followed by Kong-wah, the SHA.",
            "Secretary for Food and Health: First of all, regarding the objective of this mandatory quarantine, their legal backing is to reduce the cross boundary people flow, as well as to reduce the transmissibility of the virus within the community",
            "The mandatory quarantine for 14 days, as the Chief Secretary alluded to earlier, there are checking and also medical surveillance as well as looking into the condition of the people at home",
            "The whole idea is for this person to stay at home and not to go out",
            "So that in case they carry any virus, it would not be transmitted to the rest of the community",
            "That is the whole idea.",
            "Other than the information packs of health education and also telephone calls to the clients, there will be spot checks and random checks to see whether this person is at home",
            "Of course the condition of these persons, for example, whether they have recorded high temperatures, whether they have any clinical symptoms, would be also checked and recorded by themselves.",
            "There will be periodic checking by the Department of Health colleagues to monitor the situation",
            "Of course, self discipline is the most important because the whole idea is not to put the person at home, and then having a lot of guards outside",
            "It is not for this",
            "Self discipline and having everybody in Hong Kong together fighting this infectious disease is the most important.",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: It all boils down to civic responsibility here",
            "Can I also invite Mr Lau, SHA, to talk a little about the support? Because the Social Welfare Department and also Home Affairs Department underpin the whole exercise as volunteers.",
            "Secretary for Home Affairs: We’ll set up 37 hotlines to deal with those enquiries by the people under home quarantine",
            "They will be running 24 hours by the staff of the HAD.",
            "Reporter: My question about Shenzhen Bay entry?",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: Yes, I will hand the question to John, S for S.",
            "Secretary for Security: Since the Government introduced measures starting on January 30 to suspend the service of six control points and thereafter on February 4, another four control points, we can see the arrival figures have been dropping",
            "On February 5, i.e",
            "the day before yesterday, the total number of people arriving in Hong Kong was 58 800 roughly, that is a drop of 75 per cent compared with the figure before the introduction of the measures",
            "For Hong Kong people arriving, the figure is a drop of 77 per cent; for Mainland visitors, a drop of 68 per cent; for other visitors, a drop of 50 per cent",
            "Yesterday was the single day we saw an increase in the number of arrivals since the introduction of the measures",
            "It is not unexpected because tomorrow we will be implementing the mandatory quarantine for 14 days and it is understandable (that) there are a lot people who either left Hong Kong or left Mainland to come back to Hong Kong or they travel across to sort out some of the businesses for their own arrangement",
            "The key really is on risk management in regard to all these human movements across the border",
            "By introducing the 14-day mandatory quarantine measure, we will be stopping a lot of people, so either today or yesterday, there would be people who would be making arrangements for themselves so as to arrange themselves daily routines to fit into the new arrangement",
            "The question is the frequency will be severely stopped as a result of the measure",
            "So the frequency of travel is the key factor in regard to risk management.",
            "Reporter: So first of all I would like to ask that regarding we’re expecting a large amount of people that would require quarantine, has the Government actually identified new locations for quarantine apart from the three holiday camps, which could only provide 97 units? And you mentioned that for people who do not have residence in Hong Kong, they would, maybe, be quarantined in hotels",
            "But what if hotels were filled, those people would be quarantined there, and if those hotel staff, do they have a duty or obligation to monitor those people in quarantine? And also I would like to follow up a question previously asked by a Chinese-speaking colleague saying that the advice from Professor Gabriel Leung saying that hotels are actually not suitable for quarantine because the ventilation system might allow the virus to be spread through the entire building even the new people they might …(inaudible) Why does the Government still choose hotels as one of the quarantine sites? Thank you.",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: Let me deal with the first question first",
            "The people ordered to go into home quarantine, basically they are low risk - so-called tier two, all right? Tier two",
            "They are not close contacts of confirmed cases",
            "They do not display any symptoms at all, and also are under close surveillance and also close contact with the Department of Health and so on",
            "So they are under regular surveillance all the time",
            "All we have talked about is really for them to spend 14 days on their own, all right? In isolation as it were with full support rendered to them and their families as well, so we are talking about a special category of people under quarantine",
            "Now as far as venues are concerned, the centres are concerned, we’re talking about home quarantine, the problem is solved",
            "Basically we’re talking about staying home, all right? They’ve got their room, their place to live, to operate",
            "For those without accommodation, we’ve got to provide them with accommodation",
            "The challenge therefore is to find enough and suitable venues",
            "That’s why we’re now doing our best",
            "We’re doing our best, searching the right sites",
            "That’s why we call on the community, citizens of Hong Kong exercise our civic responsibility",
            "Time for solidarity, time for understanding, time for social cohesion particularly, as I always stress, it’s social cohesion, time for us to stand together to face the crisis, all right? So, is there anything you want to supplement?",
            "Secretary for Food and Health: Perhaps I can invite the Director of Health to talk more about the places whereby we think whether it is suitable or not for quarantine",
            "As I said earlier about different levels of risk, for example we now placed the close contacts of the confirmed cases in quarantine camps",
            "They are of the highest risk because they are the close contacts of confirmed cases",
            "We also have a quarantine category for people who come from Hubei",
            "Now we are talking about people who are coming from any parts of China in the last 14 days",
            "The risk level is different based on the assessment of the Department of Health.",
            "Director of Health: Under the existing legislation, there are two types of order, namely the isolation order, and the second one is the quarantine order",
            "Isolation applies to patient, infected persons",
            "If there is a case who is highly suspected to be infected by this novel coronavirus and also for confirmed cases, they will be managed in a hospital under isolation",
            "Once confirmed, they will be held there and kept there until they are fully recovered",
            "That’s for isolation",
            "As for quarantine, there are several types of situation when quarantine order will be issued",
            "In the past, we considered the close contact of confirmed cases",
            "For close contact, I mean, for example, household family; if travelling on an airplane, the passengers sitting within a radius of two seats of the confirmed cases",
            "These close contact, so defined, will be put in quarantine centres",
            "The familiar one which you will know will be like Lady MacLehose Holiday Village",
            "So those are the close contacts of confirmed cases",
            "With the passing of the new emergency regulation, which takes effect tonight, it applies to anyone who has ever been to the Mainland in the past 14 days",
            "So they do not fulfill the criteria of having been a close contact of a confirmed case",
            "They are simply anyone who has ever been to the Mainland in the past 14 days",
            "Because of the fact that we want to achieve two purposes, namely, reduce cross-boundary movement of people and secondly, ask those who have been to the Mainland to stay at home",
            "In the past, we advised people to stay at home for 14 days if they have ever been to the Mainland",
            "But with the recent appearance of more local cases, we think it is important and essential for these people to be applied a more stringent measure",
            "By that, instead of just advising them to stay at home, we mandate them to stay at home",
            "These people are relatively low risk and that is why we adopt a different level of quarantine having done the risk assessment.",
            "(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the transcript.)",

            "政務司司長張建宗今日（二月七日）下午舉行記者會",
            "律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師、民政事務局局長劉江華、財經事務及庫務局局長劉怡翔、公務員事務局局長羅智光、保安局局長李家超、食物及衞生局局長陳肇始教授、衞生署署長陳漢儀醫生及食物及衞生局副秘書長（食物）鄭鍾偉亦有出席",
            "以下是記者會答問內容：",
            "記者：你好，想問當他出境時就要他隔離，那麼你如何可以確保他回到家中或申報的居所隔離，是否一出境時便會監察他回到該處而不是到處走？另外，想問剛才所說會抽查，抽查的百分比是多少?如果抽查是找不到那個人的話，有甚麼辦法可以把他找出來而不會到處走引起社區傳播？還有，想問如何可以追蹤要隔離的那個人，是否用之前所說的那五百條手帶？其實是否夠用？另外，想問有些旅客來到說沒有居所，由政府安排一個住所給他們，而政府安排的住所，即所謂的隔離營又是否夠用？會否有新的隔離營？如有的話，其實之前有說到的某些地方，當區的居民都有很大的不滿聲音，政府會如何解決？",
            "政務司司長：有請陳局長",
            "食物及衞生局局長：我首先談談原則，然後請我的同事補充多些資料",
            "首先，當他入境時，在未到入境事務處人員時，衞生署港口衞生科的同事已經會向他解釋，給他一個強制檢疫令，亦會解釋法律的後果和應該怎樣做，基本上是指他需要在14天在家居進行檢疫",
            "至於他是否一定需要回家，我們會拿取他的地址、電話，亦會致電給他，希望知道他已回家",
            "正如剛才政務司司長所說，我們都希望大家自律，因為在這個情況下，我們為甚麼要這樣做，除了為了減低人流外，亦希望減低社區傳播，這是十分重要的",
            "如果所有市民減少外出，亦減少從內地回港，這會大大減少這些風險",
            "至於整體詳細的情況請鄭生可以談談",
            "食物及衞生局副秘書長：我剛才已經解釋過，入境之後，不論是香港居民或非香港居民均不可出境，即是說在（接受檢疫）14日內，第一必定不能出境，第二抵達居所後，我們透過甚麼措施（監察），第一是突擊檢查，當然在第一日抵達後聯絡會特別緊密，突擊檢查包括前往（有關人士）居所，看看他們是否在居所等",
            "我要解釋一下，你問到會不會有追蹤用的手帶，目前的家居檢疫，我們有安排手帶，但就今晚開始實施的家居檢疫，我們會按風險評估去處理，剛才我們也提過，現時從內地入境的人士，風險相對於之前做家居隔離的人士沒有那麼高，所以我們不會從一開始就必定要他們佩戴手帶，但我們亦不排除會按個別個案的情況（處理）",
            "如果（有關人士）曾經離開家居，當然第一時間要去尋找他們，找到之後，我們不排除會對有些個案施加額外條件，甚至乎正如剛才所說，他們須負上刑事責任，我們會作出起訴",
            "至於沒有居所的人士，（由於）我們的營地設施緊絀，但因為按風險，其實他們無需要入住現行檢疫中心，我們會安排這些人士暫住另外的營地設施",
            "政務司司長：我想回應關於你剛才問有關檢疫中心選址問題，我都想作一個簡單回應",
            "我已經在此作出一個誠懇的呼籲，我們現時很懇切呼籲市民，特別是地區人士，多點包容、多點諒解，因為始終我們是須要找地方",
            "大家都知道我們面對的問題很嚴峻，是整個社會需要面對的問題，希望大家能夠互相包容",
            "政府選址其實是不容易的，現在有三個渡假村，我們已經正在做，但數目其實不多，加起來有97個",
            "現時我們找到荔枝角的饒宗頤中心，亦受到當地居民反對，但我想強調，大家真的不要意氣用事，冷靜地想一想這個問題是社會問題，真的希望大家發揮社會精神",
            "正如我剛才所說，是社會共融的時候，大家互相包容的時候",
            "第二，我們在八鄉少年警訊活動中心亦是一個選址，但這個需要一點時間做一些內部工作，我們會繼續努力尋找適當的選址作為檢疫中心",
            "我一再強調，我們現在說的這種檢疫，即是以家居形式等等，很多進去住的都不是高危人士，大家不要有一個錯覺會傳染，因為很多根本不是真正與患者近距離接觸，根本上可能是很低風險的",
            "我剛才所說，是防患未然，但防患未然都要有適當設施、適當地方給他們，所以大家在一個這樣的角度，不要將這件事過份誇張，大家保持冷靜",
            "我們面對這個挑戰，其實是人人都希望大家能共同努力去解決",
            "多謝",
            "記者：你好，各位",
            "想問其實二月五日內地經過深圳灣訪港的旅客有2378萬，即升了一倍，其實這個抵旅政策司長會否承認其實是非常失敗──升了一倍？今日也有名跨境學童於屯院（屯門醫院）那邊有點「衝關」去應診，即其實這一個漏洞為何那麼聽專家說，為何不聽何栢良專家、袁國勇專家所說提早封關？直到現在醫護罷工第五日，政府都依然未封那兩個關口？如果醫護人員「中招」的話，政府會怎樣面對？第二個問題是空中服務員根據剛才的四類似乎是不符合豁免的，想問一下司機和空姐他們身體是否特別強，有些抵抗力，為何他們可以獲豁免不需要隔離？最後一條問題想問其實今日第25個case，可否講多些詳細內容？是男性還是女性？是在威院確診的那一宗，謝謝",
            "政務司司長：好的，第三個問題我請陳教授稍後回應",
            "我想回應剛才深圳灣那方面",
            "剛才李家超局長也講過了，我說兩句再交給他作補充",
            "昨日的數字上，他也解釋得很清楚，這是可以理解的現象，因為你知道明日凌晨零時開始，或今晚午夜十二時開始隔離措施，即是要家居檢疫，所以很多人趕回來香港，這是可以理解的，但這是必然發生的事，所以不要單單拿昨日的數字",
            "回看過去這三日的平均數字，平均來看都是二千多人而已，即在過去三日",
            "但如你拿最後一日去看，當然有上升，這些人士希望能夠盡快在十二時之前、明天之前做了件事",
            "至於其他方面，我想回應一點，空中服務員方面，待會我想請律政司司長或者有法律的角度補充",
            "所有這些人，包括過關送貨的司機，他們是送貨物的、令香港繼續運作的，是嗎？如果不是這樣，食物也沒有了，所以一定要繼續讓這運作，空中服務員也一樣",
            "他們是要接受醫學的監察，即要探熱、戴口罩；有不適要立即通知醫生方面，要與衞生防護中心有緊密聯繫，完全有配套，即他們不會自己單打獨鬥",
            "我們也很重視有關運作，所以在兩者之間取得平衡，這是一個合適的平衡來的",
            "或者請陳局長先回應第三條問題",
            "司長在法律角度上有沒有補充？如果沒有，請陳局長講一講",
            "食物及衞生局局長：我請陳漢儀署長講一講第二十五個個案的詳情",
            "衞生署署長：第二十五宗個案涉及一位五十八歲男子，他在珠海和香港居住，在珠海和澳門工作",
            "他二月四日在珠海出現發燒和咳嗽，二月五日抵港，看過私家醫生，（二月）六日到北區醫院求醫並且入院接受隔離治療，他目前情況穩定",
            "根據病人提供的資料，他在潛伏期時在珠海和澳門工作，二月五日下午在珠海乘坐「金巴」經港珠澳大橋回香港，之後轉乘機場巴士返回上水，他在二月五日（應為二月六日）上午九時由他在上水的家，乘坐的士去看私家醫生，二月六日上午亦是乘坐的士到北區醫院求醫",
            "現在衞生防護中心正在展開流行病學的調查和進行接觸者的工作，我們亦會通報世界衞生組織、內地和澳門有關當局",
            "政務司司長：李局長有沒有補充？",
            "保安局局長：我們在一月三十日和二月四日兩次暫停了共十個管制站後，出入境人數是不斷下跌的，特別是入境人數都是下跌的，這是第一點，大家要看整個趨勢",
            "第二點就是，我們明白昨天的數字是上升的，亦都解釋過這是可理解及預期之內的，因為很多人會因為明天實行14天強制檢疫措施之前返回香港或返回內地，又或者來回（兩地）去處理他的事情",
            "如果我們只看一天的（數字）上升而明白為甚麼會這樣做，而不去看自從於一月三十日之後入境人數下跌了百分之七十五，是以偏概全，亦不反映整體的情況",
            "大家應該用我們於一月三十日之後所實行不同的措施後，整體數字的大幅下跌，再加上我們明天實行的14天強制檢疫措施，人數是會大大減少的",
            "記者：司長你好",
            "第一條問題是政府宣布明日開始由內地入境的人士需要進行強制檢疫14日，但如果由其他地方回港，又是否需要隔離？例如由北京往泰國再回香港，或者經港珠澳大橋返港，這些人士是否可避過14日檢疫？剛才也有提到非香港居民入住酒店進行隔離，但今早梁卓偉專家也說到酒店檢疫並不可行，因為有關空氣流通或較侷促等問題，為何政府覺得可行？第三條問題是剛才提到罰則的問題，剛才陳局長也有說到，靠這些強制檢疫的人士自律，假設真的有人不自律，離開家居或酒店範圍，此罰則如何落實？政府如何追蹤這些違法人士？",
            "食物及衞生局局長：強制性的檢疫有法律效力，任何入境人士，首先會由衞生署港口衞生科向其解釋",
            "剛才你所說的兩個情況，皆需要接受14天的強制性檢疫，即是說他可能並不是直接由內地來，但他在過去14日曾經到過內地，任何人如果他到過內地的話，仍需要接受這個強制性的14天檢疫",
            "至於非香港居民，他是前往酒店的話，剛才我們提過，檢疫和現時已有徵狀的人，需要去隔離是不同的，因為如果他要隔離，代表他是一個病人，需要到醫院接受測試，然後接受隔離和治療",
            "至於現在要接受強制性檢疫的人士，我們希望他們留在家中，以及會發一個信息包給他們，提醒他們要有良好的個人衞生，與家中成員的接觸應怎樣及減到最少，每日他們都需要做一些自我檢查項目，也有一些清單他們需要填寫",
            "衞生署同事會不時致電他們，了解整體狀況",
            "在這個大前提下，自律和防患於未然以及他們是沒有病徵的，這幾樣東西大家要留意",
            "政務司司長：請司長答有關罰則那方面",
            "律政司司長：最後你提到的罰則，其實很簡單，如果他違反檢疫令的話，就已經屬於違法，相關執法部門可以作出逮捕，繼而進行檢控",
            "記者：如何作出追蹤？",
            "律政司司長：如何追蹤方面，第一，這位人士不能離開香港，剛才已經說過",
            "這需要一定的調查工作，我相信執法部門會有相關的手段可以進行追蹤",
            "當然，這是一個後着，希望到最後才用上，正如司長和局長都不斷說，政府是希望每一個人都守法，如果有一個檢疫令清楚寫明相關條款，我們希望他們按條款做，因為這不僅為香港、為其他人，其實這是為自己，他自己也需要這樣做，才能確保他自己的健康，亦確保他的家人和整個香港的健康",
            "政務司司長：或者請鄭副秘書長作一個簡單補充，好嗎？",
            "食物及衞生局副秘書長（食物）：其實根據條例，如果入境人士於入境之前，由內地以外的地方到達香港，只要他在過往14天曾經在內地逗留，都會受制於強制令",
            "記者：首先想問問從內地需要做家居檢疫措施的人士，他在過關後，究竟他們要自己乘搭車輛回家，還是當局會安排一些車輛接載他們回家？如果要他們自己乘搭車輛的話，會否擔心在他們乘車時都存在一種傳播的風險？以及如何確保他們真的是回家？第二，就是想問他們一個家庭中有一個成員是這類人士，他們回到家中可能有其他家人與他同住，其他家人是否在該14日內可以自由進出，只有該名人士不能步出家門？這會否令到有機會從內地回來的那位家庭成員感染到其他家庭成員，但其他家庭成員因為可以自由進出，將會造成一種社區傳播的風險？另外，還想問問就是你們提到會在家居方面做一個突擊抽查，可否透露一下，其實你們的團隊有多少人會去進行這個突擊檢查？即是阻嚇力度會有多大？即是譬如說同一日會否有機會在同一個單位可能會抽查多於一次？會不會有人覺得在該日已經有人進行突擊檢查，他就會覺得安全可以出外，會否有這樣的情況？另外，就是為甚麼多位官員都多次強調這批人士好像是風險比較低，為甚麼好像比較安心的情況，因為我們看到廣東省其實它的確診病例數字在全國是名列前茅？你們如何去說服市民這批由內地回港人士的風險是低的，是不會造成一個社區傳播？多謝",

            "教授可以補充",
            "食物及衞生局副秘書長（食物）：接受這個強制家居檢疫方面，我們是沒有限制他們的家庭成員一定要逗留在家居，即是強制（家居檢疫）十四日",
            "剛才我們已經說過，這個主要是一個風險管理的問題，當然，大家不要忘記在強制家居檢疫期間，其實每一日都要探體温，如果有甚麼病徵就需要立即聯絡（衞生署）和戴口罩",
            "另外，你問到突擊抽查方面，其實抽查是由甚麼人員進行，主要是有兩方面，一方面是衞生署同事，另一方面是警方同事，即警察",
            "所以人員調配方面，我們會因應有多少這類家居檢疫情況來調節，所以很難一概而論說我們調配多少人手，當然我們希望在今晚凌晨零時開始後，由於有我們這樣的措施，其實會大大減低需要和人流",
            "我們整個設計正如剛才所說，其實自律是相當重要，所以在他離開關口回家的一段路程，風險來說，因為他們不是（確診者）的緊密接觸人士，所以他們是可以自行乘車返回家居",
            "但我們的抽查和電話聯絡，其實在他們離開關口後已經馬上開始",
            "食物及衞生局局長：我們現時所有防疫、抗疫的公共衞生措施方面，這個強制性的檢疫是一個重要措施，但這個並不是單一的措施，如果我們要把跨境人流減低，大家都知道當我們知道湖北省有很多很多個案時，我們已經把湖北省居民和過去十四日曾去過湖北的人士已經不可以入境",
            "較早前亦關閉了一些口岸，今次餘下三個不同關口作出入口，我們當然是隨着整體疫情的變化，無論在內地丶國外和香港自己的情況，尤其是我們出現了一些本地感染個案，我們在不同層面都有加強",
            "這個當然是其中一個重要手段，但除此之外，大家不要忘記，就是我們在口岸方面仍會有體溫監測，亦有健康申報，有港口衞生科人員監察",
            "衞生署衞生防護中心都幾次擴大監測範圍，除了擴大監測範圍，醫管局亦加強了監測，例如可能有一些不知名的肺炎，又或是他們對於一些人士或是一些病人的旅遊歷史，他們會與入境處有合作，令急症室醫生也可以知道，其實就算該名病人未有提及，醫生亦可以了解到他在過去三十日是否有曾離開香港，有沒有去其他地方等",
            "這在確診，或取得健康歷史方面的幫助會大很多",
            "我們在昨日亦有談及醫管局的指定診所準備就緒",
            "這些指定診所的作用是如果我們有更多的個案時，它可以處理一些比較輕微徵狀的個案，令我們能夠及早知道有一些病徵的人士，留意他是否感染新型冠狀病毒",
            "在這方面我們是多管齊下，在不同層面都有防疫、抗疫的工作在進行",
