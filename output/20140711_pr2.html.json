            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, on the constitutional reform consultation today (July 11):",
            "Reporter: Has the Task Force actually taken the Bar Association's views in April out of context? How can you ensure the Chief Executive's report to Beijing will not take any comments out of context?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I don't think the group that we are working on has taken the Bar Association's views out of context. I think in the past, there might be occasions that the three of us or one of the three of us or some other persons, whether within or beyond the government, have quoted part of the Bar Association's opinion. That is just natural because when a particular or specific issue is being raised, of course you rely on the relevant part of the Bar Association's opinion. For instance, if someone raises issue A, you won't quote the part of the Bar Association's opinion on issue B. That doesn't seem to work and therefore I don't think there's any previous instance whereby the three of us have quoted or rely on the Bar Association's opinion out of context.",
            "In relation to the second part of your question, I am sure the report by the Chief Executive would accurately and duly summarise the current situation both derived from the consultation report as well as, where possible, events which happened after the expiry of the consultation period.",
