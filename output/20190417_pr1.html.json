            "Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (April 17):",
            "Question:",
            "Since April 30 last year, the Listing Rules permit emerging and innovative companies with weighted voting right structures to apply for listing on the Main Board of Hong Kong. Some members of the securities industry have pointed out that given the absence of a class action regime in Hong Kong at present, the interests of the minority shareholders of such type of companies may not be adequately protected. On the other hand, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC) published in May 2012 a Report on Class Actions (Report), recommending the introduction, under an incremental approach, of a class action regime in Hong Kong. The Department of Justice has established a cross-sector working group (working group) to study and consider the recommendations made in the Report. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the work progress of the working group in studying and considering the recommendations made in the Report;",
            "(2) as the LRC has put forward in the Report that (i) a comprehensive regime for class actions should be established, and (ii) the scope of a class action regime may start with consumer cases and may be extended to other cases in the light of the experience gained, whether the Government will introduce a class action regime along these two directions; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that; and",
            "(3) whether it will, by following the practices of certain countries (such as the United States), introduce a class action regime for cases involving listed companies, so as to protect the interests of the minority shareholders; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "In respect of the three parts of the question, in consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our consolidated reply is set out as follows:",
            "As regards the Law Reform Commission's (LRC) Report on Class Actions (Report), the cross-sector Working Group established by the Department of Justice carries on studying and considering the Report. As at April 17, 2019, the Working Group has held 25 meetings since its inception while a sub-committee set up under the Working Group has met 30 times.",
            "The subject of class actions involves wide-ranging, complex and interrelated issues covering not only technical issues in law but also policy considerations. In relation to these two aspects, there is still room for deliberation regarding the details from the implementation angle, and time is required for more in-depth analysis.",
            "At this stage, the Working Group's study mainly focuses on considering the LRC's recommendation on an incremental approach to implementing a class action regime in Hong Kong starting with consumer cases. The Working Group's study includes, among others, the proposed definition of \"consumer cases\", certification criteria for a class action to be adopted by the Court, the design of the procedural rules and other ancillary measures. Upon completion of the study, the Working Group will put forward its recommendations for the Government to consider and map out the way forward.",
            "Although there is not yet a specific timetable for consulting the public, the secretariat of the Working Group has started compiling a draft consultation document in parallel based on the research papers and deliberations of the Working Group, and the Working Group has started reviewing the draft. At this stage, the draft consultation document proposes to cover the following specific issues:",
            "*a close scrutiny of the LRC's proposed definitions of \"consumer\" and \"consumer cases\";",
            "*how potential litigants may be included (or excluded) from an intended class action;",
            "*the procedural features of a workable proposed class action regime that would also achieve the stated policy objectives of the regime;",
            "*the interface of litigation by way of class action with other forms of dispute resolution;",
            "*appropriate mechanisms for determining class action awards and distributing them fairly amongst the class members;",
            "*costs implications; and",
            "*the resulting draft bill.",
            "In facilitating companies from the emerging and innovative sectors to be listed in Hong Kong, the Government and financial regulators always take the premise that appropriate safeguards to the investors should be ensured. In this connection, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) has put in place some additional safeguards for companies with weighted voting rights (WVR) structures in the new listing regime implemented in end-April 2018, including requirements for WVR beneficiaries, limits on WVR powers and enhanced corporate governance and disclosure requirements, etc.",
            "According to the LRC's recommendation regarding the introduction of a class action regime in the Report, disputes among company shareholders or issues of shareholders' rights would not be covered at the initial stage. In fact, in other financial markets (including the United States), class action cases were most often brought in relation to matters relating to the disclosure of information. The SEHK has already put in place additional disclosure requirements for companies with WVR structures. Under the existing rules, the Court may exercise discretion to handle proceedings involving the same interest of numerous persons through \"representative proceedings\" should the plaintiffs satisfy the threefold test of establishing \"a common interest, a common grievance and a remedy which is beneficial to all the plaintiffs\".",

            "（一）工作小組研究和考慮報告書所提建議的工作進展為何；",
            "（二）鑑於法改會在報告書中提出，（i）應為集體訴訟設立一套全面的機制，以及（ii）集體訴訟機制的適用範圍可先由消費者案件開始，然後隨着經驗的積累可擴及至其他案件，政府會否循該兩個方向引入集體訴訟機制；如會，詳情及時間表為何；如否，原因為何；及",
            "（三）會否仿效某些國家（例如美國）的做法，就涉及上市公司的案件引入集體訴訟機制，以保障小股東的利益；如會，詳情及時間表為何；如否，原因為何？",

            "集體訴訟這議題涉及的問題既廣泛又複雜，且環環相扣，不單有法律上的技術性問題，也有政策上的取向問題。就這兩方面，在考慮如何實施《報告書》建議的細節上仍有討論空間，需要時間作更深入分析。",
            "現階段，工作小組研究的內容主要集中考慮《報告書》內提出先由消費者案件開始引入集體訴訟這項建議。而研究的內容包括「消費者案件」的定義、法院批准集體訴訟時應採取的準則、法律程序設計及其他配套等。在完成研究後，工作小組將提出建議，以供政府考慮並定出未來路向。",
            "雖然未有諮詢公眾的具體時間表，但現時工作小組的秘書處已着手同步把工作小組的研究文件和研究結果逐一輯成諮詢文件的草稿，而工作小組亦已開始檢視草稿的內容。現階段，諮詢文件草稿所涵蓋的詳細議題包括：",
            "＊關於法改會建議的「消費者」和「消費者案件」定義的仔細研究；",
            "＊如何把潛在的訴訟人吸納（或排除）於擬集體訴訟案件當中；",

            "＊訟費的問題；及",
            "＊落實以上結論的法例草案。",
            "在便利新興及創新產業公司來港上市時，政府及監管機構一直以確保投資者得到適當保障為前提。因此，香港聯合交易所（聯交所）已在二○一八年四月底實施的新上市制度中，對擁有不同投票權架構的公司提出了額外的投資者保障措施，包括對不同投票權受益人施加規定、對不同投票權的權力施加限制，以及加強企業管治和披露規定等。",
            "法改會在《報告書》中就引入集體訴訟機制的建議在初階段不涵蓋公司內部股東之間的爭議或股東權益問題。事實上，在其他金融市場（包括美國），大多數集體訴訟個案主要涉及披露問題，而聯交所已在新上市制度中對擁有不同投票權架構的公司制定了額外的披露規定。在現行規則下，法庭可行使酌情權，在原告人通過「權益相同、苦況相同以及補救對所有原告人皆有利」三重驗證的情況下，透過「代表的法律程序」處理涉及多人有相同權益的法律程序。",
