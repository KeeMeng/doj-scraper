            "In light of the persistent harassment against a judge while handling court cases, the Department of Justice issued the following statement today (July 8):",
            "Article 85 of the Basic Law stipulates, \"The courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference.\" The HKSAR Government will not tolerate any act of harassment against judges while performing their judicial duties. If there is any attempt to exert influence over court proceedings through despicable means, the HKSAR Government will spare no effort in bringing the culprit to justice in order to safeguard the due administration of the judicial process and public peace.",
            "Acts of harassment may constitute criminal offences. Under section 24 of the Crimes Ordinance, anyone who threatens any other person with injury to him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Section 20(c) of the Summary Offences Ordinance points out that any person persistently making telephone calls without reasonable cause and for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to any other person commits a crime. Such acts may also be seen as perverting the course of justice. If an act creates a real risk of prejudice to court proceedings in that the public confidence in the due administration of justice is undermined, it may amount to contempt of court. These are serious offences that may attract a maximum sentence up to seven years' imprisonment.",
            "Any acts of harassment, personal attacks, insults and even threats against judges would severely undermine the authority of the courts and damage public confidence in the judicial system. It is disgraceful to disrupt social order maliciously with an attempt to interfere with court proceedings. Offenders not only act in blatant defiance of the law and undermine the rule of law, but also break the law and must bear severe legal consequences.",

            "對於有法官表示在處理案件期間不斷遭受滋擾，律政司今日（七月八日）發表以下聲明：",
            "《基本法》第八十五條列明「香港特別行政區法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉」，特區政府絕不容忍法官因履行司法職能而受到滋擾。任何人企圖以卑劣手法影響法官審訊，特區政府必定會嚴肅跟進，將不法之徒繩之於法，保障司法工作妥善執行以及社會安寧。",
            "滋擾行為有機會構成刑事罪行，任何人都不應以身試法。《刑事罪行條例》第24條指出，威脅他人使其人身遭受損害，即屬違法；而《簡易程序治罪條例》第20（c）列明，任何人無合理因由而不斷以打電話，旨在對他人造成煩擾或不便，或產生不必要的憂慮，亦屬犯罪。有關行為亦可能觸犯妨礙司法公正，若有確實風險對法庭程序構成干擾，削弱公眾對妥善執行司法工作的信心，更可能干犯藐視法庭。以上的罪行性質嚴重，違法者有機會最高被判處監禁七年。",
            "任何滋擾法官的行為、人身攻擊及辱罵，甚至是向他們作出威嚇，均嚴重損害法院的權威及打擊公眾對司法制度的信心。違法者惡意破壞社會秩序，企圖干擾法庭程序，行徑令人不齒。他們不單止漠視法紀、踐踏法治，更會觸犯法律，必定要承擔法律後果。",
