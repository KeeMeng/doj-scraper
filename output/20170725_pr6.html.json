            "The Government announced yesterday (July 25) the implementation of Hong Kong and Mainland customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) procedures (clearance procedures) at the West Kowloon Station (WKS) of the Hong Kong Section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) (hereinafter referred as the co-location arrangement). The arrangement was endorsed by the Chief Executive in Council on the same day.",
            "The Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC; the Secretary for Transport and Housing, Mr Frank Chan Fan; and the Secretary for Security, Mr John Lee, held a press conference at the Central Government Offices to explain the co-location arrangement.",
            "The 26-km Hong Kong Section of the XRL will connect Hong Kong to the continuously expanding national high-speed rail network, substantially reducing the rail travelling time between Hong Kong and various major Mainland cities.",
            "\"As at end-June this year, the construction works of the Hong Kong Section of the XRL were about 95 per cent complete. Train testing and trial runs, as well as preparation for the operation stage, are underway. Our target is to commission services in the third quarter of 2018,\" said Mr Chan.",
            "He continued to say that the implementation of the co-location arrangement means that passengers can complete clearance procedures of both Hong Kong and the Mainland at the WKS in one go. Passengers departing from Hong Kong can go to all cities on the national high-speed rail network without having to undergo clearance procedures again on the Mainland. On the other hand, passengers coming to Hong Kong can freely board trains at any station on the national high-speed rail network, and go through Mainland departure clearance and Hong Kong arrival clearance at the WKS. They will not be constrained by whether a particular Mainland city has clearance facilities. Without a co-location arrangement, passengers might only board or alight at Mainland stations equipped with clearance facilities.",
            "\"If a co-location arrangement was not implemented, the efficiency and flexibility offered by the XRL will be hampered. As such, a co-location arrangement is critical to fully unleash benefits of the XRL project\", said Mr Chan.",
            "The HKSAR Government and the relevant Mainland authorities conducted detailed study on the co-location arrangement to ensure that it should comply with the Basic Law; have to be feasible and effective from the operational perspective; and be able to manage security risk robustly. With reference to the case of the Shenzhen Bay Port, the HKSAR Government and the relevant central authorities recommended adopting a \"Three-step Process\" in implementing the co-location arrangement at the WKS of the XRL. The three steps may be summarised as follows –",
            "Step One: The Mainland and the HKSAR are to reach a Co-operation Arrangement in relation to the implementation of the co-location arrangement;",
            "Step Two: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress approves and endorses the Co-operation Arrangement by making a Decision; and",
            "Step Three: Both sides implement the arrangement pursuant to their respective procedures. Local legislation will be necessary for the case of Hong Kong.",
            "The contents of the Co-operation Arrangement include the establishment of port areas, the area and jurisdiction of the Mainland Port Area (MPA), immigration control on travellers, liaison and coordination mechanism and emergency handling mechanism, consultation on and resolution of disputes, as well as the arrangement for amending the Co-operation Arrangement and its effective date. With respect to the application of laws and delineation of jurisdiction, the MPA will be regarded as outside the territorial boundary of the HKSAR.",
            "Mr Yuen pointed out that the co-location arrangement is consistent with the Basic Law. The Co-operation Arrangement will provide a sound and clear legal basis for Mainland personnel to conduct clearance procedures for passengers and perform duties in the MPA.",
            "Mr Lee said, \"Law enforcement agencies of the Mainland can only undertake law enforcement within the MPA, beyond which they do not have the power to do so.\"",
            "Mr Lee added that under the co-location arrangement, an inter-departmental \"Task Force on Emergency Response and Rescue Issues\" would be established by both sides to draw up emergency and rescue plans to handle emergency incidents. Regular drills would be conducted and a liaison officer system would also be set up. Emergency incidents include fire, train failures, urgent medical assistance requested by passengers, large scale public health incidents, terrorist attacks, handling of dangerous or chemical goods, etc.",
            "As for the day-to-day operation, Mr Lee said that both sides would establish a co-operation and liaison mechanism to ensure that it is smooth, efficient and safe, such as in combatting smuggling and managing the peak periods of boundary crossing.",
            "There are examples of similar co-location arrangement overseas, such as that between the United Kingdom and France, and that between the United States and Canada. Hong Kong and the Mainland have also adopted such an arrangement at the Shenzhen Bay Port since 2007. It has been operating smoothly and has been well received by travellers. The Government hopes that the community can support the implementation of the co-location arrangement for the XRL, so as to benefit passengers from Hong Kong and across the globe in future.",

            "政府今日（七月二十五日）公布有關廣深港高速鐵路（廣深港高鐵）在西九龍站進行香港及內地的清關、出入境及檢疫手續（通關程序）的安排（一地兩檢）。有關安排已於同日獲行政長官會同行政會議通過。",
            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師、運輸及房屋局局長陳帆和保安局局長李家超於政府總部舉行記者會，解釋一地兩檢安排。",
            "廣深港高鐵（香港段）全長廿六公里，會把香港連接至不斷擴大的國家高鐵網絡，大大縮短由香港以鐵路往來內地各主要城市的時間。",
            "陳帆說：「截至今年六月底，廣深港高鐵（香港段）工程已完成接近九成半，現正密鑼緊鼓地進行列車測試和試運行，以及為營運安排作好準備。我們的目標是於二零一八年第三季通車。」",
            "他續指，落實一地兩檢，意味乘客能在西九龍站一次過辦理香港和內地的通關程序。離港乘客登車後，就能安坐列車到達國家高鐵網絡所有城市，不需要再在內地接受入境檢查；另一方面，返港乘客亦可自由選擇在國家高鐵網絡任何一個內地車站登車，抵達西九龍站才辦理內地出境和香港入境等通關程序，不受內地車站是否設有通關口岸限制。如果沒有一地兩檢，乘客只能在設有通關口岸的內地車站上下車。",
            "陳帆說：「如果不實行一地兩檢，廣深港高鐵將失去其高效靈活的功能。一地兩檢是發揮廣深港高鐵項目最大效益的首要關鍵。」",
            "特區政府一直與中央有關部門就一地兩檢進行詳細研究，以確保方案符合《基本法》；在運作上可行有效，並能有效處理保安風險。雙方參考深圳灣口岸模式後達成共識，建議採用「三步走」的方式於廣深港高鐵西九龍站實施一地兩檢。該三步可簡述如下：",
            "第一步：由內地與香港特區達成落實一地兩檢的合作安排（《合作安排》）；",
            "第二步：全國人民代表大會常務委員會通過決定批准及確認《合作安排》；及",
            "第三步：兩地各自進行相關程序予以實施；在香港方面將涉及本地立法工作。",
            "《合作安排》的內容包括口岸區的設立、「內地口岸區」的範圍及管轄權事宜、對旅客出入境監管、聯絡協調與應急處理機制、爭議的磋商及解決，以及《合作安排》的修改和生效事宜。就內地法律和香港特區法律的適用及管轄權（包括司法管轄權）的劃分，「內地口岸區」將視為香港特區區域範圍之外。",
            "袁國強指出，一地兩檢安排符合《基本法》。《合作安排》將提供穩固清晰的法律基礎，讓內地人員在「內地口岸區」為乘客辦理通關程序及執行職務。",
            "李家超說：「在內地口岸區內的內地執法機關，只可以在內地口岸區執法，在內地口岸區以外是沒有執法權的。」",
            "李家超說，在一地兩檢運作之下，兩地成立跨部門「應急救援事宜專責小組」，有關單位合作制訂緊急及救援預案，處理緊急事故，定期演練；建立兩地聯絡員制度。緊急事故包括：火警、列車故障、乘客急需醫療協助、大型公共衞生事故、恐怖襲擊及危險品或化學品的處理等。",
            "李家超表示，針對日常運作，兩地設立協作聯絡機制，確保運作暢順、高效和安全，例如打擊走私、過關高峰期管理。",
            "一地兩檢在國際上早有先例，例如在英、法之間及美、加之間亦有類似安排，而香港與內地之間也於二○○七年起在深圳灣口岸實施一地兩檢，經驗十分正面，為旅客所肯定。政府期望社會各界支持廣深港高鐵落實一地兩檢，讓日後來自香港和世界各地的乘客受惠。",
