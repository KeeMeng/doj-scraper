            "A spokesman for the Department of Justice said today (March 15) that no further action is warranted regarding the traffic complaint lodged by a magazine reporter in December 2012 alleging the contravention of traffic laws by a member of the Central Policy Unit, Ms Sophia Kao Ching-chi.",
            "The spokesman said that the complainant, a reporter for a local magazine, provided a photograph when making the complaint. As the reporter filing the complaint declined to make a statement and the senior management of the magazine in question declined to assist, the Police could not obtain any further evidence regarding the authenticity of the photograph or further details about the incident and the circumstances in which the photograph was taken. Accordingly, it is not possible to ascertain the exact circumstances of the incident, nor will there be any witness willing to testify even if the matter is brought before a court. The driver of a coach which was depicted in the photograph and behind Ms Kao's vehicle did not recall anything of significance having taken place. In view of the lack of sufficient evidence, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Mr Kevin Zervos, SC, after carefully considering the matter according to established legal principles and The Statement of Prosecution Policy and Practice, concluded that no further action was warranted.",
            "In December 2012, a reporter from a local magazine sent a photograph to the Police and complained that Ms Kao was driving dangerously as she crossed continuous double white lines when a coach was behind her vehicle at a very close distance. The photograph showed Ms Kao's vehicle straddling continuous double white lines. It appears to be momentary and it is hard to ascertain the distance of the coach behind the vehicle. After completing an investigation, the Police sought legal advice from the Department of Justice.",
            "The Secretary for Justice, in order to avoid any possible perception of bias or improper influence, after satisfying himself that the DPP had no connection with any person involved in the case, delegated to the DPP the authority to handle the case, including considering whether any prosecution action was warranted.",

            "律政司發言人今日（三月十五日）表示，有關一名雜誌記者在二○一二年十二月就中央政策組顧問高靜芝涉嫌違反交通法例作出的投訴，律政司決定不需採取進一步行動。",
            "發言人表示，該名作出投訴的本地雜誌記者，在投訴時提供了一張照片。由於該記者拒絕作供，而有關雜誌的管理層亦拒絕提供協助，警方未能就照片的真確性取得進一步證據，亦未能獲取更多關於該次事件和拍攝照片時的情況的詳細資料。在這情況下，不可能查清該事件的確實發生情況；即使將事件送交法院處理亦不會有證人出庭作供。該照片顯示高靜芝的汽車後面有一輛旅遊巴士，但該旅遊巴士的司機記不起有任何重大事情發生。由於缺乏足夠證據，刑事檢控專員薛偉成資深大律師按照既定的法律原則及《檢控政策及常規》，經仔細考慮事件後，決定不需採取進一步行動。",
            "在二○一二年十二月，一名本地雜誌記者把一張照片送交警方，投訴高靜芝危險駕駛，指她在一輛旅遊巴士緊隨其後時越過連續雙白線。該照片顯示高靜芝的汽車跨越連續雙白線行駛，這情況似乎只維持短暫時間，而且亦難以確定該汽車與後面的旅遊巴士之間的距離。警方完成調查後向律政司尋求法律意見。",
            "為免可能產生偏頗和不當影響的印象，律政司司長在信納刑事檢控專員與涉及此案的任何人士沒有關連後，已授權刑事檢控專員處理該案，包括考慮是否應作出檢控。",
