            "The following is issued on behalf of the Law Reform Commission:",
            "The Law Reform Commission (LRC) released a report today (October 12) recommending that the law should be amended to clarify the law concerning third party funding of arbitration and associated proceedings under the Arbitration Ordinance, with appropriate safeguards in place.",
            "The proposed reforms are necessary to enhance Hong Kong's competitive position as an international arbitration centre.",
            "The report follows a study by the LRC's Third Party Funding for Arbitration Sub-committee, chaired by Ms Kim Rooney, which issued a consultation paper in October 2015. The responses to that paper have been taken into account in formulating the final recommendations in the report.",
            "The common law principles of maintenance and champerty have been held by the Hong Kong courts to continue to apply in Hong Kong and to prohibit third party funding of litigation, both as a tort and as a criminal offence, save in three exceptional areas: (1) where a third party has a legitimate interest in the outcome of the litigation; (2) where a party should be permitted to obtain third party funding, so as to enable him/her to have access to justice; and (3) in a miscellaneous recognised category of proceedings including insolvency proceedings. The question of whether the operation of the common law principles of maintenance and champerty also apply to third party funding for arbitration taking place in Hong Kong was expressly left open by the Court of Final Appeal in 2007 in the case of Unruh v Seeberger (2007) 10 HKCFAR 31.",
            "The report recommends that the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) should be amended to state that the common law principles of maintenance and champerty (both as to civil and criminal liability) do not apply to arbitration and associated proceedings under the Arbitration Ordinance. The amendment of the law to permit third party funding of arbitration should apply also to the funding of services provided in Hong Kong for arbitrations taking place outside Hong Kong. However, third party funding provided either directly or indirectly by a person practising law or providing legal services should not be permitted.",
            "The LRC's Secretary, Ms Michelle Ainsworth, said that the LRC considers that a party with a good case in law should not be deprived of the financial support it needs to pursue that case by arbitration and associated proceedings under the Arbitration Ordinance, and that these reforms are necessary to enhance Hong Kong's competitive position as an international arbitration centre.",
            "Another key recommendation in the report is that clear standards for third party funders operating in Hong Kong should be developed. The LRC recommends, the adoption of a \"light touch\" approach to the regulation of third party funding of arbitration in Hong Kong for an initial period of three years.",
            "The report recommends that third party funders funding arbitration should be required to comply with a Code of Practice to be issued by a body authorized under the Arbitration Ordinance after consultation with the public. The Code should set out the standards and practices which third party funders will ordinarily be expected to comply with, generally and in their arbitration funding agreements. These standards and practices include that the third party funder's promotional literature must be clear and not misleading, that their funding agreements should set out and explain clearly the key features, risks and terms of the agreement and that the third party funder must take reasonable steps to ensure that the funded party receives independent legal advice on the terms of the funding agreement before signing it.",
            "The report recommends that, following the coming into effect of the proposed amendment to the Ordinance, the Advisory Committee on the Promotion of Arbitration should be nominated by the Secretary for Justice to be the Advisory Body to monitor the conduct of third party funding for arbitration and the implementation of the Code, and to liaise with stakeholders.",
            "After the conclusion of the first three years of operation of the Code, the Advisory Body should issue a report reviewing its operation and make recommendations as to the updating of the ethical and financial standards set out in it.",
            "The report further recommends that consideration should be given as to whether such non-application of the common law principles of maintenance and champerty should be extended to mediation within the scope of the Mediation Ordinance (Cap 620).",
            "On the issue of security for costs, the LRC considers that there is no need to give an arbitral tribunal the power to order security for costs against a third party funder, as the powers of an arbitral tribunal under the Arbitration Ordinance to order a party to give security for costs afford adequate protection.",
            "Copies of the report are available on request from the Secretariat of the Law Reform Commission at 4/F Justice Place, East Wing, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central, Hong Kong. The report can also be accessed on the website of the LRC at",

            "法律改革委員會（法改會）今日（十月十二日）發表報告書，建議應修訂法律，述明准許第三方資助《仲裁條例》下的仲裁及相關法律程序，並須符合適當的保障規定。",
            "有關建議改革旨在加強香港作為國際仲裁中心的競爭力。",
            "本報告書是繼法改會第三方資助仲裁小組委員會所進行的研究而撰寫的。小組委員會由甘婉玲擔任主席，曾於二○一五年十月發表諮詢文件。在訂定報告書的最終建議時，諮詢文件的回應意見已予考慮。",
            "香港法院曾裁定普通法下的助訟及包攬訴訟法則繼續適用於香港，即第三方資助訴訟同屬侵權行為及刑事罪行而須予禁止，但有三種例外情況：（一）第三方對訴訟結果有合法權益；（二）當事方應獲准取得第三方資助，使其可有尋求公義的渠道；及（三）獲認可的雜項類別法律程序（包括無力償債法律程序）。至於助訟及包攬訴訟法則是否亦適用於在香港進行的第三方資助仲裁，終審法院於二○○七年在Unruh v Seeberger (2007) 10 HKCFAR 31一案中，表明對相關問題不下定論。",
            "報告書建議，《仲裁條例》（第609章）應予修訂，述明普通法的助訟及包攬訴訟法則（在民事及刑事法律責任兩方面）不適用於《仲裁條例》下的仲裁及相關法律程序。准許第三方資助仲裁的法律修訂，亦應適用於為在香港以外地方進行的仲裁而在香港提供的服務所作出的資助。然而，由從事法律執業或提供法律服務的人直接或間接提供的第三方資助，則不應在准許之列。",
            "法改會秘書長顏倩華表示，法改會認為不應剝奪有充分法律理據的當事方藉透過《仲裁條例》下的仲裁及相關法律程序進行追討而需要的財務支援，並且認為須進行有關改革，以加強香港作為國際仲裁中心的競爭力。",
            "報告書的另一項主要建議，是應為在香港營運的第三方出資者訂定清晰的標準。法改會建議在為期三年的初段期間，採用「輕力度」模式規管在香港進行的第三方資助仲裁。",
            "報告書建議，應規定資助仲裁的第三方出資者須遵從由根據《仲裁條例》獲授權的機構在諮詢公眾後所發出的《實務守則》。《實務守則》應列明通常預期第三方出資者在一般情況及其仲裁資助協議中須予遵從的標準和實務指引。這些標準和實務指引包括以下條文：第三方出資者的推廣刊物必須清晰及不具誤導性；其資助協議應列出及清楚解釋有關協議的特點、風險及條款；以及第三方出資者必須採取合理步驟，確保受資助方在資助協議簽立之前已就有關協議的條款取得獨立的法律意見。",
            "報告書建議，在《仲裁條例》的建議修訂條文生效後，仲裁推廣諮詢委員會應獲律政司司長指定為諮詢機構，負責監察第三方資助仲裁的運作及《實務守則》的實施情況，並聯繋持份者。",
            "在實施《實務守則》的首三年期結束後，諮詢機構應發表檢討《實務守則》實施情況的報告書，並就所列載的專業操守標準及財務標準作出更新建議。",
            "報告書又建議，考慮是否規定普通法的助訟及包攬訴訟法則亦應不適用於《調解條例》（第620章）適用範圍內的調解。",
            "在費用保證的議題方面，法改會認為無需賦予仲裁庭命令第三方出資者提供費用保證的權力，理由是仲裁庭根據《仲裁條例》命令某方提供費用保證的權力已可提供足夠保障。",
            "公眾人士可往香港中環下亞厘畢道18號律政中心東座4樓法律改革委員會秘書處索取報告書的文本，亦可於法改會的網站閱覽其內容，網址是",
