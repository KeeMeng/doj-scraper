            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at a media session after attending the opening ceremony of Prosecution Week 2016 today (June 17):",
            "Reporter: Do you mean actually the so-called \"special force\" that Lam Wing-kee has mentioned has actually breached the law and are you going to do anything to try to find out who are they? And secondly, how are you going to ease the public concern over the \"one country, two systems\" has been eroded already?",
            "Secretary for Justice: To take your several questions one by one. First of all, the so-called \"special unit\". I am not in a position to comment whether there is in fact such a \"special unit\" because I have seen, or at least from the media, that there seems to be different views and suggestions about whether or not there is the existence of this \"special unit\" or whether the case in fact actually involved a \"special unit\", so I cannot comment on these specific details. But in any event, I think as I was saying just now in Cantonese that in the context of \"one country, two systems\" principle, I think there're two sides to this concept. One side is if one person is within the jurisdiction of Mainland China, as in any other jurisdiction, one is expected to comply with the law and subject to the law of Mainland China. On the other hand, people in Hong Kong, when they are physically in Hong Kong, they are perfectly entitled to all the legal protections that are conferred by the laws of Hong Kong, including those under the Basic Law, as well as the provisions in the Bill of Rights Ordinance. So whether or not there is any breach of the law in Mainland China, I think it's a matter we'd like to look into, or matter as to exactly what happened including the questions that you asked, is something that we'd love to find out to know more about this case, because as I was saying in Cantonese just now, the Government of the Hong Kong SAR fully appreciates the concern of the people of Hong Kong over this incident. We are also very concerned and that's why from the time we became aware of this matter, not just from last night, we have been trying to look into this matter. And as we said in the statement issued last night, the Police will try to contact Mr Lam to find out exactly what happened because it's unfortunate that some of the matters which he said yesterday at the press conference were only revealed for the first time. Previously it wasn't revealed, so obviously there's a need for the Police to follow up with the matter and contact him so as to get more information and to find out exactly what has happened before we can decide, or we can even suggest, what had been done or what should be done.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月十七日）出席2016年檢控週開幕禮後，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "律政司司長：各位記者朋友，多謝大家出席今天這個檢控週的活動。",
            "記者︰昨日林榮基先生說他由內地回來香港，但過程中，他說其實李波是之前被一些人非法地帶走，你覺得會否存在一些跨境執法的問題，影響了「一國兩制」呢？",
            "律政司司長：我們特區政府，包括律政司，當然是非常關注這事件，所以昨日我們當然亦有留意林先生那個新聞會（記者會），但我想在考慮到這件事究竟對「一國兩制」有沒有影響時，我相信可能大家要比較全面些去考慮這件事，就是說，「一國兩制」的落實一定需要雙方的了解和雙方的尊重。換言之，若在內地真的有人違反了內地法律，是應該跟內地的司法制度去處理。相反來說，若在香港的話，香港人的所有法律權利，包括所有涉及刑事司法程序的權利，亦應得到尊重。今日我留意到，似乎李波先生亦發表了一些講話，似乎他的說法與林先生的說法有出入，所以我想現階段很難評論一些具體的細節。但正如昨晚政府發表的新聞稿，第一，我們關注事件，第二，我們會繼續跟進。我了解，警方已經嘗試聯絡林先生。我們亦如大家一樣，很希望可以知道事件究竟發生甚麼事。因為我們特區政府往後一定會盡力維護「一國兩制」，維護香港人的權益，及我們法律上的權利。",
            "記者：林榮基在內地被扣押這麼久，內地政府一直沒有按通報機制向香港通報這件事，其實是不是反映兩地的通報機制已經失效呢？",
            "律政司司長：通報機制方面，以往黎（棟國）局長亦有回答過，因為機制方面不是律政司負責，我亦不可以掌握相關的詳細情況，所以我想我不方便具體評論有關該通報機制。我相信無論我們說通報機制也好，或其他機制以外的事情也好，若特區政府知道香港人在內地發生事故，需要幫助，特區政府無論是入境處或其他部門，都一定會盡我們可以做到的事情，提供我們可以提供的協助。",
            "記者：如果內地人員押香港人回來是否違反「一國兩制」？",
            "律政司司長：你的意思是否如有人違法或是……我不太明白你的問題。",
            "記者：即是林榮基先生他是被內地人員「押回來」香港，這個行動是否違反了「一國兩制」？",
            "律政司司長：我想要視乎你所說的「押回來」是甚麼意思。若是一個有權利回來香港，例如有居港權的香港人，他有權回來香港的話，他自己回來香港是絕對沒問題。至於有沒有人陪同他，而這些陪同的人士做甚麼才構成違法，這一定是跟香港的法例。這方面香港特區政府的立場是非常清晰，只有香港的執法人員才有權在香港執法，任何其他國家的執法人員若要在香港執法，除非根據香港一些司法互助的協議，否則任何其他執法人員在香港絕對無權執法，特區政府亦不會容許或縱容這些執法行為。所以若我們知道有些違法的執法行為的話，律政司或特區的其他政府部門是會跟進相關事項。謝謝。",
