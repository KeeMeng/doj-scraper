            "Organised by the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice, the Prosecution Week 2015 was kicked off today (June 23) with the objective of enhancing community awareness of the rule of law and citizens' civil rights and duties, under the theme \"Uphold Justice with Professionalism and Independence\".",
            "Speaking at the event's opening ceremony, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said that the environment of Hong Kong as a whole is undergoing significant changes, and so is the legal landscape of Hong Kong as well as the environment within which our public prosecutors have to perform their duties.",
            "\"These changes bring about huge challenges to our law enforcement agencies as well as our public prosecutors, if not the entire Department of Justice. For instance, the advance of technology has brought about challenges to our substantive criminal law as well as generated complex and difficult issues in the context of criminal evidence and criminal procedure. The upsurge of cross-border or multi-jurisdictional criminal activities, on the other hand, calls for better co-operation amongst different jurisdictions.",
            "\"Another challenge is how to engage the general public, so as to provide them with the appropriate explanations within the limit permitted by the law and which would best serve public interests,\" Mr Yuen said.",
            "The Director of Public Prosecution, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, said at the same occasion that this year's theme has summarised two fundamental principles which the Prosecutions Division held dear in the pursuit of criminal justice.",
            "\"Before we decide whether or not to prosecute in any given case, we must carefully and critically evaluate all the available evidence. Unless we are satisfied that the evidence supports a reasonable prospect of success, there can be no prosecution. And once we are so satisfied, we proceed to consider whether the public interest requires the prosecution to be brought. And at all time, we guide ourselves by the law, international standards, all applicable practice, and our Prosecution Code.",
            "\"In carrying out our duty to prosecute, we strive to ensure that the rights of all parties to the criminal proceedings are always sufficiently safeguarded. It is this high degree of professionalism on the part of the prosecutors that help ensure the maintenance of a fair criminal justice system as we know it, and ultimately the rule of law.",
            "\"Article 63 of the Basic Law preserves the primacy of prosecutorial independence by providing a constitutionally entrenched guarantee that the Department of Justice shall control criminal prosecutions 'free from any interference'. It is on this foundation that each of us as prosecutor is expected to carry out our duties, without being subservient to anyone however rich or powerful,\" Mr Yeung said.",
            "During the week from June 24 to 30, visits to the Department of Justice and courts, talks and mock court will be organised to enhance public understanding of the criminal justice system and the works of Public Prosecutors.",
            "A slogan competition for the Prosecution Week was also organised with a total of 364 entries submitted by secondary school students. The prize presentation was also held at today's ceremony.",

            "由律政司刑事檢控科主辦的2015年檢控週今日（六月二十三日）展開。這項活動的主題為「公義路上，專業獨立」，旨在加強公眾人士對法治及公民權利和責任的認識。",
            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師在開幕禮上表示，香港的整體環境，包括香港的法律環境，以及檢控人員執行職務的環境，正有著重大的轉變。",
            "他說：「這些轉變為我們的執法機構及檢控人員帶來巨大的挑戰，即使不是整個律政司也受影響。舉例說，科技的進步為我們重要的刑事法例帶來不少挑戰，並在刑事證據及刑事程序方面產生不少複雜和困難的問題。另一方面，跨境或跨司法管轄區刑事活動的上升，亦需要不同司法管轄區加強合作。」",
            "「另一項挑戰是如何加強市民的參與，在法律容許的範圍及符合公眾的最大利益下，向市民提供適當的解釋。」",
            "在同一場合，刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師表示，今年的主題正好說明了刑事檢控科在伸張刑事司法公義的道路上極為重視的兩項基本原則。",
            "他說：「我們決定是否就某宗案件進行檢控前，必須小心審慎地衡量所有所得證據。除非我們信納證據充分，支持有合理機會達至定罪，否則不會提出檢控。而一旦我們信納證據充分，會進而考慮為公眾利益是否需要提出檢控。我們時刻都以法律、國際標準、所有適用慣例和我們的《檢控守則》作為指引行事。」",
            "他說：「我們履行檢控職責時，致力確保刑事法律程序中各方的權利時刻得到充分保障。我們得以維持公正的刑事司法制度，並秉行法治，實有賴檢控人員這高度專業精神。」",
            "他說：「《基本法》第六十三條訂明，律政司主管刑事檢察工作，『不受任何干涉』，這是在憲法層面確立的保證，藉此維持檢控獨立的重要地位。正是在這基礎上，我們全體檢控人員在執行職務時，不會屈從於任何人，不管有關人士如何財雄勢大。」",
            "由六月二十四日至三十日的活動期，將會舉辦講座、模擬法庭，及參觀律政司和法庭，以提高公眾人士對刑事司法制度和刑事檢控工作的認識。",
            "早前刑事檢控科亦舉辦了檢控週的標語創作比賽，共接獲364份中學生的參賽作品，頒獎儀式亦於今日的開幕禮上舉行。",
