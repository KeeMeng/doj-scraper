            "Delivering a keynote speech at the Business Awards Gala Dinner organised by the Hong Kong Australia Business Association (Victoria Chapter), Mr Yuen said that Hong Kong continues the traditions of the common law and the important notion of the rule of law including an independent judiciary, both of which are the key features constitutionally entrenched in the Basic Law.",
            "“Our Court of Final Appeal (CFA) comprises not only the best judicial talents from within Hong Kong, but also top jurists from other common law jurisdictions including Australia. Indeed, since 1997, seven leading jurists from Australia have been appointed as non-permanent judges on our CFA,” he said.",
            "Mr Yuen noted around 550 Australian companies are based in Hong Kong, and a further 1,000 Australian companies have offices in Hong Kong.",
            "“The robustness of our legal system, the independence of our judiciary, as well as our strict adherence to the rule of law have provided a solid bedrock for a business environment which is both friendly and effective for businessmen and investors, including our friends from Australia,” he said.",
