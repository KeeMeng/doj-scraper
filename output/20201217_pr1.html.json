            "The following is issued on behalf of the Law Reform Commission:",
            "The Outcome Related Fee Structures for Arbitration Sub-committee of the Law Reform Commission (Sub-committee) published a consultation paper on Outcome Related Fee Structures for Arbitration today (December 17) to launch a three-month public consultation.",
            "The Sub-committee recommends that the law in Hong Kong be amended to permit lawyers to use outcome related fee structures (ORFSs) for arbitration taking place in and outside Hong Kong. It also invites public views on appropriate safeguards to be put in place in the professional codes of conduct and in subsidiary legislation.",
            "Co-chair of the Sub-committee, Ms Kathryn Sanger, said in a press conference that the recommendations are made with the objective of preserving and promoting Hong Kong as a leading centre for arbitration services, and to enable Hong Kong to compete on an even playing field with other popular arbitral seats which allow some form of ORFSs.",
            "In the consultation paper, ORFS refers to an agreement between a lawyer and client, whereby the lawyer receives a financial benefit if the case is won. It includes several types of agreements, namely conditional fee agreements (CFAs), damages-based agreements (DBAs) and hybrid damages-based agreements (Hybrid DBAs).",
            "Ms Sanger said that there are two forms of CFA. One form is a \"no win, no fee\" arrangement where the lawyer charges no fee during the course of the proceedings and is paid his or her usual fee plus an uplift if the client's case succeeds. Another form is a \"no win, low fee\" arrangement where the lawyer charges at the usual rate or at a discounted rate during the course of the proceedings, plus a success fee if the client's case succeeds. For these two forms of arrangements, a success fee refers to an additional fee that the client agrees to pay the lawyer only upon the success of the case. It can be an agreed flat fee, or calculated as a percentage \"uplift\" on the fee charged during the course of the proceedings.",
            "As for a DBA, it is a form of \"no win, no fee\" arrangement. If the client's case is unsuccessful, the lawyer charges no fee. In the event of success, under a DBA, the lawyer's fee is calculated by reference to the outcome of the proceedings, for example as a percentage of the amount awarded or recovered (DBA Payment).",
            "A Hybrid DBA is a form of \"no win, low fee\" arrangement. The lawyer charges a fee for the legal services rendered (typically at a discounted rate) and, in the event of success, the DBA Payment.",
            "At present, ORFSs are unlawful for litigation and arbitration proceedings in Hong Kong. However, major arbitral seats permit some form of ORFSs and there is significant and increasing demand from clients for such an arrangement.",
            "Ms Sanger said that the Sub-committee has reviewed the current position relating to ORFSs for arbitration and considered that reform is required. The consultation paper sets out the Sub-committee's recommendations for reform, including its proposals for amending the relevant laws and regulations.",
            "She said that the Sub-committee has studied the legal regimes and experiences of a number of other jurisdictions, including Singapore, England and Wales, Australia, Mainland China and the United States. The Sub-committee has also made reference to the Law Reform Commission's previous study of conditional fees for proceedings (including arbitration) between 2003 and 2007, as well as third-party funding for arbitration between 2013 and 2016.",
            "Apart from recommending removing the prohibition on the use of ORFSs for arbitration for lawyers, the Sub-committee also makes recommendations on the operation of individual regimes relating to CFAs, DBAs and Hybrid DBAs.",
            "For instance, the Sub-committee recommends that a cap should be placed on the success fees for the CFA regime as well as the DBA Payment for the DBA and Hybrid DBA regimes respectively.",
            "The Sub-committee also invites submissions on various aspects such as whether personal injury claims should be treated differently from other claims in arbitration and whether any additional category/categories of claim should be treated differently from other claims that are submitted to arbitration if ORFSs for arbitration are introduced.",
            "The Sub-committee welcomes views, comments and suggestions on any issues discussed in the consultation paper. All views should be submitted on or before March 16, 2021, to: The Secretary, Outcome Related Fee Structures for Arbitration Sub-committee, Law Reform Commission, by mail (4/F, East Wing, Justice Place, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central), by fax (3918 4096) or by email (hklrc@hkreform.gov.hk).",
            "The consultation paper and the executive summary can also be accessed on the Commission's website at www.hkreform.gov.hk. Hard copies of the consultation paper are also available on request from the Secretariat of the Law Reform Commission at the above address.",

            "法律改革委員會（法改會）轄下的與仲裁結果有關的收費架構小組委員會今日（十二月十七日）發表《與仲裁結果有關的收費架構》諮詢文件，展開為期三個月的公眾諮詢。",
            "小組委員會建議，應修訂香港法律，准許律師就在香港及在香港以外地方進行的仲裁採用與結果有關的收費架構。小組委員會亦邀請公眾，對專業行為守則及附屬法例應訂立的適當保障措施發表意見。",
            "小組委員會聯合主席張清明在記者會表示，作出建議的目的，是為了維持及推廣香港作為主要仲裁服務中心，並讓香港可在公平環境下，與其他容許某種形式與結果有關的收費架構的熱門仲裁地競爭。",
            "諮詢文件中，與結果有關的收費架構指律師與當事人訂立的協議，根據該協議，律師在案件成功時收取財務利益。該收費架構包括幾種協議，即按條件收費協議、按損害賠償收費協議，以及混合式按損害賠償收費協議。",
            "張清明稱按條件收費協議有兩種。一種是「不成功、不收費」的安排，律師在法律程序過程中不收取費用，如當事人的案件成功，律師方獲支付其一般費用，另加一筆額外收費。另一種是「不成功、低收費」的安排，律師在法律程序過程中按慣常收費率或折扣收費率收取費用，如當事人的案件成功，則加收成功收費。就這兩種安排而言，成功收費指當事人同意只在案件成功時才向律師支付的額外費用，其數額可以是雙方議定的固定金額，也可以按法律程序過程中所收取費用的某個百分比額外計算。",
            "至於按損害賠償收費協議，則是一種「不成功、不收費」的安排。如當事人的案件敗訴，律師不收取費用。如當事人獲得勝訴，根據按損害賠償收費協議，律師的收費參照法律程序的結果計算，例如按所獲判給或討回的款額的某個百分比計算（按損害賠償收費協議費用）。",
            "混合式按損害賠償收費協議是一種「不成功、低收費」的安排。律師就所提供的法律服務收取費用（一般按折扣收費率收取），並在當事人獲得勝訴時另再收取按損害賠償收費協議費用。",
            "目前，在香港就訴訟程序和仲裁程序採用與結果有關的收費架構並不合法。不過，主要仲裁地均准許某種形式的與結果有關的收費架構，而當事人對此等安排的需求也很大並持續增加。",
            "張清明表示，小組委員會已檢視現時與仲裁結果有關的收費架構，並認為需要進行改革。諮詢文件載有小組委員會的改革建議，包括修訂相關法律和規管架構的提議。",
            "她說小組委員會研究了多個其他司法管轄區的法律制度和經驗，包括新加坡、英格蘭及威爾斯、澳大利亞、中國內地及美國。小組委員會還參考了法改會先前在二○○三年至二○○七年間就法律程序（包括仲裁）引入按條件收費的研究，以及在二○一三年至二○一六年間有關第三者資助仲裁的研究。",
            "小組委員會除了建議應撤銷對律師於仲裁採用與結果有關的收費架構的禁止規定外，也就按條件收費協議、按損害賠償收費協議及混合式按損害賠償收費協議的個別機制應如何運作，作出建議。",
            "舉例來說，小組委員會建議，應為按條件收費協議機制的成功收費設定上限，並為按損害賠償收費協議機制與混合式按損害賠償收費協議機制的按損害賠償收費協議費用設定上限。",
            "小組委員會亦邀請公眾就多個方面提交意見書，例如應否對人身傷害申索作出與其他仲裁申索不同的處理，以及如引入與仲裁結果有關的收費架構的話，是否有額外類別的申索應採取與其他提交仲裁的申索不同的方式處理。",
            "小組委員會歡迎各界對諮詢文件中討論的議題提出意見、評論及建議。所有意見請於二○二一年三月十六日或之前以郵遞（中環下亞厘畢道18號律政中心東座4樓）、傳真（3918 4096）或電郵（hklrc@hkreform.gov.hk）送達法改會與仲裁結果有關的收費架構小組委員會秘書。",
