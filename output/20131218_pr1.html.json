            "In response to media enquires about a case in which a reporter was allegedly attacked by a man, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said today (December 18) that the decision not to charge the man was made by the department after careful consideration of all available evidence.",
            "As laid down in the Prosecution Code, the decision whether or not to prosecute depends on two key elements: (1) whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a reasonable prospect of conviction, and (2) whether it is in the public interest to prosecute. In the present case, the first requirement is not satisfied, the spokesman said.",
            "The allegations against the man were that he pushed a news reporter to the ground and that the man then kicked the reporter while she was lying on the ground.",
            "The Department of Justice has carefully and repeatedly reviewed the incident as captured in two available video clips taken by the public media, both at normal speed and in slow motion. The situation as seen from the video clips does not support the allegations.",
            "Further, the Department of Justice has also carefully considered the statements given by all the witnesses in conjunction with the video clips. There are discrepancies between the witnesses' accounts and the clips. Such discrepancies further adversely affect the prospect of conviction should any prosecution be initiated.",
            "The spokesman reiterated that the department fully respects freedom of the press and is committed to its protection in accordance with the laws. The department is also fully committed to the protection of the security and safety of all persons, including reporters, in accordance with the laws. However, while this case involves a news reporter, the case should nevertheless be handled in the same way as other criminal complaints.",
            "The department notes that reference has been made this morning by the reporter to another event in which she was assaulted while carrying out her journalistic duties at Sheung Shui. The two assailants in that case have indeed been prosecuted and convicted of common assault. That case has been concluded. The spokesman said that each case should be considered on its own facts.",

            "律政司發言人今日（十二月十八日）在回應傳媒查詢時表示，就決定不起訴一名男子被指襲擊記者一事，律政司是在仔細審視所有證據後作出的決定。",
            "發言人指出，正如《檢控守則》規定，作出檢控決定前必須考慮兩項因素：（一）是否有充分證據，支持有合理機會達致定罪；及（二）檢控是否合符公眾利益。這案件並不符合以上第一項檢控準則。",
            "該男子被指將一名記者推倒，並用腳踢該名躺在地上的記者。",

            "發言人重申，律政司完全尊重及致力依法捍新聞自由，並全力保障所有市民（包括記者）的安全受法律保護。然而，縱使本案涉及一名記者，律政司亦須一視同仁，以處理其他刑事投訴的同一準則處理本案。",
            "律政司留意到今早有報道提及該名記者曾在上水履行記者職務時被襲擊。該兩名襲擊者已被檢控，並裁定普通襲擊罪成。該案亦已完結。此外，每宗案件必須就本身的具體案情處理。完",
