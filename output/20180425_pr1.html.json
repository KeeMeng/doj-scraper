            "The following is issued on behalf of the Law Reform Commission:",
            "A sub-committee of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) released a consultation paper today (April 25) to invite public views on whether the court should be given, by way of legislation, the power to make periodical payment orders (PPOs) in respect of damages for future pecuniary loss in personal injury cases.",
            "The Chairman of the Periodical Payments for Future Pecuniary Loss in Personal Injury Cases Sub-committee, Mr Raymond Leung, SC, said in a press conference that the purpose of the consultation paper is to identify the problems of the current law and practices in assessing damages, in particular future pecuniary losses in personal injury cases.",
            "\"This is for the purpose of considering whether reform is needed to allow periodical payments for future pecuniary loss to be awarded, and if so, to make recommendations for reform as appropriate,\" Mr Leung said.",
            "He said that the Sub-committee has studied the experiences of other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries, the United States and Singapore to provide guidance on the consideration as to the desirability and viability of introducing relevant legislation for Hong Kong.",
            "The Sub-committee wishes to highlight different aspects of concern and to gauge the sentiment of the public and stakeholders on the issues involved by inviting comments on several open-ended questions.",
            "In the consultation paper, the Sub-committee invites the opinion of the public as to whether there is a need for a mechanism to set the discount rate at appropriate periods inclusive of who or which authority should be empowered to set the discount rate. Public views on whether the Chief Justice or any other person or body should be empowered to fix this discount rate and to conduct periodic revision of such rate are also sought.",
            "Under current law in Hong Kong, a lump sum award is made at the time of trial to compensate for a continuing stream of income, which would otherwise have to be earned in the future if the injury had not been sustained, and to cover a continuing stream of expenditure to be incurred in the future as necessitated by the injury.",
            "The court must assess damages once and for all in a lump sum, save in those cases that qualify for an award of provisional damages. Damages for future pecuniary losses may be awarded on the same basis as damages for past pecuniary losses, that is, restitutio in integrum or full compensation for the loss.",
            "\"This is a difficult task for the courts, as any assessment of damages for future pecuniary loss must consider what a plaintiff might have earned but for the injury, the earning capacity of the plaintiff after the injury and any additional expenses incurred following the injury. The assessment of damages must also be done as a lump sum which is not susceptible to review in the future,\" Mr Leung said.",
            "He added that this conventional approach brings the inevitable problem that the lump sum award for future pecuniary loss is either too little or too much, and has been generally criticised as being imprecise and unscientific.",
            "Another important question relating to periodical payments is the viability and desirability of a mechanism for fixing and reviewing the presumed rate of return on investment to be applied in assessment of damages in personal injury cases. The discount of the lump sum award is made in respect of income and expenditure that would only arise in the future. The measure of the discount is the presumed rate of return, which can reasonably be expected on that sum of damages if invested in such a way as to enable the plaintiff to meet the whole amount of the loss during the entire period.",
            "In addition, the Sub-committee has considered the desirability of having a mechanism for allowing the dependants of a recipient of periodical payments to lodge a claim for \"loss of dependency\" where the recipient dies prematurely (i.e. during the remainder of the estimated working life which has been shortened by the injury in respect whereof the defendant is liable).",
            "The major question to be consulted is whether, as a matter of principle and notwithstanding the need for further exploration as to various aspects of operational feasibility, the court should be given, by way of legislation, the power to make periodical payment orders in respect of damages for future pecuniary loss in personal injury cases.",
            "Subject to the above question, the Sub-committee invites submissions on some key issues including:",
            "(i) Whether the court should be given, by way of legislation, the power to make PPOs in respect of damages for future pecuniary loss in personal injury cases?",
            "(ii) What mechanism should be adopted for the formulation and promulgation of the discount rate?",
            "(iii) What factors and limitations, if any, should be imposed on the court's power to award and review PPOs?",
            "(iv) What are the circumstances for reviewing PPOs and related contingencies, and whether the current regime of awarding damages should co-exist with a PPO regime?",
            "(v) Whether the court should take into account the security, funding options and suitability of a paying party before making a PPO?",
            "All views should be submitted on or before August 24, 2018 to: The Secretary, Periodical Payments for Future Pecuniary Loss in Personal Injury Cases Sub-committee, LRC (4/F, Justice Place, East Wing, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central, Hong Kong) by mail, by fax (3918 4096) or by e-mail (",

            "下稿代法律改革委員會發出：法律改革委員會（法改會）轄下的一個小組委員會今日（四月二十五日）發表諮詢文件，就法庭應否獲立法賦予權力，在人身傷害個案中，就原告人未來金錢損失的損害賠償作出按期付款令等事項，諮詢公眾意見。",
            "人身傷害個案按期支付未來金錢損失賠款小組委員會主席梁偉文資深大律師於記者會上表示，諮詢文件旨在找出現行法律與常規做法在評估損害賠償方面有何問題，特別是在人身傷害個案中評估原告人的未來金錢損失方面。",
            "他說：「目的是以便考慮是否需要改革，以容許法庭判給以按期形式支付補償未來金錢損失的賠款，而如需要改革，小組委員會會提出適當的改革建議。」",
            "他表示，小組委員會曾研究其他司法管轄區（例如英國、愛爾蘭、其他歐洲國家、美國和新加坡）的經驗，當考慮香港引入相關法例是否適宜和可行時，這些經驗可作參考。",
            "小組委員會希望提出一些關注事項，邀請公眾就若干開放式問題提交看法，以蒐集公眾和持份者的意見。",
            "諮詢文件中，小組委員會邀請公眾考慮是否需要設立機制，在適當期間訂定折扣率；應賦權誰人或哪個主管當局負責訂定折扣率，並就終審法院首席法官或任何其他人士或機構應否獲賦權訂定和定期修訂此折扣率等事宜，諮詢公眾意見。",
            "在香港現行的法律下，法庭會在審訊時判給整筆款項，以補償原告人持續入息的損失（該項持續入息是指假設原告人沒有蒙受傷害而原本在未來會賺得的款項），以及彌補原告人因受傷害而於未來持續招致的連串必要支出。",
            "法庭所評估的損害賠償必須是一次過整筆支付的，但符合條件而可獲判給暫定損害賠償的個案則屬例外。至於未來金錢損失的損害賠償，法庭可按照與過去金錢損失的損害賠償相同的基準，即回復原狀（restitutio in integrum）或十足補償損失基準予以判給。",
            "梁偉文說：「對法庭而言，這項工作相當困難，原因是評估未來金錢損失的損害賠償時，法庭必須考慮多項因素，包括原告人如非因受到傷害原本或可賺取的收入、原告人在受到傷害後的賺取收入能力，以及在受到傷害後所招致的任何額外開支。損害賠償的評估亦必須以整筆款項方式執行，日後不會再作檢討。」",
            "他表示，這傳統方式帶來不可避免的問題，即就未來金錢損失判給的整筆款項不是太少便是太多，並且一直被普遍批評為不精確及不科學。",
            "另一項與按期付款有關的重要問題，是應否設立機制，以訂定和檢討人身傷害個案中為評估損害賠償而採用的推定投資回報率，並需考慮這機制是否可行及適切。判給的整筆款項只會就原告人未來所出現的入息和支出而作扣減。折扣的計算，是以能合理地預期該筆損害賠償款項如用於投資可得的推定回報率為準，而投資的方式須使原告人能夠在整段期間彌補其損失的總額。",
            "此外，小組委員會也研究是否適宜設立機制，容許收取按期付款的受償人的受養人，在受償人提早死亡（即在其估計工作壽命剩餘期間死亡，而其估計工作壽命因被告人有責任造成的傷害而已遭縮短）的情況下，以「失去生活依靠」為由而提出申索。",
            "總括來說，諮詢文件列出的主要問題是，儘管有需要進一步探討在各方面運作上的可行性，但作為原則而言，法庭應否獲立法賦予權力，在人身傷害個案中就未來金錢損失的損害賠償作出按期付款令。",
            "在這問題的前提下，小組委員會邀請公眾就以下的重要問題提交意見書：",
            "（一）法庭應否獲立法賦予權力，在人身傷害個案中就未來金錢損失的損害賠償作出按期付款令？",
            "（二）折扣率的訂定和發布應採用甚麼機制？",
            "（三）對於法庭判給和檢討按期付款令的權力，應施加甚麼考慮因素和限制（如有的話）？",
            "（四）出現甚麼情況便可檢討按期付款令及相關或有事件，而現行判給損害賠償的體制應否與按期付款令的體制並存？",
            "（五）法庭在作出按期付款令之前，應否考慮付款方的穩健程度、提供資金選項和合適性？",
            "所有意見請於二○一八年八月二十四日或之前以郵遞（香港中環下亞厘畢道18號律政中心東座4樓）、傳真（3918 4096）或電郵（",
