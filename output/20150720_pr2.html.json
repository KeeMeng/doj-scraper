            "Following is the translation of the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, on the implementation of recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission at the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services of the Legislative Council today (July 20):",
            "Madam Chair, members of this Panel,",
            "This is the third time I report to this Panel on the implementation of recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) pursuant to the mechanism introduced by this Panel in 2012.",
            "As the Secretary for Justice and as the Chairman of the LRC, I place great importance in keeping Hong Kong's systems of laws up-to-date. On the other hand, this Panel, together with other relevant Panels of the Legislative Council (LegCo), also has a role to play in facilitating the work of law reform.",
            "In this dual capacity, not only do I, together with the Chief Justice and other members of the LRC, place emphasis on choosing appropriate topics for consideration by the LRC, I continue with my efforts to impress upon the relevant Government policy bureaux or departments the importance of responding to and following up on the LRC reports.",
            "Madam Chair, you and members of this Panel should have before you an information paper for this meeting, setting out by way of a table, information on each of the LRC's reports since 1982, when the first report was published, including details of implementation. The LRC has over the years published a total of 64 reports, making law reform recommendations on different aspects of both substantive and procedural laws, civil and criminal alike.",
            "With the exception of one report recommending no change to the law (Note 1), the remaining 63 reports can be tabulated under the following five categories in accordance with their implementation status:",
            "(a) proposals implemented in full (34 reports, i.e. 54 per cent of the 63 reports);",
            "(b) proposals implemented in part (seven reports, i.e. 11 per cent of the 63 reports) ;",
            "(c) proposals under consideration or in the process of being implemented (17 reports, i.e 27 per cent of the 63 reports);",
            "(d) proposals rejected outright by the Government (three reports, i.e. 4.8 per cent of the 63 reports); and",
            "(e) the Government has no intention to implement these proposals at this juncture (two reports, i.e. 3.2 per cent of the 63 reports).",
            "I appreciate that there remain various reports not implemented, whether by way of legislation or administrative measures. I can report that, except for those 41 reports which have been fully or partially implemented; one report recommended no reform; three were rejected outright; and for two reports, the Government indicated no intention to implement at this juncture. All the remaining 17 reports are being reviewed by the relevant bureaux/departments with constructive feedback to be provided in due course. In brief, progress on implementation of LRC's recommendations has been made, including the introduction of legislative proposals within the next two to three years. Indeed, draft bills have been, or will be, produced in respect of a number of reports, including the Report on Child Custody and Access published in 2005, the Report on Criteria for Service as Jurors published in June 2010 and the Report on Enduring Powers of Attorney: Personal Care published in July 2011.",
            "The LRC attaches great importance to effective implementation of its reports. First, since last year, progress on implementation is now a standing item for discussion at each meeting of the LRC. Second, the LRC keeps in regular contact with the relevant Government bureaux/departments so as to obtain updates on progress of implementation. In this regard, I am most grateful to colleagues in the bureaux/departments concerned for filing the updated progress regularly. Third, to provide easy reference for the public, the progress of implementation is also regularly uploaded onto the LRC's website. Together with members of the LRC, I will continue to monitor progress, in collaboration with this Panel and other Panels of LegCo.",
            "Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（七月二十日）出席立法會司法及法律事務委員會會議時，就法律改革委員會的建議的落實情況發言全文：",
            "主席、各位委員：",
            "今次是我第三次根據本事務委員會於二○一二年建議訂立的機制，向本事務委員會匯報法律改革委員會（法改會）的建議的落實情況。",
            "作為律政司司長和法改會主席，我當然非常重視保持香港的法律制度與時並進，亦深信本事務委員會及立法會其他各個事務委員會可同時發揮作用，共同推動法律改革工作。",
            "我本人、終審法院首席法官及法改會其他成員，不但重視挑選合適的課題供法改會考慮，同時亦持續向政府相關決策局或部門強調回應和跟進法改會的報告書的重要性。",
            "主席和各位委員應已收到一份供今次會議討論的資料文件。這份文件以列表形式，列出法改會自一九八二年發表第一份報告書以來的每份報告書資料及其落實詳情。法改會在過去合共發表了六十四份報告書，就民事和刑事不同方面的實體法和程序法提出改革建議。",
            "在這六十四份報告書中，有一份建議對法律不作改變（註一），而其餘六十三份的落實情況可以分為以下五個類別：",
            "（一）建議已全面落實（三十四份報告書，即六十三份報告書的百分之五十四）；",
            "（二）建議已部分落實（七份報告書，即六十三份報告書的百分之十一）；",
            "（三）建議正在考慮或落實中（十七份報告書，即六十三份報告書的百分之二十七）；",
            "（四）政府當局不接納建議（三份報告書，即六十三份報告書的百分之四點八）；及",
            "（五）政府當局無意在現階段落實建議（兩份報告書，即六十三份報告書的百分之三點二）。",
            "至今確實仍有部分報告書並未以立法或行政措施的方式落實。但我可以向各位報告，除了那些已全面或部分落實的四十一份報告書、一份建議不作改革的報告書、三份政府當局表明不接納的報告書，以及兩份政府當局已表示無意在現階段落實的報告書，政府有關部門現正檢視其餘合共十七份報告書，日後會作出回應。簡言之，落實法改會建議的工作有一定的進展，包括會在未來兩至三年內以立法形式落實該等建議。事實上，政府當局已就或正就多份報告書擬定條例草案，當中包括二○○五年發表的《子女管養權及探視權》報告書、二○一○年六月發表的《出任陪審員的準則》報告書及二○一一年七月發表的《持久授權書：個人照顧事宜》報告書。",
            "法改會十分重視報告書的建議能否有效地落實。首先，自去年開始，法改會每次開會，落實進度必定是討論事項之一。第二，法改會一直與各相關決策局及部門保持溝通，希望他們定期向法改會提交最新的落實進度報告。我對其他決策局及部門的同事在這方面的合作表示感謝。第三，為方便公眾了解落實進度，這些報告亦已上載到法改會的網站。我會繼續與法改會的成員及本事務委員會和立法會其他各個事務委員會合作，一同監察落實進度。",
