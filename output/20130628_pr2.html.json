            "Following is the full text of the speech delivered by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the opening ceremony of the Asia Pacific Regional Arbitration Group Conference 2013 held in Beijing this morning (June 28) (the initial part of the speech was delivered in Putonghua, which is an expression of gratitude for having the chance to address the audience.):",
            "尊敬的最高人民法院周強院長、萬季飛會長、董松根副會長、于建龍主席、馬來西亞吉隆坡區域仲裁中心主席Rajoo先生、聯合國國際貿易法委員會秘書長Sorieul先生、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：",
            "大家好！很高興今天有機會出席「亞太區域仲裁組織大會」2013年會議的開幕式，與來自世界各地的仲裁專家交流經驗。",
            "就這次大會的主題「亞太國際仲裁未來十年──機遇與挑戰」發言之前，我衷心感謝「貿仲委」對香港的支持。去年九月，「貿仲委」在香港設立仲裁中心，這決定代表「貿仲委」對香港作為亞太區仲裁中心投下重要的信心一票。",
            "此外，我希望特別感謝「貿仲委」董會長這次的邀請與協助。我有機會跟大家見面，完全是「貿仲委」和「貿仲委」香港仲裁中心朋友們的功勞。",
            "由於很多在座的朋友是外國朋友，容許我現在轉用英語就這次大會的主題跟大家分享我的意見。",
            "Ladies and gentlemen,",
            "It is my great pleasure and honour to have this opportunity to address so many arbitration experts from all over the world at this welcome and opening session of the Conference.",
            "The theme of this year's Conference is the exploration of the opportunities and challenges of international arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region in the next decade. I would like to take this opportunity to (1) share with you some of my thoughts on the future development of arbitration in the region, and (2) outline what Hong Kong, as an international centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, has been doing so as to provide high-quality dispute resolution services.",
            "(i) Certain thoughts on the development of arbitration",
            "Mapping out the future development of arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region is no easy task. With so many leading experts gathering here, I am sure there would be fruitful exchanges on what will happen and what should be done. May I just highlight some of my views in this aspect.",
            "To begin with, I am confident that the development of arbitration, and indeed other forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), in the Asia-Pacific region is heading towards a golden age.",
            "As pointed out in various economic reports, the Asia-Pacific region has since become the top destination for investors, with China occupying the top rank and India coming next. This year, Asia is leading the global economic recovery. It is obvious that the global economic balance has shifted from the West to the East with the Greater China region being the key growth engine in the Asia-Pacific region. What does this mean? The answer is obvious: the more economic and trade activities, the higher the need for arbitration and ADR services.",
            "Another relevant factor is the fact that globalisation and regional integration will continue, which means that there will be more cross-border or international trade disputes. Whilst litigation will remain as a traditional form of dispute resolution, international arbitration and other forms of ADR will certainly become more and more popular as they can offer advantages that traditional litigation cannot.",
            "The growing interest in investment arbitration is but one example that illustrates this point. The World Bank released a report in May projecting a threefold increase over the current level in the investment flows into the developing countries and regions in the next 20 years. By 2030, China will be the largest investor in the world, accounting for 30 per cent of the global gross investment while India will have a share of 7 per cent.",
            "With a significant boom in cross-border or international investment activities, private-to-government (P2G) investment disputes, along with private-to-private (P2P) commercial disputes, are expected to increase in the Asia-Pacific region. To provide protection for cross-border investment activities, investment promotion and protection agreements emerged in the mid-20th century. In recent years, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round repeatedly ending in deadlock, many WTO members have actively entered into bilateral and plurilateral free trade agreements, economic partnership agreements as well as regional trade agreements, many of which contain provisions on investment protection.",
            "Investment protection agreements and related provisions generally allow foreign investors to submit investment disputes with a host country to arbitration. As shown by the statistics released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in May, the number of cases filed under the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism reached a record high of 58 last year, reflecting that foreign investors are increasingly resorting to the mechanism for resolving their disputes with the government of a host country.",
            "Chinese companies as investors have also started making use of the P2G investment arbitration mechanism. For instance, China Heilongjiang International Economic & Technical Cooperative Corp and other parties submitted a request for arbitration in 2010 to the Permanent Court of Arbitration under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) framework pursuant to the China-Mongolia bilateral investment agreement. In addition, Ping An Life Insurance Company of China, Ltd. and another party filed a request for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) last September. Ping An was seeking compensation for its economic losses caused by the nationalisation of Fortis Bank by the Belgian Government amid the financial crisis in 2008. At a time when multinational enterprises regard China as a preferred investment destination and China's own enterprises are striving to \"go global\", it is foreseeable that investment disputes in the Asia-Pacific region, including the Greater China region, will keep growing.",
            "With the onset of a golden age of arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region, the next natural question is what steps should be taken to prepare ourselves. Amongst others, I think there are at least three areas that merit our attention.",
            "First, there is a need to build up an arbitration culture and an arbitration-friendly environment within the region. This requires efforts not only from the arbitration community, but other relevant stakeholders including the government, the business community, the legal profession as well as the judiciary.",
            "Second, steps should be taken to facilitate the sustainable development of arbitration within the region. Issues such as the quality of arbitrators, appropriate monitoring of arbitration costs and efficiency of the arbitration process are some of the aspects that deserve consideration. Further, research, including multi-disciplinary research, on how best arbitration can develop in the Asia-Pacific region, taking into account its cultural differences from the West, should be conducted on a continuous basis.",
            "Third, the relationship between arbitration and other modes of ADR is another aspect that warrants studies. Different modes of ADR offer different advantages. The end users should be allowed more choices when they have a need to resolve disputes. Arbitration need not be a stand-alone option. Instead, in appropriate cases, arbitration can be combined with other forms of ADR so as to create maximum flexibility and benefits. The combination of arbitration with mediation is but one such example.",
            "(ii) Hong Kong as an international centre for legal services and dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region",
            "As the Secretary for Justice, it is one of my roles to market Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services. So, permit me to move on to outline our recent development. As an international centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong has made continuous efforts to enhance its arbitration and mediation regimes.",
            "Reform of arbitration law in Hong Kong",
            "First of all, we have been working continuously to enhance our arbitration law. The existing Arbitration Ordinance unifies our previous domestic and international arbitration regimes on the basis of the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of UNCITRAL. By adopting a generally familiar international arbitration regime, we provide a good reason for parties to choose Hong Kong as the venue to conduct arbitration.",
            "We also keep a close eye on developments in the arbitration sector. Earlier on, we introduced a Bill to amend the Arbitration Ordinance, so that any emergency relief granted by an emergency arbitrator is enforceable under the Arbitration Ordinance. We expect that the Bill will be passed by the Legislative Council by mid-July.",
            "Worldwide recognition and enforcement of Hong Kong arbitral awards",
            "General recognition and enforceability of arbitral awards in other jurisdictions are the major considerations when parties decide where to arbitrate. Over the years, Hong Kong arbitral awards are already recognised and enforceable in over 140 jurisdictions under the New York Convention.",
            "We continue to seek to enlarge the enforcement network for arbitral awards with other jurisdictions. In March last year, the Indian Government helpfully declared that the People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong) is a reciprocating partner for the purposes of enforcement of arbitral awards under the New York Convention, thereby affirming the enforceability of Hong Kong arbitral awards in India.",
            "As colleagues in the international arbitration community would agree, there has been a marked increase in major international arbitration cases involving Chinese enterprises. As early as 1999, Hong Kong and the Mainland concluded an Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards, effective since February 1, 2000. The enforceability of Hong Kong arbitral awards in the Mainland gives users of Hong Kong arbitration services certainty in this regard.",
            "In January this year, Hong Kong concluded an Arrangement Concerning Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards with Macao. Upon commencement of the Bill I mentioned just now, Hong Kong courts may enforce Macao arbitral awards under the Arrangement.",
            "As we understand, Hong Kong and Taiwan arbitral awards should be reciprocally enforceable under the current legal frameworks of the two places. Taken together, Hong Kong's arbitral awards are enforceable all over the Greater China region. Considering the expectation of arbitration service users for a clear-cut arrangement to facilitate the enforcement of arbitral awards of the two places, the Hong Kong Government is pressing ahead with a proposal to establish a clearer and simpler arrangement with Taiwan on the reciprocal enforcement of arbitral awards.",
            "Presence of branch offices of world-class arbitration institutions",
            "Another edge of Hong Kong is the presence of branch offices of world-class arbitration institutions. Locally, the home-grown Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, which has been established since the 1980s, serves as an independent dispute resolution body.",
            "In 2008, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce opened in Hong Kong its first ever branch of the Secretariat outside the Paris headquarters. Last September, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission established a branch office in Hong Kong, also its very first arbitration centre outside the Mainland. The presence of branch offices of these reputable international arbitration institutions in Hong Kong, coupled with our existing arbitration institutions, places Hong Kong in an even stronger position to meet the demand for high-end dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "Looking ahead, we will pursue vigorously our efforts to attract more reputable international legal, arbitration and mediation institutions to set up offices in Hong Kong so as to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international centre for legal services and dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region. Not long ago, the Hong Kong Government announced its decision to allocate part of the space in the former Central Government Offices for NGOs related to law, arbitration and mediation to set up their offices. This serves to help them to develop relevant services in Hong Kong, which will in turn enhance our competitiveness in the international arena.",
            "Investment arbitration",
            "Earlier on, I made reference to investment arbitration. With a mature common law legal system, internationally renowned arbitration institutions, well-developed arbitration facilities and talents with global visions and a solid grasp of international rules, Hong Kong is well placed to handle all kinds of arbitration, including P2P and P2G ones. Hong Kong's convenient location in the Asia-Pacific region and its close proximity to the Mainland also mean that Hong Kong enjoys a distinct advantage in the provision of quality dispute resolution services involving civil and commercial disputes in the Asia-Pacific including the Greater China region.",
            "Mediation",
            "Apart from arbitration, Hong Kong is committed to the promotion and development of mediation. Our new Mediation Ordinance, which came into operation on January 1 this year, provides a legal framework with emphasis on the protection of confidentiality of mediation communications. In August last year, the Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association was incorporated. This industry-led body aims at providing an effective accreditation system which will ensure the quality of mediators. This in turn will strengthen the mediation services available in Hong Kong and enhance our position as a dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "(iii) Conclusion",
            "The incumbent Chief Executive of Hong Kong has reaffirmed in his Policy Address published early this year that it is an important policy of the Hong Kong Government to enhance our position as an international centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region. As an international financial and commercial centre in the Asia-Pacific region, we have been playing an active role in the economic development of the region. We believe that Hong Kong can leverage its advantages to provide high-end and excellent dispute resolution services to address the growing civil and commercial disputes in the region.",
            "On this note, may I reiterate my gratitude for giving me this valuable opportunity to address you and wish this Conference every success.",
            "Thank you.",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月二十八日）於北京出席「2013亞太區域仲裁組織大會」開幕式的開場發言及致辭全文的中文譯本︰",
            "尊敬的最高人民法院周強院長、萬季飛會長、董松根副會長、于建龍主席、馬來西亞吉隆坡區域仲裁中心主席Rajoo先生、聯合國國際貿易法委員會秘書長Sorieul先生、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：",
            "大家好！很高興今天有機會出席「亞太區域仲裁組織大會」2013年會議的開幕式，與來自世界各地的仲裁專家交流經驗。",
            "就這次大會的主題「亞太國際仲裁未來十年──機遇與挑戰」發言之前，我衷心感謝「貿仲委」對香港的支持。去年九月，「貿仲委」在香港設立仲裁中心，這決定代表「貿仲委」對香港作為亞太區仲裁中心投下重要的信心一票。",
            "此外，我希望特別感謝「貿仲委」董會長這次的邀請與協助。我有機會跟大家見面，完全是「貿仲委」和「貿仲委」香港仲裁中心朋友們的功勞。",
            "由於很多在座的朋友是外國朋友，容許我現在轉用英語就這次大會的主題跟大家分享我的意見。",
            "（以下為致辭全文的中文譯本）",
            "女士們、先生們：",
            "我非常高興和榮幸，有機會在這大會的開幕式向眾多來自世界各地的仲裁專家致辭。",
            "今年大會的主題，是探討未來十年亞太地區國際仲裁面臨的機遇和挑戰。我會借此機會：（1）與大家分享我對仲裁在區內未來發展的若干看法；（2）向大家簡介香港作為亞太區法律及仲裁服務中心，為提供高質素的解決爭議服務所做的工作。",
            "窺探仲裁在亞太區的未來發展殊不容易。在座有這麼多的仲裁專家，我相信大家一定能就未來的發展和應做的工作進行有成效的交流。容許我在這方面只重點簡述幾項意見。",
            "首先，我有信心亞太區的仲裁及其他另類模式的解決爭議方式（ADR）將進入一個黃金時代。",
            "正如不同的經濟報告指出，亞太地區是近年投資者首選的目的地，中國在這方面排名榜首，而印度則佔第二位。今年亞洲在全球的經濟復蘇中處於領跑位置。全球的經濟重心明顯由西方轉移至東方，而大中華地區是亞太區主要增長引擎。這意味甚麼？答案明顯不過：越是多經濟和貿易活動，對仲裁和其他ADR的需求也會越多。",
            "另一相關因素是全球化和地域融合的趨勢將持續，因此不難推論將會有更多的跨境或國際商貿糾紛。雖然訴訟仍會是傳統的解決爭議方式，但國際仲裁及其他形式的ADR必定越來越普及，因為它們享有傳統訴訟缺乏的優勢。",
            "投資仲裁的崛起便是引證以上觀點的一個例子。世界銀行五月份的報告指出，未來二十年全球流向發展中國家和地區的投資額將比現有水平增長三倍，到二○三○年中國將成為全球最大的投資者，佔全球投資總額百分之三十，而印度則佔百分之七。",
            "除了私人企業（P2P）之間的商事糾紛外，預期在亞太區內投資者與政府之間（P2G）的投資爭議亦將會隨跨境投資活動頻繁而增加。為保護跨境投資活動，投資促進和保護協定在二十世紀中興起。近年受世界貿易組織多哈回合談判一再停滯的影響，不少世貿成員積極簽訂雙邊及多邊自由貿易協定、經濟夥伴關係協定和區域貿易協定等安排，這些協定有不少是包含投資保護條款。",
            "投資保護協定及相關條款一般也容許境外投資者將與東道國之間產生的投資爭議交付仲裁。聯合國貿易和發展會議五月份發表的數據顯示，去年在投資者與國家爭議解決機制下提交的案例數目創歷史新高的５８個，顯示越來越多投資者開始使用這機制來解決與東道國政府之間的爭議。",
            "內地公司作為投資方，亦開始使用P2G投資仲裁機制。例如在二○一○年，中國黑龍江國際經濟技術合作公司等依據中國與蒙古的雙邊投資協定，在UNCITRAL框架下向常設仲裁法院提出仲裁請求。此外，中國平安人壽保險股份有限公司等在去年九月，向ICSID提交仲裁請求書，要求比利時政府在二○○八年金融危機期間對富通銀行進行國有化因而對平保造成的經濟損失作仲裁。在全球跨國企業將中國視為投資的首要目標，而中國企業亦積極「走出去」的同時，可以預期亞太區（包括大中華地區）的投資爭議會持續上升。",
            "接下來的問題是我們應如何裝備自己，以迎接亞太區仲裁黃金時期的來臨。除其他議題外，我認為至少有三方面值得我們留意。",
            "首先，我們需要在區內營造仲裁文化和有利仲裁的環境。這方面不單需要仲裁界的努力，也要包括政府、商界、法律界及司法界等相關持份者的協助。",
            "第二，我們應採取措施，致力令仲裁服務能有可持續發展。諸如仲裁員的素質、仲裁費用的適度調控及仲裁程序的效率等議題均值得考慮。此外，研究工作，包括跨界別的研究工作，從而探討在亞洲與西方文化差異下如何完善仲裁在亞太區的發展，也應持續地進行。",
            "第三，仲裁與其他ADR模式之間的關係也值得研究。不同模式的ADR享有不同的優勢。當面對糾紛時，用家應有多方面的選擇。仲裁不一定要以獨立、個別的模式進行。反之，在適當情況下，仲裁與其他ADR模式合併後能產生最大靈活性和優勢。仲裁與調解的結合便是當中一個好例子。",
            "作為香港律政司司長，我其中一個職責是推廣香港的法律及解決爭議服務。因此，容許我用一點時間向大家簡介香港在這方面的近況。香港作為亞太區的國際法律及解決爭議服務中心，不斷完善相關制度。",
            "首先，我們不斷完善香港的仲裁法例，以吸引更多當事人以香港為首選的仲裁地。現行的《仲裁條例》，統一香港過往的本地及國際仲裁制度，以聯合國國際貿易法委員會的《國際商事仲裁示範法》為基礎，採用一套廣為熟悉的國際仲裁制度，便利商界和仲裁人員使用，從而吸引他們選擇在香港進行仲裁。",
            "我們亦密切留意仲裁界的發展。香港於早前提交《仲裁條例》的修訂草案，從而令緊急仲裁員所批准的緊急濟助，可按照《仲裁條例》強制執行。我們期望該草案在下月中旬能獲立法會通過。",
            "一般而言，決定仲裁地的主要因素，包括該地方的仲裁裁決能否廣泛地在其他司法管轄區獲得相互承認和執行。在香港所作出的仲裁裁決，至今已可根據《紐約公約》與超過140個司法管轄區相互承認和執行。",
            "我們仍然不斷致力與其他司法管轄區拓展強制執行仲裁裁決的網絡。印度政府於去年三月宣布，確認中華人民共和國（包括香港）是《紐約公約》下強制執行仲裁裁決的相互執行夥伴，確認香港仲裁裁決可在印度強制執行。",
            "相信國際仲裁同業均會同意，在大型國際仲裁案件中，涉及中國企業的案件明顯上升。早在一九九九年，香港與內地簽署《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的安排》，並在二○○○年二月一日生效。鑑於在香港作出的仲裁裁決可在內地執行，為採用香港仲裁服務的當事人提供在內地執行仲裁裁決的肯定性。",
            "今年一月，香港與澳門亦簽訂相互認可和執行仲裁裁決的安排。我剛才提及的條例草案生效以後，香港法院可按該安排強制執行在澳門作出的仲裁裁決。",
            "據我們理解，根據香港和台灣雙方現時各自的法律框架，應可執行對方的仲裁裁決，故此香港的仲裁裁決現應可以在大中華地區強制執行。但由於考慮到仲裁服務的使用者期望能有一明確的安排以便執行兩地的仲裁裁決，香港政府積極建議與台灣訂立一個更清晰和簡便的相互執行仲裁裁決的安排。",
            "香港的另一項優勢，是設有世界級仲裁機構的辦事處。本地自一九八○年代已創立的「香港國際仲裁中心」，為獨立的爭議解決機構。",
            "二○○八年，「國際商會國際仲裁院」在香港設立其亞洲秘書處分處，成為該院首個在其巴黎總部以外設立的秘書處分處。去年九月，「中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會」在香港設立仲裁中心，成為貿仲委在內地以外的首個仲裁中心。隨這些國際知名的仲裁機構在香港設立辦事處，加上香港既有的仲裁機構，香港擁有更完備的條件去滿足亞太區內對高端解決爭議服務的需求。",
            "未來我們會繼續積極吸引享負盛名的國際法律、仲裁和調解機構在香港設立辦事處，從而鞏固香港作為亞太區的國際法律及解決爭議服務中心。香港政府早前宣布，在前中區政府總部預留部分地方，供法律、仲裁和調解相關的非政府機構設立辦事處，以協助這些機構在香港發展有關服務，從而強化香港在這方面的國際競爭力。",
            "我早前曾提及投資仲裁。香港有成熟的普通法法律制度，設有國際知名的仲裁機構，擁有完善的仲裁設施、具有國際視野、掌握國際規則的人才，有能力處理P2P及P2G等不同種類的仲裁。加上香港位處亞太區，並鄰近內地，這一切都令香港享有獨特優勢，就區內（包括大中華區）的民商事糾紛，提供高素質的解決爭議服務。",
            "除仲裁外，香港亦致力提倡和發展調解服務。新的《調解條例》已於二○一三年一月一日起實施，《條例》訂定了一套法律框架，當中特別重保障調解通訊的保密性。去年八月，「香港調解資歷評審協會」成立，該協會由業界主導，旨在確立一個有效的資格評審制度，確保調解員的質素，從而鞏固香港的調解服務，強化香港作為亞太區解決爭議中心的地位。",
            "現任香港行政長官在今年初發表的《施政報告》中重申，強化香港作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心的地位是香港政府的重要政策。作為亞太區的國際金融中心，我們積極參與區內的經濟發展。與此同時，我們相信，香港同樣能發揮優勢，就區內不斷增加的民商事糾紛，提供高端和卓越的爭議解決服務。",
            "最後，我再次多謝大會給予我發言機會，並祝願大會取得美滿的成果。",
            "謝謝。",

            "As shown by the statistics released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in May, the number of cases filed under the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism reached a record high of 58 last year, reflecting that foreign investors are increasingly resorting to the mechanism for resolving their disputes with the government of a host country.",
            "Chinese companies as investors have also started making use of the P2G investment arbitration mechanism",
            "For instance, China Heilongjiang International Economic & Technical Cooperative Corp and other parties submitted a request for arbitration in 2010 to the Permanent Court of Arbitration under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) framework pursuant to the China-Mongolia bilateral investment agreement",
            "In addition, Ping An Life Insurance Company of China, Ltd",
            "and another party filed a request for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) last September",
            "Ping An was seeking compensation for its economic losses caused by the nationalisation of Fortis Bank by the Belgian Government amid the financial crisis in 2008",
            "At a time when multinational enterprises regard China as a preferred investment destination and China's own enterprises are striving to \"go global\", it is foreseeable that investment disputes in the Asia-Pacific region, including the Greater China region, will keep growing.",
            "With the onset of a golden age of arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region, the next natural question is what steps should be taken to prepare ourselves",
            "Amongst others, I think there are at least three areas that merit our attention.",
            "First, there is a need to build up an arbitration culture and an arbitration-friendly environment within the region",
            "This requires efforts not only from the arbitration community, but other relevant stakeholders including the government, the business community, the legal profession as well as the judiciary.",
            "Second, steps should be taken to facilitate the sustainable development of arbitration within the region",
            "Issues such as the quality of arbitrators, appropriate monitoring of arbitration costs and efficiency of the arbitration process are some of the aspects that deserve consideration",
            "Further, research, including multi-disciplinary research, on how best arbitration can develop in the Asia-Pacific region, taking into account its cultural differences from the West, should be conducted on a continuous basis.",
            "Third, the relationship between arbitration and other modes of ADR is another aspect that warrants studies",
            "Different modes of ADR offer different advantages",
            "The end users should be allowed more choices when they have a need to resolve disputes",
            "Arbitration need not be a stand-alone option",
            "Instead, in appropriate cases, arbitration can be combined with other forms of ADR so as to create maximum flexibility and benefits",
            "The combination of arbitration with mediation is but one such example.",
            "(ii) Hong Kong as an international centre for legal services and dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region",
            "As the Secretary for Justice, it is one of my roles to market Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services",
            "So, permit me to move on to outline our recent development",
            "As an international centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong has made continuous efforts to enhance its arbitration and mediation regimes.",
            "Reform of arbitration law in Hong Kong",
            "First of all, we have been working continuously to enhance our arbitration law",
            "The existing Arbitration Ordinance unifies our previous domestic and international arbitration regimes on the basis of the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of UNCITRAL",
            "By adopting a generally familiar international arbitration regime, we provide a good reason for parties to choose Hong Kong as the venue to conduct arbitration.",
            "We also keep a close eye on developments in the arbitration sector",
            "Earlier on, we introduced a Bill to amend the Arbitration Ordinance, so that any emergency relief granted by an emergency arbitrator is enforceable under the Arbitration Ordinance",
            "We expect that the Bill will be passed by the Legislative Council by mid-July.",
            "Worldwide recognition and enforcement of Hong Kong arbitral awards",
            "General recognition and enforceability of arbitral awards in other jurisdictions are the major considerations when parties decide where to arbitrate",
            "Over the years, Hong Kong arbitral awards are already recognised and enforceable in over 140 jurisdictions under the New York Convention.",
            "We continue to seek to enlarge the enforcement network for arbitral awards with other jurisdictions",
            "In March last year, the Indian Government helpfully declared that the People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong) is a reciprocating partner for the purposes of enforcement of arbitral awards under the New York Convention, thereby affirming the enforceability of Hong Kong arbitral awards in India.",
            "As colleagues in the international arbitration community would agree, there has been a marked increase in major international arbitration cases involving Chinese enterprises",
            "As early as 1999, Hong Kong and the Mainland concluded an Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards, effective since February 1, 2000",
            "The enforceability of Hong Kong arbitral awards in the Mainland gives users of Hong Kong arbitration services certainty in this regard.",
            "In January this year, Hong Kong concluded an Arrangement Concerning Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards with Macao",
            "Upon commencement of the Bill I mentioned just now, Hong Kong courts may enforce Macao arbitral awards under the Arrangement.",
            "As we understand, Hong Kong and Taiwan arbitral awards should be reciprocally enforceable under the current legal frameworks of the two places",
            "Taken together, Hong Kong's arbitral awards are enforceable all over the Greater China region",
            "Considering the expectation of arbitration service users for a clear-cut arrangement to facilitate the enforcement of arbitral awards of the two places, the Hong Kong Government is pressing ahead with a proposal to establish a clearer and simpler arrangement with Taiwan on the reciprocal enforcement of arbitral awards.",
            "Presence of branch offices of world-class arbitration institutions",
            "Another edge of Hong Kong is the presence of branch offices of world-class arbitration institutions",
            "Locally, the home-grown Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, which has been established since the 1980s, serves as an independent dispute resolution body.",
            "In 2008, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce opened in Hong Kong its first ever branch of the Secretariat outside the Paris headquarters",
            "Last September, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission established a branch office in Hong Kong, also its very first arbitration centre outside the Mainland",
            "The presence of branch offices of these reputable international arbitration institutions in Hong Kong, coupled with our existing arbitration institutions, places Hong Kong in an even stronger position to meet the demand for high-end dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "Looking ahead, we will pursue vigorously our efforts to attract more reputable international legal, arbitration and mediation institutions to set up offices in Hong Kong so as to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international centre for legal services and dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region",
            "Not long ago, the Hong Kong Government announced its decision to allocate part of the space in the former Central Government Offices for NGOs related to law, arbitration and mediation to set up their offices",
            "This serves to help them to develop relevant services in Hong Kong, which will in turn enhance our competitiveness in the international arena.",
            "Investment arbitration",
            "Earlier on, I made reference to investment arbitration",
            "With a mature common law legal system, internationally renowned arbitration institutions, well-developed arbitration facilities and talents with global visions and a solid grasp of international rules, Hong Kong is well placed to handle all kinds of arbitration, including P2P and P2G ones",
            "Hong Kong's convenient location in the Asia-Pacific region and its close proximity to the Mainland also mean that Hong Kong enjoys a distinct advantage in the provision of quality dispute resolution services involving civil and commercial disputes in the Asia-Pacific including the Greater China region.",
            "Mediation",
            "Apart from arbitration, Hong Kong is committed to the promotion and development of mediation",
            "Our new Mediation Ordinance, which came into operation on January 1 this year, provides a legal framework with emphasis on the protection of confidentiality of mediation communications",
            "In August last year, the Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association was incorporated",
            "This industry-led body aims at providing an effective accreditation system which will ensure the quality of mediators",
            "This in turn will strengthen the mediation services available in Hong Kong and enhance our position as a dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "(iii) Conclusion",
            "The incumbent Chief Executive of Hong Kong has reaffirmed in his Policy Address published early this year that it is an important policy of the Hong Kong Government to enhance our position as an international centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region",
            "As an international financial and commercial centre in the Asia-Pacific region, we have been playing an active role in the economic development of the region",
            "We believe that Hong Kong can leverage its advantages to provide high-end and excellent dispute resolution services to address the growing civil and commercial disputes in the region.",
            "On this note, may I reiterate my gratitude for giving me this valuable opportunity to address you and wish this Conference every success.",
            "Thank you.",

            "尊敬的最高人民法院周強院長、萬季飛會長、董松根副會長、于建龍主席、馬來西亞吉隆坡區域仲裁中心主席Rajoo先生、聯合國國際貿易法委員會秘書長Sorieul先生、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：",
            "大家好！很高興今天有機會出席「亞太區域仲裁組織大會」2013年會議的開幕式，與來自世界各地的仲裁專家交流經驗",
            "就這次大會的主題「亞太國際仲裁未來十年──機遇與挑戰」發言之前，我衷心感謝「貿仲委」對香港的支持",
            "去年九月，「貿仲委」在香港設立仲裁中心，這決定代表「貿仲委」對香港作為亞太區仲裁中心投下重要的信心一票",
            "此外，我希望特別感謝「貿仲委」董會長這次的邀請與協助",
            "我有機會跟大家見面，完全是「貿仲委」和「貿仲委」香港仲裁中心朋友們的功勞",
            "由於很多在座的朋友是外國朋友，容許我現在轉用英語就這次大會的主題跟大家分享我的意見",
            "（以下為致辭全文的中文譯本）",
            "女士們、先生們：",
            "我非常高興和榮幸，有機會在這大會的開幕式向眾多來自世界各地的仲裁專家致辭",
            "今年大會的主題，是探討未來十年亞太地區國際仲裁面臨的機遇和挑戰",
            "我會借此機會：（1）與大家分享我對仲裁在區內未來發展的若干看法；（2）向大家簡介香港作為亞太區法律及仲裁服務中心，為提供高質素的解決爭議服務所做的工作",
            "窺探仲裁在亞太區的未來發展殊不容易",
            "在座有這麼多的仲裁專家，我相信大家一定能就未來的發展和應做的工作進行有成效的交流",
            "容許我在這方面只重點簡述幾項意見",
            "首先，我有信心亞太區的仲裁及其他另類模式的解決爭議方式（ADR）將進入一個黃金時代",
            "正如不同的經濟報告指出，亞太地區是近年投資者首選的目的地，中國在這方面排名榜首，而印度則佔第二位",
            "今年亞洲在全球的經濟復蘇中處於領跑位置",
            "全球的經濟重心明顯由西方轉移至東方，而大中華地區是亞太區主要增長引擎",
            "這意味甚麼？答案明顯不過：越是多經濟和貿易活動，對仲裁和其他ADR的需求也會越多",
            "另一相關因素是全球化和地域融合的趨勢將持續，因此不難推論將會有更多的跨境或國際商貿糾紛",
            "雖然訴訟仍會是傳統的解決爭議方式，但國際仲裁及其他形式的ADR必定越來越普及，因為它們享有傳統訴訟缺乏的優勢",
            "投資仲裁的崛起便是引證以上觀點的一個例子",
            "世界銀行五月份的報告指出，未來二十年全球流向發展中國家和地區的投資額將比現有水平增長三倍，到二○三○年中國將成為全球最大的投資者，佔全球投資總額百分之三十，而印度則佔百分之七",
            "為保護跨境投資活動，投資促進和保護協定在二十世紀中興起",
            "近年受世界貿易組織多哈回合談判一再停滯的影響，不少世貿成員積極簽訂雙邊及多邊自由貿易協定、經濟夥伴關係協定和區域貿易協定等安排，這些協定有不少是包含投資保護條款",
            "投資保護協定及相關條款一般也容許境外投資者將與東道國之間產生的投資爭議交付仲裁",
            "聯合國貿易和發展會議五月份發表的數據顯示，去年在投資者與國家爭議解決機制下提交的案例數目創歷史新高的５８個，顯示越來越多投資者開始使用這機制來解決與東道國政府之間的爭議",
            "內地公司作為投資方，亦開始使用P2G投資仲裁機制",
            "例如在二○一○年，中國黑龍江國際經濟技術合作公司等依據中國與蒙古的雙邊投資協定，在UNCITRAL框架下向常設仲裁法院提出仲裁請求",
            "此外，中國平安人壽保險股份有限公司等在去年九月，向ICSID提交仲裁請求書，要求比利時政府在二○○八年金融危機期間對富通銀行進行國有化因而對平保造成的經濟損失作仲裁",
            "在全球跨國企業將中國視為投資的首要目標，而中國企業亦積極「走出去」的同時，可以預期亞太區（包括大中華地區）的投資爭議會持續上升",
            "接下來的問題是我們應如何裝備自己，以迎接亞太區仲裁黃金時期的來臨",
            "除其他議題外，我認為至少有三方面值得我們留意",
            "首先，我們需要在區內營造仲裁文化和有利仲裁的環境",
            "這方面不單需要仲裁界的努力，也要包括政府、商界、法律界及司法界等相關持份者的協助",
            "第二，我們應採取措施，致力令仲裁服務能有可持續發展",
            "諸如仲裁員的素質、仲裁費用的適度調控及仲裁程序的效率等議題均值得考慮",
            "此外，研究工作，包括跨界別的研究工作，從而探討在亞洲與西方文化差異下如何完善仲裁在亞太區的發展，也應持續地進行",
            "第三，仲裁與其他ADR模式之間的關係也值得研究",
            "不同模式的ADR享有不同的優勢",
            "當面對糾紛時，用家應有多方面的選擇",
            "仲裁不一定要以獨立、個別的模式進行",
            "反之，在適當情況下，仲裁與其他ADR模式合併後能產生最大靈活性和優勢",
            "仲裁與調解的結合便是當中一個好例子",
            "作為香港律政司司長，我其中一個職責是推廣香港的法律及解決爭議服務",
            "因此，容許我用一點時間向大家簡介香港在這方面的近況",
            "香港作為亞太區的國際法律及解決爭議服務中心，不斷完善相關制度",
            "首先，我們不斷完善香港的仲裁法例，以吸引更多當事人以香港為首選的仲裁地",
            "現行的《仲裁條例》，統一香港過往的本地及國際仲裁制度，以聯合國國際貿易法委員會的《國際商事仲裁示範法》為基礎，採用一套廣為熟悉的國際仲裁制度，便利商界和仲裁人員使用，從而吸引他們選擇在香港進行仲裁",
            "我們亦密切留意仲裁界的發展",
            "香港於早前提交《仲裁條例》的修訂草案，從而令緊急仲裁員所批准的緊急濟助，可按照《仲裁條例》強制執行",
            "我們期望該草案在下月中旬能獲立法會通過",
            "一般而言，決定仲裁地的主要因素，包括該地方的仲裁裁決能否廣泛地在其他司法管轄區獲得相互承認和執行",
            "在香港所作出的仲裁裁決，至今已可根據《紐約公約》與超過140個司法管轄區相互承認和執行",
            "我們仍然不斷致力與其他司法管轄區拓展強制執行仲裁裁決的網絡",
            "印度政府於去年三月宣布，確認中華人民共和國（包括香港）是《紐約公約》下強制執行仲裁裁決的相互執行夥伴，確認香港仲裁裁決可在印度強制執行",
            "相信國際仲裁同業均會同意，在大型國際仲裁案件中，涉及中國企業的案件明顯上升",
            "早在一九九九年，香港與內地簽署《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的安排》，並在二○○○年二月一日生效",
            "鑑於在香港作出的仲裁裁決可在內地執行，為採用香港仲裁服務的當事人提供在內地執行仲裁裁決的肯定性",
            "今年一月，香港與澳門亦簽訂相互認可和執行仲裁裁決的安排",
            "我剛才提及的條例草案生效以後，香港法院可按該安排強制執行在澳門作出的仲裁裁決",
            "據我們理解，根據香港和台灣雙方現時各自的法律框架，應可執行對方的仲裁裁決，故此香港的仲裁裁決現應可以在大中華地區強制執行",
            "但由於考慮到仲裁服務的使用者期望能有一明確的安排以便執行兩地的仲裁裁決，香港政府積極建議與台灣訂立一個更清晰和簡便的相互執行仲裁裁決的安排",
            "香港的另一項優勢，是設有世界級仲裁機構的辦事處",
            "本地自一九八○年代已創立的「香港國際仲裁中心」，為獨立的爭議解決機構",
            "二○○八年，「國際商會國際仲裁院」在香港設立其亞洲秘書處分處，成為該院首個在其巴黎總部以外設立的秘書處分處",
            "去年九月，「中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會」在香港設立仲裁中心，成為貿仲委在內地以外的首個仲裁中心",
            "隨這些國際知名的仲裁機構在香港設立辦事處，加上香港既有的仲裁機構，香港擁有更完備的條件去滿足亞太區內對高端解決爭議服務的需求",
            "未來我們會繼續積極吸引享負盛名的國際法律、仲裁和調解機構在香港設立辦事處，從而鞏固香港作為亞太區的國際法律及解決爭議服務中心",
            "香港政府早前宣布，在前中區政府總部預留部分地方，供法律、仲裁和調解相關的非政府機構設立辦事處，以協助這些機構在香港發展有關服務，從而強化香港在這方面的國際競爭力",
            "我早前曾提及投資仲裁",
            "加上香港位處亞太區，並鄰近內地，這一切都令香港享有獨特優勢，就區內（包括大中華區）的民商事糾紛，提供高素質的解決爭議服務",
            "除仲裁外，香港亦致力提倡和發展調解服務",
            "新的《調解條例》已於二○一三年一月一日起實施，《條例》訂定了一套法律框架，當中特別重保障調解通訊的保密性",
            "去年八月，「香港調解資歷評審協會」成立，該協會由業界主導，旨在確立一個有效的資格評審制度，確保調解員的質素，從而鞏固香港的調解服務，強化香港作為亞太區解決爭議中心的地位",
            "現任香港行政長官在今年初發表的《施政報告》中重申，強化香港作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心的地位是香港政府的重要政策",
            "作為亞太區的國際金融中心，我們積極參與區內的經濟發展",
            "與此同時，我們相信，香港同樣能發揮優勢，就區內不斷增加的民商事糾紛，提供高端和卓越的爭議解決服務",
            "最後，我再次多謝大會給予我發言機會，並祝願大會取得美滿的成果",
            "謝謝",
