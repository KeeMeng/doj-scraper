            "In response to an incident in which a Senior Public Prosecutor was surrounded and verbally abused after a hearing at the High Court last Friday, a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) today (September 30) stressed that such behaviour should not be tolerated. While prosecutors are not immune from criticisms, they should not become victims of such unwarranted abuses. Prosecutors conduct criminal prosecutions not because of their personal interests, they do so on behalf of the public as \"ministers of justice\"; any arbitrary attack on our prosecutorial work would undermine our rule of law.",
            "In respect of prosecutorial decision in every case, the DoJ must make an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and applicable law, focusing on the acts of the offenders, irrespective of any political beliefs or background of the persons involved. There is no political consideration. We have all along been discharging prosecutorial duties fairly and without prejudice or favour. Our prosecutors will continue to uphold the above principle professionally and independently in the pursuit of justice.",

            "對於上周五有一名律政司的高級檢控官在高等法院處理案件後遭包圍及辱罵，律政司發言人今日（九月三十日）表示，有關行為絕對不能容忍。檢控人員固然並非可免受批評，但絕對不應該受到無的放矢的謾罵攻擊。檢控人員肩負刑事檢控工作非為個人利益，而是代公眾擔當「秉行公義者」的角色；任意攻擊我們的檢控工作，會損害香港的法治。",
            "就每宗案件的刑事檢控決定，律政司是按證據和法律進行客觀和專業的分析，檢控人員聚焦的是犯案者的行爲，而不會因涉案人士的政治理念或背景，在處理上有所不同。我們的檢控工作，並沒有任何政治考慮，亦一直是不偏不倚、一視同仁。我們的檢控人員會以秉行公義為目標，繼續以獨立自主的專業態度堅守上述原則。",
