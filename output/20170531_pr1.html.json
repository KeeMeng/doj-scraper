            "The Government will introduce the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 in the Legislative Council (LegCo) to propose a number of miscellaneous amendments to various Ordinances for the purpose of updating and further improving the relevant legislation.",
            "A spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) said today (May 31) that the LegCo Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services has been consulted on the Bill. The Bill will be gazetted on June 2, and will then be introduced to the LegCo on June 14.",
            "The major proposed amendments include:",
            "(1) To amend the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap. 221) and the Live Television Link and Video Recorded Evidence Rules (Cap. 221J)",
            "Currently, under section 79B of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap. 221), the court may, on its own motion or upon application, permit a person falling within any of the following three categories to testify by way of a live television link:",
            "(a) a child (other than a defendant) giving evidence in proceedings in respect of an offence of sexual abuse or cruelty, or of an offence (other than one triable summarily only) which involves an assault on, or injury or a threat of injury to, a person;",
            "(b) a mentally incapacitated person (including a defendant) giving evidence in proceedings in respect of an offence that is triable otherwise than summarily only; or",
            "(c) a \"witness in fear\" giving evidence in proceedings in respect of any offence.",
            "A \"witness in fear\" is defined in section 79B(1) to mean a witness whom the court hearing the evidence is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, is apprehensive as to the safety of himself or any member of his family if he testifies. While it is possible that a complainant of sexual offences can be a \"witness in fear\", and hence be covered by the existing section 79B, it is not necessarily so. A complainant or witness of a sexual offence, though not \"in fear\" as defined in the current legislation, ought nonetheless to be treated with understanding, fairness and dignity.",
            "Accordingly, DoJ proposes to add a new provision to section 79B of Cap. 221, so that where a complainant within the meaning of section 156(8) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) is to give evidence in proceedings in respect of a specified sexual offence within the meaning of section 117(1) of Cap. 200, the court may, on application or on its own motion, permit the complainant to testify by way of a live television link, subject to such conditions as the court may consider appropriate in the circumstances. A consequential amendment will also be made to section 83V(13) of Cap. 221 so that the existing power of the Court of Appeal to examine a witness in accordance with section 79B of Cap. 221 will be extended to cover a complainant of a specified sexual offence. Further, rule 3 of the Live Television Link and Video Recorded Evidence Rules (Cap. 221J), which concerns the procedure of an application made under section 79B, will be amended accordingly to cover such a complainant.",
            "(2) To amend the High Court Ordinance (Cap. 4), the District Court Ordinance (Cap. 336) and the Competition Ordinance (Cap. 619) so as to clarify the jurisdiction and powers of temporary registrars of different ranks during the period for which he is appointed.",
            "(3) To amend the District Court Ordinance (Cap. 336) to provide for representation of the Secretary for Justice in the composition of the District Court Rules Committee so as to make its composition consistent with all of the Rules Committees set up under various Ordinances for the making of court rules.",
            "(4) To amend the English text of the Mainland Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance (Cap. 597) so as to maintain consistency with the English usage of the same term in the Mainland in making references to a specific level of courts in the judicial system there.",
            "(5) To amend the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap. 159), the Admission and Registration Rules (Cap. 159B), the Laws (Loose-leaf Publication) Ordinance 1990 (51 of 1990), the Legislation Publication Ordinance (Cap. 614) and other miscellaneous and technical amendments.",

            "政府將向立法會提交《2017年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》（《條例草案》）建議對多項法例作出雜項修訂，以更新和進一步完善相關法例。",
            "律政司發言人今日（五月三十一日）表示，律政司已就該《條例草案》徵詢立法會司法及法律事務委員會意見，《條例草案》將於六月二日刊憲，並於六月十四日提交立法會審議。",
            "修訂建議的主要內容包括：",
            "（一）修訂《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）及《電視直播聯繫及錄影紀錄證據規則》（第221J章）",
            "現時，根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）第79B條，法庭可主動或應申請准許任何屬以下三類的人士，藉電視直播聯繫方式作證：",
            "（甲）在就性虐待罪行、殘暴罪行或涉及襲擊、傷害或恐嚇傷害某人的罪行（只可循簡易程序審訊者除外）進行的法律程序中提供證據的兒童（被告人除外）；",
            "（乙）在法律程序中提供證據的精神上無行為能力的人，包括被告人（但如法律程序是就只可循簡易程序審訊的罪行而進行，則屬例外）；或",
            "（丙）在就任何罪行進行的法律程序中提供證據的「在恐懼中的證人」。",
            "根據第79B（1）條的定義，法庭基於合理理由，信納某證人如作證，會對其本身或其家庭成員的安全感到憂慮，該證人即屬「在恐懼中的證人」。儘管性罪行申訴人有可能是「在恐懼中的證人」，因而受現行第79B條涵蓋，但此並非必然。即使性罪行申訴人或證人並非現行法例所界定的「在恐懼中」，也應獲得理解、公平對待和尊重。",
            "因此，律政司建議在第221章第79B條中新增一項條文，訂明凡屬《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）第156（8）條所指的申訴人，在就指明性罪行（第200章第117（1）條所指者）進行的法律程序中提供證據，法庭可應申請或主動准許該申訴人透過電視直播聯繫方式提供證據，並可施加法庭認為在有關情況下屬恰當的條件規限。第221章第83V（13）條也作相應修訂，以擴大上訴法庭根據第221章第79B條訊問證人的現有權力至涵蓋指明性罪行的申訴人。《電視直播聯繫及錄影紀錄證據規則》（第221J章）第3條（關乎根據第79B條提出申請的程序）也會作相應修訂，以涵蓋該等申訴人。",
            "（二）修訂《高等法院條例》（第4章）、《區域法院條例》（第336章）、《競爭條例》（第619章），使各職級暫委司法常務官在其委任期間的司法管轄權及權力更為清晰。",
            "（三）修訂《區域法院條例》（第336章），使區域法院規則委員會中有律政司司長的代表，以致其組成與其他根據不同條例設立負責訂立法院規則的各個規則委員會的做法統一。",
            "（四）修訂《內地判決（交互強制執行）條例》（第597章）的英文文本，使在提述內地司法制度下具體法院等級時，使用與內地對應英文名稱一致的表述。",
            "（五）修訂《法律執業者條例》（第159章）、《認許及註冊規則》（第159B章）、《1990年法例（活頁版）條例》（1990年第51號）、《法例發布條例》（第614章）和其他雜項及技術性修訂。",
