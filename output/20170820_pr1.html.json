            "In response to the public procession on the case on sentence review today (August 20), a spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government gave the following response:",
            "Over the past 20 years since the establishment of the HKSAR, the freedom and the right of speech, demonstration, assembly, etc have all along been protected by the Basic Law. The rule of law and judicial independence are the important elements of the success of the \"one country, two systems\" policy and are widely recognised by the international community. Both the HKSAR Government and Hong Kong people respect and safeguard these core values.",
            "Regarding the Court of Appeal case concerning Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow, as clearly pointed out by the Department of Justice (DoJ) earlier, the decisions to prosecute and appeal were made in accordance with the Prosecution Code, applicable laws and relevant evidence. There is absolutely no political consideration involved. Further, allegations that the Court is under political interference are totally unfounded and groundless. We notice that the joint statement of the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong has pointed out the errors in these allegations.",
            "In fact, the Court's acceptance of DoJ's application to review the sentence meant that the application is well founded on legal grounds. In other words, the whole process, from the decision to prosecute, conviction, DoJ's application for sentence review and the judgment of the Court of Appeal, has been proceeded in accordance with Hong Kong's effective legal system.",
            "The HKSAR Government is aware that the community has different views on the judgment and notices that the relevant defendants have indicated to lodge appeals. The case should be handled in accordance with judicial procedures.",

            "就有市民今日（八月二十日）就刑期覆核案舉行的遊行，香港特區政府發言人作以下回應：",
            "香港特區成立二十年來，市民的言論、示威、集會等自由和權利一直受到《基本法》保障，而法治精神和司法獨立更是「一國兩制」成功的要素，並廣受國際認同。特區政府和市民同樣尊重和維護這些核心價值。",
            "就今次上訴法庭處理黃之鋒、羅冠聰和周永康刑期覆核一案，正如律政司早前清楚說明，案件是依據《檢控守則》、適用法律和證據作出檢控和上訴決定，完全不存在任何政治考慮。再者，指控法庭受政治干預是完全沒有理據和基礎的。我們留意到香港大律師公會和香港律師會的聯合聲明，指出上述指控的謬誤。",
            "事實上，法庭就此案接受律政司的刑期覆核正代表其申請有充分的法律理據。換言之，案件由決定檢控到定罪，以至律政司申請覆核刑期和上訴法庭的判決，完全是按本港行之有效的法律制度進行。",
