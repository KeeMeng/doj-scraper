Secondly, do you have other properties that have illegal structures? What do you think of the NPC's (National People's Congress's) Decision, do you think that can be challenged in court?",

The second question is about other properties. Yes, there are other properties. I have already said just now that I have already engaged Authorized Person to look into them and being dealt with. As to the NPC's (Standing Committee of the NPC's) Decision, the Decision that was made at the end of the year, that is a matter that has been made. It has been made under the PRC (People's Republic of China) constitution law. This is a matter that is subject to certain judicial review proceedings, so it is not appropriate for me to comment any further on that.",

            "記者：司長，我想請問，你剛才表示絕對無不尊重立法會，你會否主動就僭建一事到立法會見議員交代？因為現在立法會希望邀請你上去交代事件而請不到，他們最後沒有批准。你自己會否主動親身去，以顯示你的誠意向立法會議員和公眾交代？另外，大家現在都很關注，姚松炎是否符合資格參選今屆立法會，你可否交代此事？",
            "律政司司長：就姚松炎的情況，我們正在做研究，看法律的情況如何。至於立法會方面，我們本來說了二月二十六日，但若我能早一些把工作計劃完成，我會提早去做。",
            "記者：不是司法panel（司法及法律事務委員會），而是另外再主動出席內會或在大會上交代，你會否顯示你的誠意，用這些行動去做？司長可否回答？會否顯示誠意，出席司法panel以外的panel，交代僭建這件事？可否回應以顯示你的誠意？",
            "律政司司長：其實這個有它的相關程序，我現在不方便在此說，而可能是在適當的方法時，我們會用適當的時間處理。",
            "記者：司長，為何你的按揭文件並無地庫，但你仍簽署那份文件？你是否騙取銀行的按揭？另外，你自己表示買樓時沒有圖則，但你買樓的時候不看圖則，你如何說服香港人，在推動政策時，你會看文件？此外，你是否有其他物業是有僭建？",
            "律政司司長：我是這個物業的業主，所以它有僭建，以及我無做檢視和處理工作，我就這個物業的事情一定有責任，所以我在此再與大家說，就這件事我深表歉意，亦鄭重在此向大家再次道歉，希望大家將我們的工作和香港的事情回到很多重要的議題上。",
