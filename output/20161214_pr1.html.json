            "Following is the translation of the speech made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in moving the second reading of the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2016 at the Legislative Council meeting today (December 14):",
            "Mr President,",
            "I move that the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2016 (the Bill) be read the second time. The main objective of the Bill is to amend the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) so as to clarify that disputes over intellectual property rights (IPRs) may be resolved by arbitration and that it is not contrary to the public policy of Hong Kong to enforce arbitral awards involving IPRs.",
            "Arbitrability of IPR disputes",
            "It has been the consistent policy of the Government to enhance Hong Kong's status as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services and a premier hub for intellectual property (IP) trading in the Asia Pacific region. Both the Department of Justice and the Working Group on IP Trading have identified IP arbitration as one of the areas in which Hong Kong should develop and promote.",
            "Arbitrability of the subject matter of a dispute is an important issue which ought to be clear before the commencement of arbitration. However, the Arbitration Ordinance presently does not have any specific provision dealing with the question of arbitrability of disputes over IPRs (IPR disputes). There is no authoritative judgment in Hong Kong concerning the arbitrability of IPR disputes either. Hence, the law as it now stands is not entirely clear in this respect. In fact, different jurisdictions have adopted different approaches on this issue.",
            "In view of this, the Department of Justice set up a Working Group on Arbitrability of IPRs last year to, among others, consider and advise the Government on whether there is any need to introduce legislative amendments to address the issue of arbitrability of IPR disputes and, if so, the extent to which it is necessary to do so. The Working Group comprised representatives from the Department of Justice, Intellectual Property Department, Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre and legal practitioners with expertise in the area. Following the work of the Working Group and consultation with relevant stakeholders, the Government believes that specific statutory provisions on the issue of arbitrability of IPR disputes would serve to clarify the legal position and would facilitate more parties to resolve their IPR disputes through arbitration in Hong Kong. This would help promote Hong Kong as a leading international arbitration centre and give Hong Kong an edge over other jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region as a venue for resolving IPR disputes.",
            "Main Amendments under the Bill",
            "Currently, Part 10 of the Arbitration Ordinance provides, among other things, that enforcement of an arbitral award may be refused if (i) the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of resolution by arbitration under the law of Hong Kong (arbitrability ground), or (ii) it would be contrary to public policy to enforce the award (public policy ground). Similarly, the courts may set aside an arbitral award under Part 9 of the Ordinance on either of these two grounds. There is some concern as to whether an arbitral award involving IPRs (particularly arbitral awards concerning the validity of registered IPRs) would be set aside or its enforcement refused in Hong Kong on either the arbitrability ground or the public policy ground.",
            "To put the matter beyond doubt, the Bill proposes to clarify that IPR disputes, whether they arise as the main issue or an incidental issue, are capable of resolution by arbitration. The Bill also proposes to clarify that an arbitral award relating to an IPR dispute, and the enforcement of such an award, is not contrary to the public policy of Hong Kong. The effect is that the courts will not set aside an arbitral award or refuse to enforce it under Part 9 or 10 of the Arbitration Ordinance on ground of arbitrability or public policy solely because the award involves IPRs.",
            "To facilitate the arbitration of international IPR disputes in Hong Kong, \"IPRs\" and \"IPR disputes\" under the Bill have a broad coverage and include an IPR whether or not it is protectible by registration and whether or not it is registered, or subsists, in Hong Kong.",
            "The Bill also introduces other related technical amendments.",
            "The Government believes that the proposed amendments to the Arbitration Ordinance would help (i) clarify any ambiguity in relation to the \"arbitrability of IPR disputes\"; (ii) make Hong Kong more appealing than other jurisdictions for conducting arbitration involving IPR disputes; and (iii) demonstrate to the international community that Hong Kong is committed to developing itself as an international centre for dispute resolution involving IPR matters as well as an IP trading hub in the region.",
            "Amendments to the Arbitration (Parties to New York Convention) Order",
            "In addition, we take this opportunity to amend the Schedule to the Arbitration (Parties to New York Convention) Order (Cap 609A) by adding Andorra and Comoros, two new parties to the New York Convention (Note). We also propose to amend the spelling of \"Faeroe Islands\" in the Schedule to \"Faroe Islands\" so as to tally with the spelling used in other statutory provisions.",
            "Consultation",
            "The Working Group on Arbitrability of IPRs supports the proposal to amend the Arbitration Ordinance so as to clarify that IPR disputes are capable of resolution by arbitration. The Government has also consulted stakeholders within the legal, arbitration and IP fields on the Bill. The consultees did not raise in-principle objection to the introduction of the Bill. Some comments on the Bill raised by the consultees have been carefully considered by the Government and taken on board where appropriate. In addition, the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services was consulted early this year, and indicated support for the introduction of amendments to clarify the position.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Mr President, in order to further enhance Hong Kong’s position as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region, the Department of Justice has been reviewing the arbitration regime of Hong Kong from time to time and will also consider improvement to the Arbitration Ordinance as and when appropriate. We believe that the Bill, when enacted, will make Hong Kong one of the first movers to clarify the arbitrability of IPR disputes by legislation, thereby enhancing Hong Kong's position as a leading international arbitration centre and an IP trading hub in the Asia Pacific region.",
            "With these remarks, I urge Members to support the Bill.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（十二月十四日）在立法會會議上動議二讀《2016年仲裁（修訂）條例草案》致辭全文：",
            "主席：",
            "我謹動議二讀《2016年仲裁（修訂）條例草案》。《條例草案》的主要目的，是修訂《仲裁條例》（第609章），澄清有關知識產權權利（知識產權）的爭議可以透過仲裁解決，以及澄清強制執行涉及知識產權的仲裁裁決，並不違反香港公共政策。",
            "知識產權爭議可否透過仲裁解決",
            "政府的一貫政策，是提升香港作為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心，以及區內首屈一指的知識產權貿易中心的地位。律政司及知識產權貿易工作小組均認為知識產權仲裁是香港應發展及推廣的其中一個範疇。",
            "爭議事項可否透過仲裁解決這重要問題，應在仲裁展開之前釐清。然而，《仲裁條例》現時並無針對知識產權爭議可否透過仲裁解決的具體條文。此外，香港亦沒有關於知識產權可否以仲裁解決的權威性判決。因此，現行法律在這方面並不完全清晰。事實上，不同司法管轄區就這個問題亦採取不同做法。",
            "有鑑於此，律政司於去年成立了「關於知識產權的可仲裁性工作小組」，研究是否有需要針對知識產權爭議的可仲裁性問題修訂法例，以及（如有的話）所需修訂的範圍等問題，並向政府提供意見。工作小組由律政司、知識產權署及香港國際仲裁中心的代表，以及具備這範疇專業知識的法律執業者組成。經工作小組研究及在諮詢持份者後，政府相信，如就知識產權爭議可否以仲裁解決的問題制訂具體法例條文，可以釐清法律狀況，藉此促使更多當事人在香港透過仲裁方式解決知識產權爭議。這有助推廣香港成為亞太區主要國際仲裁中心，並突顯香港在解決知識產權爭議方面較亞太區其他司法管轄區更具優勢。",
            "《條例草案》的主要修訂",
            "目前，《仲裁條例》第10部訂明的事宜包括，如有以下情況，可拒絕強制執行仲裁裁決：（i）根據香港法律，該裁決所關乎的事宜不能藉仲裁解決（可仲裁性理由）；或（ii）強制執行該裁決，會違反公共政策（公共政策理由）。同樣地，根據《仲裁條例》第9部，法院可基於上述兩項理由撤銷仲裁裁決。這令人關注到，涉及知識產權的仲裁裁決（特別是關乎已註冊的知識產權的有效性問題）會否因可仲裁性理由或公共政策理由，而在香港遭拒絕強制執行或被撤銷。",
            "為釋除疑慮，《條例草案》建議澄清，任何知識產權爭議（不論屬有關仲裁的主要爭論點還是附帶爭論點），均可透過仲裁解決。《條例草案》亦建議澄清，有關知識產權爭議的仲裁裁決，以及強制執行該裁決，並不違反香港的公共政策。換言之，仲裁裁決將不會僅因涉及知識產權，而根據《仲裁條例》第9或第10部，基於可仲裁性理由或公共政策理由，在香港被撤銷或遭拒絕強制執行。",
            "為促進在香港進行國際知識產權爭議的仲裁，《條例草案》中「知識產權」及「知識產權爭議」的涵蓋範圍寬闊，不論某項知識產權可否經註冊而受到保護，及不論該項知識產權是否於香港註冊或於香港存在。",
            "《條例草案》亦載有其他相關技術性修訂。",
            "政府相信，修訂《仲裁條例》的建議可：（i）有助澄清 「知識產權爭議的可仲裁性」的任何含糊之處；（ii）有助提升香港作為知識產權爭議的仲裁地點，相對於其他司法管轄區的吸引力；以及（iii）有助向國際社會顯示，香港有決心發展成為解決知識產權爭議的國際中心及區內知識產權貿易中心。",
            "修訂《仲裁（紐約公約締約方）令》",
            "再者，條例亦修訂《仲裁（紐約公約締約方）令》（第609章，附屬法例A）的附表，加入兩名《紐約公約》（註）的新締約方，即安道爾（Andorra）及科摩羅（Comoros）。此外，我們亦建議將附表內〝Faeroe Islands〞的英文拼寫修訂為〝Faroe Islands〞，務求與其他法例條文的拼寫達成一致。",
            "諮詢",
            "關於知識產權的可仲裁性工作小組支持修訂《仲裁條例》，以澄清知識產權爭議可藉仲裁解決。特區政府亦已就《條例草案》的上述修改建議，徵詢法律、仲裁及知識產權業界的意見。他們對提出《條例草案》均沒有原則性的反對。至於被諮詢者就草案提出的意見，政府已審慎考慮，而合適的亦已被接納。此外，政府於本年初諮詢司法及法律事務委員會。委員會表示支持提出修訂以澄清法律狀況。",
            "結語",
            "主席，為進一步提升香港作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位，律政司不時檢討香港仲裁制度，亦會適時考慮對《仲裁條例》作出改進。我們相信《條例草案》獲得通過後，將讓香港成為透過立法方式澄清知識產權爭議可以仲裁解決的先驅之一，從而進一步提升香港作為亞太區主要國際仲裁中心及知識產權貿易中心的地位。",
