            "Different views have been expressed in recent days by individuals and groups in society about the Decision adopted by the Standing Committee (NPCSC) of the National People's Congress (NPC) on December 27 on the implementation of co-location arrangement at the West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (Decision), and the Explanations on the draft Decision provided by Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Zhang Xiaoming, (Explanations). Among those views include the statement issued by the Hong Kong Bar Association as well as views expressed by individual members of society in the media. In response to media enquiry on those views, the HKSAR Government provides the following consolidated response:",
            "First, the HKSAR Government fully respects the rule of law. At the same time, it respects the Constitution of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the basic policy of \"one country, two systems\" as well as the Basic Law of the HKSAR. The HKSAR Government reiterates that in the course of the consultations on co-location arrangement, both sides have always agreed that the co-location arrangement must be consistent with \"one country, two systems\" and must not contravene the Basic Law. HKSAR Government officials have also stated in the past that \"one country, two systems\" will not be harmed or the Basic Law contravened just for the sake of promoting convenience or enhancing economic benefits and efficiency. It is precisely for this reason that the two sides have over the past period of time repeatedly studied different co-location arrangement options as well as the legal issues involved, including the different views in society on relevant provisions of the Basic Law such as Articles 7, 18, 19, 20 and 22. Therefore, there is absolutely no question of the Constitution, the Basic Law or \"one country, two systems\" being disregarded or disrespected just because the subject matter concerns \"a good thing\".",
            "On the contrary, on the basis of respecting the Constitution, the Basic Law and \"one country, two systems\", the SAR and the Mainland have adopted the \"Three-step Process\" in taking forward the co-location arrangement. Step One of the \"Three-step Process\" reflects the enjoyment of a high degree of autonomy by the SAR and reflects the fact that neither the SAR nor the Mainland can implement co-location arrangement on its own. Step Two, apart from respecting the PRC Constitution and the constitutional status of the NPCSC, can also ensure that the co-location arrangement is ultimately consistent with the Basic Law. Step Three, through the local legislative process, fully reflects the autonomy of the SAR in handling co-location arrangement.",
            "Second, views have been expressed that the Decision made by the NPCSC does not explain the legal basis or is lacking in it. However, both the Decision itself and the Explanations of Director Zhang Xiaoming have explained the legal basis of the Decision. Chairman of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the NPCSC, Li Fei, further explained the legal basis of the Decision at the press conference held after the adoption of the Decision. Legal experts often have different views on the same issue, so it is naturally understandable that different persons may have different views about the legal reasoning behind the Decision, but this does not mean the Decision has no legal basis.",
            "Third, co-location arrangement involves enabling Mainland personnel to conduct procedures for exit and entry on high-speed rail passengers at the West Kowloon Station Mainland Port Area. Some have queried whether such arrangement would contravene Article 18 of the Basic Law. Although Article 18 of the Basic Law stipulates that national laws shall not be applied in the HKSAR except for those listed in Annex III to the Basic Law, the Explanations and Chairman Li Fei have explained the two main reasons why the co-location arrangement does not contravene Article 18 of the Basic Law:",
            "(1) What Article 18 of the Basic Law prescribes is the extension and application of national laws in the entire HKSAR. In short, the area of application of the relevant national laws stipulated in Article 18 of the Basic Law is the entire HKSAR; they are implemented by the HKSAR itself and they are applicable to all persons in the HKSAR. However, the situation of co-location arrangement is clearly different from that prescribed under Article 18 of the Basic Law. When implementing co-location arrangement, the area of application of the national laws is only confined to the Mainland Port Area at the West Kowloon Station. The national laws are implemented by the relevant Mainland authorities and they are mainly applicable to high-speed rail passengers present in the Mainland Port Area.",
            "(2) The Co-operation Arrangement expressly provides that, for the purposes of the application of the laws of the Mainland and the delineation of jurisdiction, the West Kowloon Station Mainland Port Area will be regarded as \"being situated in the Mainland\". Therefore, as a matter of law, Article 18 of the Basic Law no longer applies. Similar provision has been used for the co-location model at the Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Port Area, and \"deeming provisions\" of a similar nature can also be found in other legal contexts from time to time. Moreover, since the NPCSC has approved the Co-operation Arrangement, this also provides legal basis for the above provision.",
            "There are also views in society that the present Decision amounts to an announcement that the Co-operation Arrangement complies with the Constitution and the Basic Law \"just because the NPCSC says so\", and there are even views that this amounts to the \"rule of man\". The HKSAR Government and members of society understand that under every system, there will be (and must be) an organ of highest and ultimate authority. Under \"one country, two systems\", the HKSAR enjoys a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the Basic Law, but it must also respect the PRC Constitution as well as the status and powers of the NPCSC under the constitutional order of the State.",
            "The NPC is the highest organ of state power, whereas the NPCSC is the NPC's permanent body. The entire process leading to the adoption of the present Decision by the NPCSC, which involves the SAR signing the Co-operation Arrangement with the Mainland, followed by submission by the State Council to the NPCSC for examination, and then, following deliberations in group meetings, the adoption of the Decision by the NPCSC by voting, is fully consistent with the constitutional process of the State. In other words, the present Decision is a decision made entirely pursuant to the PRC Constitution and related procedures. It has legal effect and is not a mere executive decision as suggested by some. Nor is it a case of \"just because someone says so\", not to mention a case of \"rule of man\" or a retrograde step in the implementation of the Basic Law. Moreover, in the course of the local legislative process under the Third Step, Legislative Council Members and different sectors of society will have the opportunity to discuss the relevant issues, and it is ultimately up to Legislative Council Members to decide whether to enact the local legislation thereby implementing co-location arrangement.",
            "Finally, co-location arrangement is a matter that must be dealt with in light of the developments in the communication and transportation systems. For the high-speed rail passengers who use the procedures for exit and entry under co-location arrangement, the procedures and their rights are basically the same as those under the traditional \"separate location\" arrangement. The main difference is that co-location arrangement is more convenient and efficient. It is hoped that members of society can understand co-location arrangement and related matters in an objective, pragmatic and all-rounded manner.",

            "近日社會上不同人士和團體對全國人民代表大會（全國人大）常務委員會（全國人大常委會）於本月二十七日就於廣深港高鐵西九龍站落實「一地兩檢」所作的《決定》（《決定》），以及國務院港澳事務辦公室主任張曉明就《決定》草案作出的《說明》（《說明》）提出不同意見，當中包括香港大律師公會的聲明，和個別社會人士透過傳媒發表的意見。回應傳媒就上述意見的查詢，香港特區政府現作整體回應︰",
            "首先，特區政府尊重法治，同時亦尊重國家的《憲法》、「一國兩制」基本政策方針，以及香港特區的《基本法》。特區政府重申，雙方在商討「一地兩檢」時一直同意「一地兩檢」的安排必須符合「一國兩制」和不違反《基本法》。過往特區政府官員亦曾表示不會單純為促使便捷或提高經濟效益而破壞「一國兩制」或違反《基本法》。正因如此，雙方在過去一段時間反覆研究不同的「一地兩檢」方案，以及當中涉及的法律問題，包括社會上對《基本法》第7條、第18條、第19條、第20條和第22條等相關條文的不同觀點。因此，絕對不存在為了做「好事情」而漠視《憲法》、《基本法》或「一國兩制」的情況。",
            "相反，在尊重《憲法》、《基本法》，以及「一國兩制」的基礎上，特區及內地採用「三步走」方式去落實「一地兩檢」。「三步走」的第一步既體現特區享有高度自治權，亦反映「一地兩檢」並非特區或內地能單獨落實的安排。第二步除尊重國家《憲法》和全國人大常委會的憲制地位外，亦能確保「一地兩檢」最終符合《基本法》。第三步則透過特區本地立法的程序充分體現特區在處理「一地兩檢」安排上的自主權。",
            "第二，有意見指全國人大常委會作出的《決定》沒有說明或欠缺法理基礎。然而，《決定》本身和張曉明主任所作的《說明》均有解述《決定》的法理基礎。全國人大常委會香港特別行政區基本法委員會主任李飛在《決定》獲通過後舉行的新聞發布會亦就《決定》的法理基礎作進一步解說。法律專家對同一問題往往有不同看法，因此不同人士對《決定》背後的法律理據有各自的看法當然可以理解，但不代表《決定》沒有法律基礎。",
            "第三，「一地兩檢」涉及讓內地人員在西九龍站「內地口岸區」依內地法律為高鐵乘客辦理出入境手續。有意見質疑此安排會違反《基本法》第18條。雖然《基本法》第18條規定全國性法律除列入《基本法》附件三者外，不在香港特別行政區實施，但《說明》及李飛主任已解述「一地兩檢」不會違反《基本法》第18條的兩個主要原因︰",
            "（一）《基本法》第18條規範的是全國性法律延伸適用至整個香港特區的情況。簡言之，《基本法》第18條規定中有關全國性法律實施的範圍是整個香港特區，實施主體是香港特區本身，適用對象是香港特區的所有人。但「一地兩檢」的情況明顯與《基本法》第18條所規範的情況截然不同。在落實「一地兩檢」時，全國性法律的實施範圍只限於西九龍站「內地口岸區」，實施主體是內地有關機構，適用對象主要是處於「內地口岸區」的高鐵乘客。",
            "（二）《合作安排》明確規定，就內地法律的適用以及管轄權的劃分而言，西九龍站「內地口岸區」將被視為「處於內地」，因此在法理上《基本法》第18條不再適用。相類似的條文在深圳灣港方口岸的「一地兩檢」模式亦有採用，而性質類似的「視為條款」亦不時在其他法律範疇有出現。再者，由於全國人大常委會批准《合作安排》，因此亦為上述條文提供法律依據。",
            "社會上亦有意見指稱是次《決定》等同「但凡全國人大常委會所說符合的便是符合」，更甚至有意見指是「人治」。特區政府及社會人士明白，在每一個制度下必會（亦必須）有一個最高、最終權力機關。在「一國兩制」下，香港特區依據《基本法》享有高度自治，但亦必須尊重國家《憲法》和全國人大常委會在國家憲制中的地位和權力。",
            "全國人大是最高國家權力機關，而全國人大常委會是全國人大的常設機關。是次全國人大常委會作出《決定》的整個過程，由特區與內地簽訂《合作安排》，然後由國務院提請全國人大常委會審議，最後經分組討論後由全國人大常委會投票通過作出《決定》，完全符合國家憲制程序。換言之，是次《決定》是完全依據國家《憲法》及相關程序而作出的決定，具有法律效力，並非有意見指《決定》只為行政決定，亦不是「某人說了算」的情況，更遑論是「人治」或落實《基本法》的倒退。再者，在第三步的本地立法程序中，立法會議員及社會各界均有機會討論相關議題，並最終由立法會議員決定是否通過本地法，從而落實「一地兩檢」。",
            "最後，「一地兩檢」是因應交通、運輸系統發展而必須處理的事宜。高鐵乘客以「一地兩檢」方式辦理出入境手續、程序和權利基本上與傳統「兩地兩檢」沒有分別，最重要的分別是「一地兩檢」更便捷有效。因此希望社會各界能客觀、務實、全面地去理解「一地兩檢」安排及相關事宜。",
