            "Following is a question by the Hon Claudia Mo and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (July 15):",
            "Question:",
            "Certain provisions of the Basic Law, which make references to the common law, stipulate among other things that: the laws previously in force in Hong Kong which shall be maintained include the common law (Article 8), reference may be made to precedents of other common law jurisdictions in the adjudication of cases in accordance with the laws (Article 84), and the Court of Final Appeal may as required invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit on the Court of Final Appeal (Article 82). On the other hand, pursuant to Article 18 of the Basic Law, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the National Security Law) was added to the list of national laws in Annex III to the Basic Law and applied in Hong Kong by promulgation on the 30th of last month. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it has studied if the aforesaid Basic Law provisions, which are related to the common law, are applicable to the criminal proceedings instituted under the national laws (including the National Security Law) listed in Annex III to the Basic Law; and",
            "(2) of the justifications for the Secretary for Justice to make the following statement: \"it is impracticable and unreasonable to expect that everything in a national law, the National Security Law, will be exactly as what a statute in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region common law jurisdiction would be like\"?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The National People's Congress (NPC) adopted the Decision of the National People's Congress on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanisms for Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Decision) on May 28, 2020. Paragraph 6 of the Decision authorises the Standing Committee of the NPC (NPCSC) to enact relevant laws on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The NPCSC adopted unanimously on June 30, 2020 The Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKNSL) in accordance with the Constitution, the Basic Law and the NPC Decision, and added it to Annex III to the Basic Law in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Law on the same day after consulting the Basic Law Committee and the HKSAR Government. The Chief Executive then gave notice that the HKNSL applied in the HKSAR from 11 pm on the same day.",
            "Article 1 of the HKNSL declares at the outset that the HKNSL is enacted for the purpose of \"ensuring the resolute, full and faithful implementation of the policy of One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy; safeguarding national security; preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for the offences of secession, subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security in relation to the HKSAR; maintaining prosperity and stability of the HKSAR; and protecting the lawful rights and interests of the residents of the HKSAR\".",
            "The HKNSL is divided into six chapters: general principles; the duties and the government bodies of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security; offences and penalties; jurisdiction, applicable law and procedure; office for safeguarding national security of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR; and supplementary provisions, with 66 sections in total. It is a comprehensive piece of legislation comprising substantive law, procedural law and organisation law.",
            "The Department of Justice now provides the following detailed reply to the questions raised by the Hon Claudia Mo.",
            "(1) Article 41, paragraph 1, of the HKNSL provides that the HKNSL and the laws of the HKSAR shall apply to procedural matters, including those related to criminal investigation, prosecution, trial, and execution of penalty, in respect of cases concerning offence endangering national security over which the Region exercises jurisdiction. Article 45 provides that unless otherwise provided by the HKNSL, magistrates' courts, the District Court, the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal shall handle proceedings in relation to the prosecution for offences endangering national security in accordance with the laws of the HKSAR.",
            "The HKSAR largely applies existing local laws and procedure when exercising jurisdiction over offences endangering national security in accordance with the HKNSL. It is true that the HKNSL makes different provisions for the legal procedure under certain special circumstances, but they are necessary for the prevention of, suppression of, and imposition of punishment for acts endangering national security given the special nature of cases involving national security.",
            "The Basic Law was enacted by the NPC in accordance with Articles 31 and 62 of the Constitution. It is a national law that applies in Hong Kong, prescribing the systems to be practised in the HKSAR, in order to ensure the implementation of the basic polices of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong. The HKNSL is a national law enacted by the NPCSC in accordance with the authority delegated by the NPC Decision specifically for the establishment and improvement of the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR. It is listed in Annex III to the Basic Law by the NPCSC and applies in the HKSAR by way of promulgation.",
            "The local laws of the HKSAR consists of the laws previously in force in Hong Kong referred to in Article 8 of the Basic Law, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law, except for any that contravene the Basic Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the HKSAR. On February 23, 1997, the NPCSC adopted a Decision on the treatment of the laws previously in force in Hong Kong in accordance with Article 160 of the Basic Law. According to that Decision, some of the ordinances and subordinate legislation previously in force in Hong Kong were not adopted as the laws of the HKSAR. In addition, local laws also include laws enacted by the legislature of the HKSAR in exercise of the legislative power under Article 73 of the Basic Law.",
            "Article 62 of the HKNSL provides that the HKNSL shall prevail where the provisions of the local laws of the HKSAR are inconsistent with the HKNSL. As stated above, local laws of the HKSAR mean the laws previously in force in Hong Kong, including the common law, referred to in Article 8 of the Basic Law as well as laws enacted by the legislature of the HKSAR. Hence, in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the Basic Law, Article 84 provides that precedents of other common law jurisdictions may be referred to by the courts of the HKSAR when adjudicating cases. Article 82 of the Basic Law which provides that the Court of Final Appeal may as required invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit on the Court continues to apply.",
            "(2) The HKNSL is a special and innovative national law because it comprises three different types of laws, namely, an organisation law which establishes the relevant responsible bodies, a substantive law which provides for offences and penalties, and a procedural law in relation to law enforcement, prosecution and trial. Although the HKNSL is a national law enacted by the NPCSC, it has taken into account the differences between the legal systems of the State and the HKSAR. Many provisions are included to ensure that the HKNSL and local laws are reconcilable, compatible and complementary with each other. The common purpose of these two major characteristics is to ensure that the laws on safeguarding national security can be fully and effectively enforced in the HKSAR. Hence, one cannot demand that the legal provisions of the HKNSL are drafted in the language of Hong Kong common law.",

            "（一）有否研究，上述與普通法有關的《基本法》條文，是否適用於根據列於《基本法》附件三的全國性法律（包括《國安法》）提起的刑事訴訟；及",

            "全國人民代表大會（全國人大）在五月二十八日通過《全國人民代表大會關於建立健全香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的決定》（《決定》）。《決定》第六條授權全國人大常務委員會（全國人大常委會）就建立健全香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制制定相關法律。全國人大常委會根據《憲法》、《基本法》和全國人大的《決定》，制定《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》（《港區國安法》），在六月三十日全票通過，並於同日根據《基本法》第十八條，經徵詢基本法委員會和特區政府意見後，將《港區國安法》列入《基本法》附件三，繼而由行政長官公布自同日晚上十一時起在特區實施。",
            "《港區國安法》第一條開宗明義指出，制定該法的目的是「為堅定不移並全面準確貫徹『一國兩制』、『港人治港』、高度自治的方針，維護國家安全，防範、制止和懲治與香港特別行政區有關的分裂國家、顛覆國家政權、組織實施恐怖活動和勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全等犯罪，保持香港特別行政區的繁榮和穩定，保障香港特別行政區居民的合法權益」。",
            "《港區國安法》有六章，分別為總則；香港特別行政區維護國家安全的職責和機構；罪行和處罰；案件管轄、法律適用和程序；中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全機構；以及附則；共六十六條。這是一部兼具實體法、程序法和組織法內容的綜合性法律。",
            "就毛孟靜議員的具體提問，律政司現詳細回覆如下。",
            "（一）《港區國安法》第四十一條第一款規定，香港特別行政區管轄的危害國家安全犯罪案件的立案偵查、檢控、審判和刑罰的執行等訴訟程序事宜，適用該法和香港特別行政區本地法律。第四十五條規定，除該法另有規定外，裁判法院、區域法院、高等法院和終審法院應當按照香港特別行政區的其他法律處理就危害國家安全犯罪案件提起的刑事檢控程序。",
            "特區依據《港區國安法》就危害國家安全犯罪案件行使管轄權時，大致上都是沿用本地現行的法律及程序。當然，《港區國安法》就某些特別情況下的法律程序作出不同的規定，但這些規定都是因應涉及國家安全案件的特殊性質，為了有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪行為而必需作出的。",
            "《基本法》是全國人大根據《憲法》第三十一條及第六十二條制定的適用於香港的全國性法律，規定香港特別行政區實行的制度，以保障國家對香港的基本方針政策的實施。而《港區國安法》是全國人大常委會根據全國人大《決定》授權通過的專門為了建立健全特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的全國性法律，由全國人大常委會列於附件三，並在特區公布實施。",
            "香港特區的本地法律有《基本法》第八條所指的原有法律，即普通法、衡平法、條例、附屬立法和習慣法，除同《基本法》相抵觸或經香港特別行政區的立法機關作出修改者外，予以保留。全國人大常委會於一九九七年二月二十三日根據《基本法》第一百六十條通過處理香港原有法律的決定。根據該決定，部分原有條例和附屬立法不被採用為特區法律。另外，本地法律也包括特區立法機關行使《基本法》第七十三條的立法權制定的法律。",
            "《港區國安法》第六十二條規定特區本地法律規定與本法不一致的，適用本法規定。如上所述，特區本地法律指《基本法》第八條提及的包括普通法的香港原有法律及立法機關制定的法律。因此，按照《基本法》第八條的規定，第八十四條規定其他普通法適用地區的司法判例可在特區法院審判案件時作為參考。《基本法》第八十二條有關終審法院可根據需要邀請其他普通法適用地區的法官參加審判的條文仍然適用。",
            "（二）《港區國安法》是一部獨特和具開創性的全國性法律，因為它同時兼具了三大類法律，即設立相關負責機構的「組織法」、訂定罪行和罰則的「實體法」，以及與執法、檢控和審訊相關的「程序法」。《港區國安法》雖然是全國人大常委會制定的全國性法律，但當中也兼顧了國家和特區兩個法律制度的差異，不少條文都是為了處理好《港區國安法》與本地法律的銜接、兼容和互補關係。這兩大特色的共同目的就是要確保維護國家安全的法律能在特區切實有效執行。因此，並不可能要求《港區國安法》的法律條文全部依照香港普通法的法律行文。",

            "《港區國安法》雖然是全國人大常委會制定的全國性法律，但當中也兼顧了國家和特區兩個法律制度的差異，不少條文都是為了處理好《港區國安法》與本地法律的銜接、兼容和互補關係",
            "這兩大特色的共同目的就是要確保維護國家安全的法律能在特區切實有效執行",
            "因此，並不可能要求《港區國安法》的法律條文全部依照香港普通法的法律行文",
            "多謝主席",
