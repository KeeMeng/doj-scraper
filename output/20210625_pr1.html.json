            "The \"Why Invest in Hong Kong - A Look to the Future\" webinar was held successfully today (June 25). The event is the last session of the \"Why Hong Kong\" webinar series, co-organised by the Department of Justice, the Asian Academy of International Law and Invest Hong Kong, to showcase Hong Kong's strength and to illustrate Hong Kong's irreplaceable role to the international community.",
            "The webinar was attended by prominent legal professionals and renowned business leaders who deliberated on various promising prospects of investing in Hong Kong - the indispensable nexus between China and the world. Chairman of Fung Group and 2022 Foundation, Dr Victor Fung, delivered the keynote speech on \"Window of Opportunity: The Greater Bay Area - Creating Hong Kong's Long-Term Competitiveness\". He remarked that with the sturdy foundation of Hong Kong as a global financial centre and an international legal hub for deal-making and dispute resolution, it is beyond doubt that yet more investors around the world shall be drawn to this vibrant city.",
            "The three panel discussions at the webinar addressed the pivotal topics of \"Investing in and through Hong Kong\", \"Investment Infrastructure in Hong Kong - New Initiatives in Legal and Finance\" and \"Hong Kong Going Forward in the Wake of China's Future Development\". The discussions provided valuable insights as to how Hong Kong could grasp the opportunities brought about by the 14th Five-year Plan and the Greater Bay Area.",
            "The \"Why Hong Kong\" series comprising four webinars answered some \"Why Hong Kong\" questions, and further promoted the international community's understanding of Hong Kong's unique advantages, which in turn strengthens confidence in Hong Kong's long-term economic development and competitiveness.",

            "出席研討會的知名法律專業人士和商界領袖，討論和分享香港作為中國和世界不可或缺的連結，所提供的各種充滿前景的機遇。馮氏集團主席及2022基金會主席馮國經博士以「抓緊良機：大灣區——創造香港長遠競爭力」為題發表主題演說，指出香港作為全球金融中心和促成交易及爭議解決的國際法律樞紐，具有堅實的根基，毫無疑問會吸引更多世界各地的投資者。",
            "研討會的三場小組討論環節，探討「到香港或經香港投資」、「香港投資基建——法律與金融新措施」以及「中國未來發展下的香港前路」三個重點議題，就香港如何把握「十四五」規劃和粵港澳大灣區發展帶來的機遇，提供寶貴的意見和觀點。",
