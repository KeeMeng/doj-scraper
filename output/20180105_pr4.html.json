            "The Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam; the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC; and the Secretary for Justice (designate), Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, met the media this morning (January 5). Following is the transcript of remarks of the question-and-answer session:",
            "Reporter: Mrs Lam, how difficult was it for you to find the successor, and do you think Ms Cheng is tough enough to handle controversial issues like the legislation of Article 23? And a question for Mr Yuen, if you were to name one thing you've done during your term as SJ that you regret most, what would it be? Thank you.",
            "Chief Executive: Well, I would not comment or disclose on the process of approaching potential candidates in forming my team. I have said this half a year ago and I am saying this again. I have every confidence that Teresa, with her long service in both the legal sector and the non-legal sector, will be able to fully discharge the duties of the Secretary for Justice. I cannot answer the latter question on behalf of him.",
            "Secretary for Justice: Thank you for your questions. I think in the course of the past five and a half years or so, of course I have made various decisions and done various aspects of work. There are bound to be differences of opinion in relation to all those matters. But I think in all those cases, hand on heart, I can tell you that on each and every occasion, the ultimate decision was made in accordance with the law. We understand that people would have perhaps very divergent views. In my post, my belief has all along been that we have to stick to legal principles even though we know that some people may not like our decisions, because otherwise there would be situations where one would be acting contrary to the rule of law if one were not acting strictly according to legal principles.",

            "行政長官林鄭月娥今日（一月五日）上午與律政司司長袁國強資深大律師及候任律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師會見傳媒。以下是答問全文：",
            "記者：「佔中」案件至今還未完結，以及有很多主要參與者還未被檢控，但袁司長在這時提早離任，會否覺得有些好像留下一些「手尾」跟、不負責任？以及有甚麼促使你一定要提早離任？以及想問問鄭若驊女士，就是你將接手「佔中」案這個燙手山芋時，你會如何處理？會不會加快檢控工作？",
            "行政長官：讓我嘗試回答這問題。就第二個問題，鄭若驊資深大律師明天才接任律政司司長，所以今日要她回答有關特區政府的政策或個案不太適合，我相信Teresa在日後的工作會很願意面對傳媒，正如Rimsky一樣，在需要時會回答大家的提問。至於袁司長的決定或他現時手上的工作，大家都知道特區政府或任何政府都有延續性，不可能說有朝一日做完所有工作才走，我也不期望將來我離開行政長官這個職位時，香港所有事都得到解決。但是我可以說，袁司長以個人理由請辭，我亦很尊重他的個人理由，我亦深信在新律政司司長的領導和整個律政司裏眾多同事的支持下，你所說的很多事情我們都會繼續有效落實及執行。",
            "記者：想問問鄭大律師為甚麼會在這個時候決定接任？有傳聞在半年前曾拒絕過。以及她會否做足這個任期，即是四年半任期？",
            "行政長官：我不會評論我在組班時候的過程，接觸過甚麼人士，但很肯定說，正如我剛才在開場白所說，我覺得鄭若驊資深大律師是非常適當的人選，我有充分信心，她可以履行律政司司長的職務。我們每一個人的任命，如果你回看中央人民政府的公布，都有一個生效日期，我們一直會按着已經生效的日期做我們的工作。大家都知道，每一屆政府，包括行政長官都是五年任期。",
