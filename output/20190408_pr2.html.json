            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at a media session after attending the special meeting of Finance Committee of the Legislative Council today (April 8):",
            "Reporter: Secretary, can you comment on this report that there might be an interpretation of Article 23 (of the Basic Law)? Secondly, on access to computer with criminal or dishonest intent, what is going to be done to sort of fill that gap in the law to prosecute some cybercrimes?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Thank you. I would not like to comment on speculative matters that have been reported, so if you would forgive me that I won't comment on that. However, it is very important to bear in mind that legislating for matters set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law is one of our constitutional duties, and therefore it is something that will be done. As the Chief Executive and the Government have repeatedly said, at an appropriate time that is something that we will have to do.",
            "As to the Section 161 (of the Crimes Ordinance), that relates to the improper use of the computer, the Court of Final Appeal's judgment has clarified the limits of this particular law, and therefore it is necessary for appropriate legislative changes to be made in order to ensure that the acts that are being prohibited, or be it outside the current legislation of Section 161 (of the Crimes Ordinance) can still be sanctioned in order to ensure that people's privacy and various matters are being protected. I think there are a number of things that can be happening, and we hope that this may result in a quick movement. First of all, no doubt the Security Bureau and the Department of Justice have already been working on reviewing the relevant legislations. As you know, there is the Review of Sexual Offences Sub-committee of the Law Reform Commission. Its first consultative report was produced in 2012 and the third one in 2018, so it may be possible that we may get some guidance or feedback on the first consultative report that came out, which may help us look into what is to be done. And of course, the Law Reform Commission has also set up a cybercrime sub-committee to review the legislations, if any, that need to be amended in order to keep up with the development of the laws in the fast-developing technology world.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（四月八日）出席立法會財務委員會特別會議後，與傳媒談話的內容：",
            "記者：今日有報道引述「權威消息」，指人大醞釀就（《基本法》）第二十三條立法和釋法，司長有沒有聽到這方面的消息？根據法理基礎，人大可否就香港未曾立法的法例主動進行釋法？",
            "律政司司長：我們不會就這些揣測性報道作出回應，我不想comment這件事情。不過大家都知道，（《基本法》）第二十三條（立法）的確是一項憲制責任，正如政府一直表示，我們找到適當的時間便會進行立法。",
            "記者：全體法律界選委今日有一個聯署，要求撤回《逃犯條例》，其實現在社會上普遍都擔心，政府會否考慮撤回條例？",
            "律政司司長：我相信保安局局長會聽到相關意見，他會作出適當的考慮。但我想在此強調，我們作為一個法治社會，必須要有一個制度，可以安排一個制度性的方法，安排逃犯移交回相關地方進行審訊。所以我們需要這樣的一套制度，希望大家明白到這一點的重要性。",
            "記者：但就台灣的案件，他們覺得有其他方法，不一定要修訂《逃犯條例》。",
            "律政司司長：其實從一個法治的角度來看，我們希望做的是一個制度，而不是因為某一件案件，我們便要立這樣一條法例，另外一件案件，又立另外一條法例。正如我記得，（保安局）局長亦曾提及，我覺得這是邏輯性的，若就一件謀殺案立一條條例，其他的案件又如何呢？所以希望大家從一個整體上我們需要一個制度的情況下，理解《逃犯條例》的修訂。",
            "記者：《逃犯條例》方面，有建議認為，可否參考廉政公署成立之初，就追溯期劃線。《逃犯條例》是否可以設立追溯期，可否設一個劃線安排，甚至不設立追溯期？",
            "律政司司長：《逃犯條例》整體安排的目的，是就一些涉嫌犯法的人士逃來香港，香港有一個制度可以按照法律，把他移交回相關地方。在此情況下，我們若這樣理解的話，則很難有一個安排可以去免除，正如他所說一個逃犯，當然是涉嫌犯了一些罪，才需要引用這個條例。",
            "記者：即是可否不設立追溯期，或者就追溯期劃線？",
            "律政司司長：逃犯一定是涉嫌犯了一些罪行而逃來香港，才適用於如何移交，所以在這個情況下，我們要就這一點清楚理解。",
