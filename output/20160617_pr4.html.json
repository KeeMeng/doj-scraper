            "Speaking at the event's opening ceremony, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said that \"Justice\" is the notion that all people cherish, and that all people have the right and duty to defend.",
            "\"Without an appropriate criminal justice regime and an effective operation thereof, law and order could not be maintained, those who deserve to be protected would be deprived of the necessary protection, and those who deserve to be punished would walk free,\" he said.",

            "\"Not only does the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR continue the common law tradition and thereby preserve the relevant common law safeguards, it contains express stipulations which provide the constitutional guarantee for the proper administration of criminal justice,\" he said.",
            "Echoing the observations made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, at the same occasion regarding the situations where prosecutors were made targets of verbal abuses, Mr Yuen said a respect for the rule of law includes a respect for the system, which means that we should respect the different roles played by the different stakeholders.",
            "\"The public prosecutors have their duty to discharge, and so do the judges. Even if one does not agree to the stance of the prosecutors or the rulings or decisions made by judges, one should express their views in the proper manner instead of resorting to abuses or even personal attacks. Such wholly unjustified conduct, which unfortunately have surfaced recently, is the very antithesis of the rule of law and should never be endorsed,let alone encouraged.\" he said.",
            "Mr Yeung elaborated on the meaning of the three core values, that is, justice, independence and impartiality, to public prosecutors.",
            "\"We public prosecutors are ministers of justice,\" said Mr Yeung. \"On behalf of the community, prosecutors take on the important responsibility in ensuring that justice is dispensed with in equal measure and in an even-handed manner at all times.\"",
            "\"The decision whether or not to prosecute an individual or entity is always a crucial one, and it will only be taken after a prosecutor has fully evaluated the evidence and circumstances, and answered two questions in particular. First, is the evidence sufficient to justify instituting or continuing proceedings? Second, if it is, does the public interest require a prosecution to be pursued?\"",

            "由律政司刑事檢控科主辦的2016年檢控週今日（六月十七日）展開。今次檢控週的主題為「公義‧獨立‧持平」，旨在讓公眾人士更瞭解刑事檢控科的工作和香港的刑事司法制度。",
            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師在開幕禮上表示，「公義」是每個人都珍惜的核心價值，而所有人均有權利和義務去捍衛。",
            "他說：「如果沒有適當的刑事司法體制和其有效操作，我們將無法維持秩序；應當得到保護的人將失去應有的保護；反之，應當受到懲治的人將逃過法網。」",
            "袁國強指出，確保刑事司法制度有效運作的根本概念，在香港的法律制度中已經根深蒂固。",
            "他說：「香港特別行政區《基本法》不僅延續普通法的傳統，以及普通法下的保障，它還包含明確的規定，為確保刑事司法制度的有效運作提供憲制上的保障。」",
            "袁國強同意刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師在同一場合就有關檢控人員往往成為被侮辱對象的觀察，並指出尊重法治，包括尊重相關的制度，這意味着我們應尊重不同持份者所擔當的不同角色。",
            "「公職檢控人員有他們的職責，法官同樣有他們的職責。即使有人不同意檢控人員的觀點或法官作出的裁決或決定，亦應以適當的方式表達他們的意見，而不是訴諸侮辱，甚至人身攻擊。最近不幸出現這些完全無理的行為，確實是法治的對立面，既不應受到鼓勵，更絕不應得到認同。」",
            "楊家雄進一步闡述該三個核心價值，即公義、獨立和持平，對公職檢控人員的意義。",
            "他說：「我們身為公職檢控人員，是秉行公義者。」",
            "「檢控人員代表社會肩負重大職責，確保時刻以同等的尺度，不偏不倚地秉行公義。」",
            "他說：「對個人或實體提出檢控與否，向來都是重要決定。檢控人員在作出決定前，定會全面評估證據及情況，尤其須要回答兩條問題。首先，提出或繼續進行法律程序，證據是否充分？其次，即使證據充分，提出檢控是否符合公眾利益？」",
            "楊家雄指出，行使檢控酌情權，本質上就是作出判斷。作出判斷的依據，就只是法律、證據和《檢控守則》。",
            "他說：「我們本着社會的整體利益行事，並為此致力維護《基本法》所確立的檢控機關的獨立性。」",
            "他續說，公職檢控人員肩負着無懼無私、不偏不倚地行事的使命。他們無視不相關的因素，而僅以法律、證據及公眾利益為依歸。",
            "檢控週於六月二十日至二十四日舉行期間，將會舉辦講座、模擬法庭，及參觀律政司和法庭，以進一步提高公眾人士對刑事司法制度和公職檢控人員的工作的認識。",
            "早前刑事檢控科亦舉辦了是次檢控週的標語創作比賽，共收到718份中學生的參賽作品，頒獎儀式亦於今日的開幕禮上舉行。",
