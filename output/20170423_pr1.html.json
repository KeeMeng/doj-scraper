            "The Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said today (April 23) that mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters between the Mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is becoming increasingly important with the continuous development of the two jurisdictions. He further noted that the legal infrastructure and supporting facilities must cope with the development of society, and mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters is no exception.",
            "Mr Yuen was speaking at the opening ceremony of the conference co-organised by the Supreme People’s Court and the Department of Justice (DoJ) in Xian. The conference gathered experts in the judicial, legal and arbitration sectors from the two jurisdictions to review the development of mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters between the Mainland and the HKSAR and exchange views on the way forward.",
            "Mr Yuen said that Hong Kong continues to adopt the common law system and enjoys independent judicial power and final adjudication power under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". The common law system helps safeguard the development of the rule of law, economy and other areas in the HKSAR. It also underlines the uniqueness of the “one country, two systems” principle.",
            "“Article 95 of the Basic Law stipulates that the HKSAR ‘may, through consultations and in accordance with law, maintain juridical relations with the judicial organs of other parts of the country, and they may render assistance to each other’. This article provides a solid constitutional basis for mutual legal assistance between the two jurisdictions,” he said.",
            "When reviewing the developments of mutual legal assistance, Mr Yuen pointed out that the two jurisdictions had during the earlier stage achieved three arrangements on civil and commercial matters, namely, on the mutual service of judicial documents, mutual enforcement of arbitral awards and mutual enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters by the courts of both sides pursuant to choice of court agreements between parties concerned.",
            "\"The three arrangements are working well and play a significant role, especially the arrangement on mutual enforcement of arbitral awards. Not only does it enhance exchanges between the arbitration and legal sectors of the two jurisdictions, the arrangement also helps the HKSAR consolidate its status as an international legal and dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region,\" he said.",
            "Mr Yuen pointed out that in order to further advance the implementation of the \"one country, two systems\" principle, mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters should be strengthened.",
            "He said that the Supreme People's Court signed minutes with the DoJ in March last year, in which both sides agreed to actively pursue the work on three aspects, namely the arrangement on mutual taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters, an arrangement on reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments on matrimonial and related matters, and an arrangement on reciprocal enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters involving situations other than the presence of choice of court agreements. The first arrangement was signed at the end of last year and became effective on March 1 this year. The DoJ will continue to take forward the second and third arrangements.",
            "During his visit to Xian, Mr Yuen met with the Executive Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Mr Shen Deyong, the Vice Chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference of Shaanxi Province, Mr Zhu Lieke and the Vice Governor of Shaanxi Province, Mr Du Hangwei to exchange views on issues of mutual interest.",
            "Mr Yuen will visit court facilities tomorrow (April 24) and return to Hong Kong in the afternoon.",

            "研討會以「內地與香港特區民商事司法協助二十周年回顧與展望」為題，集合兩地司法、法律和仲裁界的專家回顧內地和香港特區的民商事司法協助發展，並就未來的推進工作進行交流。",
            "袁國強表示，在「一國兩制」的基本方針政策之下，香港繼續採用普通法制度，並享有獨立的司法權和終審權。普通法制度有助維護特區的法治和經濟等不同領域的發展，也凸顯「一國兩制」的獨特之處。",
            "他說：「《基本法》第95條訂明，特區『可與全國其他地區的司法機關通過協商依法進行司法方面的聯繫和相互提供協助』，這條文為兩地的司法協助工作提供穩固的憲制基礎。」",
            "他回顧兩地司法協助工作發展時指出，兩地在較早階段就民商事方面達成三項安排，分別是關於相互委託送達司法文書、相互執行仲裁裁決和相互執行當事人協議的民商事判決。",
            "他說：「這三項安排運作良好，發揮重大的作用，特別是相互執行仲裁裁決的安排，不但有助兩地的仲裁界和法律界的交流，更有助香港鞏固其作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決中心的地位。」",
            "袁國強指出，為進一步優化「一國兩制」的全面落實，必須加強兩地的民商事司法協助。",
            "他說，最高人民法院與律政司去年三月簽訂會議紀要，雙方同意積極推進三方面的工作，即民商事案件相互委託取證的安排；相互執行婚姻家事判決的安排；以及相互執行非當事人協議管轄的民商事案件判決的框架安排。上述第一項涉及取證的安排已在去年年底簽訂，並在本年三月一日生效。律政司將繼續推展第二及第三項安排的工作。",
            "訪問西安期間，袁國強與最高人民法院常務副院長沈德咏、陝西省政協副主席祝列克及陝西省副省長杜航偉會面，就雙方關注的議題交流意見。",
