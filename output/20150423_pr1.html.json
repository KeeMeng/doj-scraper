            "Following is the transcript of remarks made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, after attending a radio programme today (April 23):",
            "Reporter: Can you elaborate a bit about what you said in the programme, that you think the pan-democrats do not have an objective reason for opposing the reform package?",
            "Secretary for Justice: As I was saying in the radio programme just now, we have put forward all the explanations as to each and every bit of the proposal that we put forward. So far, what we have heard from the pan-democrats is that they would object to any proposal which is made on the basis of the decision made by the NPCSC on August 31 last year. Basically, what they are saying is, if you are doing it in accordance with the law, in accordance with the decision made by the NPCSC last August, we are going to object to that. That is, if I may say, it's no more than a political slogan. We have not heard any detailed analysis as to the reasons behind. And in fact, more importantly, one thing which they have yet to explain to the community of Hong Kong is that, if they were to reject this proposal put forward by the Government, first of all, what are the chances of getting yet another proposal which they think is acceptable and which they think also will be found acceptable by the other sectors of the community in Hong Kong, and also the Central People's Government. So in other words, what they have not explained to the people of Hong Kong is if they reject the proposal now, when are we going to have universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief Executive? How they are going to achieve that and why do they think they can do that? It's not they who are the only sector in the Hong Kong community that we need to take into account.",
            "Reporter: But there are not much changes to the nominating procedure from the existing proceedings and the proposed proceedings. Essentially the nomination threshold is even higher than what it was for the candidate to become an unofficial candidate. The entry threshold is of course lower but the nominating process is not much different.",
            "Secretary for Justice: I am not too sure I can agree with that. A few points we need to take into account. First of all, our proposal would have to be on the basis of the Decision made by the NPCSC last August. That is something which is more than crystal clear. Secondly, when we want to consider how we should do with the composition of the nominating committee, one needs to consider not just the legal consideration. We also have to take into account the political consideration, if not political reality. As a matter of fact, the political reality is I don't think there can be any consensus which can be reached in relation to the composition of the nominating committee. I gave the example in the programme just now, that people have been suggesting perhaps we can pick up one of those sub-sectors and cut down the number of seats. But the question is would they agree? And we were to do that, would they in fact end up that the whole package would be vetoed by the relevant Legislative Council members which leads to the result that we can't even step forward in the progress of universal suffrage? So we need to take into account the overall picture and whether or not if we were to adjust one aspect and the result would be wholly adverse leading to the veto of the whole package. Therefore, we need to take into account not just one factor; we need to look at the overall picture.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（四月二十三日）出席電台節目後與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者︰昨日落區時遇到較混亂的情況，會否擔心落區其實無法與市民溝通，令你們原來想做的工作做不到？",
            "律政司司長︰我們落區當然希望與市民溝通，希望向市民解釋政府現時的建議，亦希望藉此機會向大家作呼籲，無論大家對政改的建議或政改的事情有甚麼意見也好，表達意見時，應該合法、依法，以及不要破壞秩序，任何人在行使他的言論自由時，也應該有這考慮。而且我們經常說民主，我們亦要尊重不同意見人士發表他們的言論或意見的權利，所以不希望我們往後再落區時，出現混亂的情況，更不希望出現混亂情況時，任何人有不必要的受傷。其實昨日亦有些同事的腳被踐踏了很多次或被撞到，這對大家也不好，甚至很可能反對政改人士本身的人身安全也應該顧及，所以希望大家在政府往後落區時，也給予我們空間，大家可以比較理性和平靜討論政改問題。",
            "記者：你昨日是否覺得自己倉皇離開？是否政府低估了落區的難度和被狙擊的機會？",
            "律政司司長：我覺得不是倉皇離開，反而我覺得辛苦了在場維持秩序的糾察，亦辛苦了警方前線同事，因為他們真的很努力希望仍然在混亂情況下維持秩序，亦不希望有人受傷，所以在此多謝前線同事、前線警方同事的努力，亦多謝當時在現場幫忙維持秩序的糾察。你的問題很好，亦希望藉這問題帶出，重申剛才所說，即使反對政府建議的朋友，也不應該用任何破壞秩序的手法，令他人有可能人身安全受影響。",
            "記者：會否覺得違背了你們落區的原意？原來想聽市民聲音，但昨日根本一個市民的聲音都聽不到。",
            "律政司司長：是否違背見仁見智，但我們仍然做到宣傳工作。若你說令我們的效用減低的話，這不是政府所造成的，而是那些令秩序受破壞的人士造成，這亦是為何我剛才在此呼籲，他們要主張他們的言論自由之餘，他們亦應該同時尊重他人的集會自由、他人的言論自由。不可以因為他有很強烈的看法，便不准其他人發表他們的意見。所以希望他們往後真的就這些事情三思。",
            "記者：可否解釋為何指泛民的反對沒有客觀理據？",
            "律政司司長：其實我剛才都說了，到今日為止，似乎他們的說法也是說人大「8.31」決定基礎上的建議，他們也會反對，但我們已多次解釋「8.31」這決定是考慮了香港現時的政治現實環境，也考慮了整體，無論是法律上，或其他方面的因素，包括各個界別的利益、各個界別的考慮下作出的決定。而且中央亦說得很清楚，人大「8.31」決定是不可撼動。在這情況下，我們要考慮的，不單是法律空間，也要考慮香港現在面對的環境，也要考慮政治現實，所以我們在做政改工作時，我們不能只單一考慮某一界別，或某一些政治意見的團體或政黨的看法或理念，我們要的是兼顧香港不同界別、不同政治意見的人士。所以在這情況下，若我們否決，泛民議員到今天為止也沒有告訴我們，他們有甚麼把握在否決後，如何令香港往後可以有普選。換言之，簡單來說，若今次否決二○一七年我們提出的建議，何時可以達到一個全香港可以認為是合適的、他們又認為可接受的普選方案呢？完全沒有很實質的解釋，他們可以怎樣做，他們可以做到甚麼，令香港特區政府、香港市民、中央會同意他們的看法。若然沒有，如我們今次否決，往後如何呢？是否真的令二○一七年後更難或有普選的機會更低呢？這不單是我們現在要考慮的，亦正如我剛才在電台節目所說，我們今次若不通過普選方案，下一代人問我們，為何當時不通過？為何當時不令下一代可以出來投票呢？這我們亦要向我們的下一代負責。謝謝。",
