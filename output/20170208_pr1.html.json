            "Following is the translation of the speech made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in moving the second reading of the Apology Bill at the Legislative Council meeting today (February 8):",
            "President,",
            "I move that the Apology Bill (Bill) be read the second time. The objective of the Bill is to facilitate the resolution of disputes by promoting and encouraging the making of apologies by parties in disputes when they want to do so by stating the legal consequences of making an apology.",
            "The Bill was formulated on the basis of the recommendations made by the Steering Committee on Mediation (Steering Committee) after two rounds of public consultation held in 2015 and 2016.",
            "In a dispute following a mishap, a party may wish to convey condolences or sympathy to the other party for the loss and suffering sustained or to make an apology. However, at the moment, people are often inhibited from making an apology, and their legal advisers may also advise them not to make an apology,even if they wish to do so. This is because, under the current law of Hong Kong, an apology may be relied on by a plaintiff in civil proceedings as evidence of admission of fault or liability on the part of the defendant (i.e. the party making the apology). Further, there is a common concern against the making of an apology for fear that one's insurance company may seek to repudiate liability under an insurance policy by relying on clauses in the insurance contract that prohibit the admission of fault by an insured. Such a general reluctance to apologise is certainly not conducive to the prevention of escalation of disputes or their resolution.",
            "Apology legislation is not something new among common law jurisdictions. The first apology legislation was enacted in Massachusetts of the United States of America in 1986. At present, over 30 American states have apology legislation. Subsequently, apology legislation was also respectively enacted in Australia, Canada and Scotland.",
            "The Steering Committee conducted two rounds of public consultation on the proposal to enact apology legislation in Hong Kong in June 2015 and February 2016. In the first round public consultation, the Steering Committee sought the public's views on the proposal of enactment of apology legislation, its scope of application and form, etc. In the second round public consultation, the Steering Committee sought the public's views on mainly three aspects: first, whether certain proceedings such as disciplinary or regulatory proceedings should be excluded from the application of the proposed apology legislation; second, whether factual information conveyed in an apology should likewise be protected by the proposed apology legislation; and third, the draft Bill.",
            "Having taken into account the responses received in the second round public consultation and other relevant considerations, the Steering Committee published its final report in November 2016, recommending that the proposed apology legislation should apply to all disciplinary and regulatory proceedings except proceedings conducted under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance (Cap 86), the Coroners Ordinance (Cap 504) and the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap 390). Further, a schedule of excepted proceedings, with a mechanism to allow future amendments to be made to it, should be provided for in the draft Bill to provide flexibility.",
            "The Steering Committee also recommends that statements of fact conveyed in apologies should likewise be protected, but the decision makers (for example, a court, a tribunal or an arbitrator, etc) in applicable proceedings should retain discretion in this matter.",
            "The Government agrees to all the recommendations of the Steering Committee and considers that there is a need for legislation in Hong Kong defining the meaning of \"apology\" and providing for the legal consequences for making an apology, the effect of apologies on limitation of actions and insurance contracts, and the scope of proceedings to which the legislation is to apply.",
            "The Bill provides for the effect of apologies in certain non-criminal proceedings and legal matters. Similar to the apology legislation enacted in other jurisdictions, the Bill is relatively short. The Bill contains 13 clauses and a Schedule. Under the Bill, an apology made by or on behalf of a person means an expression of the person's regret, sympathy or benevolence. If part of the expression is an admission of the person's fault or liability, or a statement of fact, the admission or statement is also included in the meaning of \"apology\". The Bill protects an apology by precluding it from constituting an admission of fault or liability, and from being taken into account in determining fault, liability or any other issue to the prejudice of the apology maker, for the purposes of applicable proceedings.",
            "Moreover, the Bill makes evidence of an apology generally not admissible for determining fault, liability or any other issue to the prejudice of the apology maker in applicable proceedings. Nevertheless, a statement of fact contained in an apology is admissible as evidence in particular applicable proceedings at the decision maker's discretion, which may be exercised in an exceptional case and only if it is just and equitable to do so, having regard to all the relevant circumstances.",
            "In the Bill, the expression \"applicable proceedings\" refer to judicial, arbitral, administrative, disciplinary and regulatory proceedings, and other proceedings conducted under an enactment. However, they do not include criminal proceedings, or some specific types of excepted proceedings listed in the Schedule, which can be amended by the Chief Executive in Council.",
            "The Bill also precludes an apology from constituting an acknowledgment of a right of action, and so also from extending the relevant limitation period for the purposes of the Limitation Ordinance (Cap 347). Moreover, the Bill provides that an apology does not affect any insurance cover, compensation or other form of benefit under a contract of insurance or indemnity.",
            "To maximise the benefits of the Bill, the Bill applies to the Government.",
            "The Department of Justice, together with the Steering Committee, provided a briefing to the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services in November last year. The Panel on the whole supported the proposed apology legislation.",
            "President, the objective of the Bill is consistent with the Government's policy to encourage the wider use of mediation to resolve disputes. The introduction of new legislation is the only option that can provide legal certainty on the implications of making an apology by a party to a dispute in Hong Kong. Further, Hong Kong will become the first jurisdiction in Asia to enact apology legislation, and this will help to further enhance Hong Kong's position as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region.",
            "With these remarks, I urge Members to support the Bill.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（二月八日）在立法會會議上動議二讀《道歉條例草案》的致辭全文：",
            "主席：",
            "我謹動議二讀《道歉條例草案》（《條例草案》）。《條例草案》旨在訂明作出道歉的法律後果，從而提倡和鼓勵爭議各方按意願作出道歉，以期促進排解爭端。",
            "《條例草案》是根據調解督導委員會（督導委員會）在二○一五年及二○一六年作出兩輪公眾諮詢後提出的建議所制定。",
            "因發生不幸事故而出現爭端時，爭端一方可能希望就受傷害一方所蒙受的損失及痛苦，向其表達慰問、同情或作出道歉。但現時公眾普遍怯於道歉，其律師亦可能不建議作出道歉，理由是在香港的現行法律下，原告人有可能在民事程序中，援引答辯人（即道歉一方）曾作出的道歉，作為其承認過失或法律責任的證據。此外，他們可能擔心保險公司會基於保險合約禁止受保人承認過失的條款，拒絕履行保險單訂明的責任。這種普遍不願道歉的情況，確實無助防止爭端惡化或達成和解。",
            "道歉法例在普通法司法管轄區中並非新生事物。首項道歉法例在一九八六年於美國馬薩諸塞州制定，至今逾30個美國州份已制定道歉法例。其後，澳洲、加拿大及蘇格蘭亦分別制定各自的道歉法例。",
            "督導委員會在二○一五年六月及二○一六年二月就在香港制定道歉法例的建議進行了兩輪公眾諮詢。在第一輪公眾諮詢中，督導委員會就制定道歉法例的建議、法例的適用範圍以及形式等問題諮詢公眾意見。在第二輪公眾諮詢中，督導委員會主要就三方面諮詢公眾: 第一、紀律處分及規管法律等若干程序應否豁免於《條例草案》；第二、擬議道歉法例應否同樣保護道歉時傳達的事實陳述；以及第三、《條例草案》擬稿。",
            "督導委員會考慮了在第二輪公眾諮詢所得的回應及其他相關因素後，在二○一六年十一月發表最終報告，建議擬議道歉法例應適用於所有紀律處分程序及規管法律程序，但根據香港法例第86章《調查委員會條例》、香港法例第504章《死因裁判官條例》及香港法例第390章《淫褻及不雅物品管制條例》進行的程序則屬例外。此外，為提供靈活性，應在《條例草案》擬稿設立例外程序附表，以及日後修訂附表的機制。",
            "督導委員會亦建議，道歉傳達的事實陳述應被視為道歉的一部分，並受到道歉法例所保護，但在適用程序中裁斷者（例如法院、審裁處或仲裁員等）應保留酌情權。",
            "政府同意督導委員會提出的所有建議，並認為有需要在香港制定法例，以界定「道歉」的定義，和訂明道歉的法律後果、道歉對訴訟時效和保險合約的影響，以及該法例適用的程序範圍。",
            "《條例草案》就道歉在某些非刑事程序及法律事宜中的效果，作出規定。《條例草案》相對簡短，包含13項條文及一個附表。 根據《條例草案》，某人或代表該人作出的道歉，指該人表達的歉意、懊悔、遺憾、同情或善意。如該表達的部分內容是承認該人的過失或法律責任，或是事實陳述，則該承認或事實陳述亦包含在「道歉」的涵義之內。《條例草案》保護道歉，規定就適用程序而言，某人的道歉，並不構成承認該人的過失或法律責任，而在裁斷過失、法律責任或任何其他爭議事項時，亦不得將該道歉列為不利於該人的考慮因素。",
            "同時，《條例草案》使某人的道歉及其所附隨的事實陳述，在一般情況下不得在適用程序中，為裁斷過失、法律責任或任何其他爭議事項，被接納為不利於該人的證據。然而，如在個別適用程序中，出現特殊情況，有關的裁斷者具有酌情權，可在該程序中，接納道歉所包含的事實陳述為證據，但該裁斷者須信納，行使該酌情權，在顧及一切有關情況下，屬公正公平之舉，方可行使該酌情權。",
            "在《條例草案》中「適用程序」一詞指司法、仲裁、行政、紀律處分及規管性程序，以及根據成文法則進行的其他程序。然而，適用程序並不包括刑事法律程序或附表列出的若干特定類別的例外程序。該附表可由行政長官會同行政會議修訂。",
            "《條例草案》亦使道歉不會構成香港法例第347章《時效條例》所指的訴訟權的承認，從而使有關的時效期不得藉此延長。此外，《條例草案》規定道歉不影響保險或彌償合約對任何人提供的保險保障、補償或其他形式的利益。",
            "為達到《條例草案》的最大效益，《條例草案》適用於政府。",
            "律政司聯同督導委員會在去年十一月就《條例草案》諮詢了立法會司法及法律事務委員會，事務委員會整體上支持擬議道歉法例。",
            "主席，《條例草案》的目的與政府鼓勵更廣泛使用調解以排解爭端的政策一致。只有制定新法例，才可就在香港爭端一方道歉的後果，提供明確的法律依據。此外，香港會成為亞洲首個制定道歉法例的司法管轄區，將有助進一步提升香港作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。",
            "我謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持《條例草案》。",
            "多謝主席。",
