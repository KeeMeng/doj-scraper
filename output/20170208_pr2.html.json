            "Following is a question by the Hon Junius Ho and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council meeting today (February 8):",
            "Question:",
            "In reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on March 2 last year, the Government advised that during the \"Occupation Movement\" in 2014, a total of 1 003 persons were arrested by the Police for various alleged offences. As at January 31 last year, 216 persons (accounting for about 22 per cent of the arrested persons) had to face judicial proceedings; 182 persons had their judicial proceedings completed, and amongst them, 116 persons (accounting for about 12 per cent of the arrested persons) had to bear legal consequences. Of these 116 persons, 74 were convicted (accounting for about 34 per cent of the persons who had to face judicial proceedings) and another 42 were bound over. There have been public comments that the prosecution work carried out by the Department of Justice (DoJ) has been progressing slowly, and the relevant prosecution and conviction rates are also rather low. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether DoJ has encountered any difficulties in carrying out the aforesaid prosecution work; if DoJ has, of the details; of the measures which may expedite DoJ's prosecution work; whether DoJ has formulated a timetable for completing those remaining cases in respect of which prosecutions have not been instituted; if DoJ has, of the details;",
            "(2) of the latest prosecution and conviction rates pertaining to the aforesaid arrested persons; the latest number of convicted persons, with a breakdown by the category of the penalties imposed on them (including imprisonment and community service orders) and by the gravity of such penalties; and",
            "(3) of the progress of the prosecution work against the three initiators and other instigators of the Occupation Movement?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The \"Occupy Movement\" is an important incident in the history of Hong Kong. The Department of Justice (DoJ) fully understands the concern of the Hong Kong community as to how the criminal liability of those who had been suspected of unlawful conduct during the \"Occupy Movement\" should be dealt with. As a matter of fact, DoJ and the Police have all along been actively following up the cases, with a view to dealing with the relevant matters appropriately.",
            "Before responding to the three specific questions raised, it is necessary to clarify certain basic concepts. I notice that at the beginning of his question, the Hon Junius Ho set out and made comparison of the number of persons who were arrested, prosecuted, convicted or bound over. I am afraid that such comparisons provide no reference value or may even lead to misunderstanding. This is because, under the legal system of Hong Kong, different standards are adopted when the Police effect arrests, when DoJ decides on whether prosecution should be commenced, and when the Court decides on the criminal responsibilities of the defendants:",
            "(1) According to section 50 of the Police Force Ordinance (Cap. 232), police officers are entitled to effect arrest of the person concerned if they have reasonable suspicion;",
            "(2) DoJ makes prosecution decisions in accordance with the principles set out in the Prosecution Code. Unless there is sufficient admissible evidence so that the case has a reasonable prospect of conviction, and that it is in the public interest to prosecute, no prosecution should be commenced.",
            "(3) Judges, on the other hand, will only convict if the offence is proved beyond reasonable doubt.",
            "Due to such differences in the standards adopted, the mere fact that an arrested person is not charged does not necessarily mean that the Police have made a wrongful arrest; nor does it necessarily follow that the prosecutors have failed in their duty by not prosecuting. Similarly, since a higher standard is adopted by the court when deciding whether to convict as compared to the standard adopted in commencing prosecution, and that there may often be developments which prosecutors could not possibly foresee or control during the trial process, the mere fact that some of the defendants were acquitted does not necessarily mean that there was any error in respect of the decision of effecting arrest or commencing prosecution.",
            "In respect of parts (1) and (3) of the Hon Junius Ho's question, the consolidated response of DoJ is as follows:",
            "The questions of criminal liability arising from the \"Occupy Movement\" have indeed brought about considerable challenges. Apart from the prosecution work that would otherwise have to be dealt with, the Prosecutions Division of DoJ also has to handle at the same time the substantial number of cases involving possible criminal conduct that had taken place during the \"Occupy Movement\".",
            "From around December 2014, colleagues of the Prosecutions Division started to communicate or have working meetings with the Police to provide legal advice so as to assist the Police in their work of investigation and evidence gathering, etc. During this period, DoJ decided in appropriate circumstances how to deal with the specific cases of which investigation had been completed, including commencing judicial process against 216 persons.",
            "Furthermore, up to August last year, the Police submitted in respect of 287 other arrested persons a total of about 335 investigation reports, 300 witness statements, 130 hours of video recordings and about 80 items of non-video exhibits. After detailed consideration of the materials provided by the Police and the relevant legal issues, DoJ had provided further detailed written legal advice to the Police at the end of last year in respect of those aforesaid 287 arrestees, including cases involving those who were suspected to have performed a leading role. As DoJ understands, the Police are following up on the legal advice given by DoJ. As the relevant criminal procedures are still on-going, it is not appropriate for us to make further specific comments at this stage.",
            "As the number of arrested persons is large and the volume of evidence involved is substantial, colleagues of the Prosecutions Division have to spend substantial time to study and examine the relevant materials and possible legal or technical issues. For instance, colleagues concerned have to take a long time to go through the video evidence, consider admissibility and other questions relevant under the law of evidence, analyse the specific circumstances of each and every incident, and provide legal advice on the appropriate manner to handle each relevant person. Moreover, unless the relevant incidents could be handled on their own, the numerous incidents involved in the \"Occupy Movement\" are often inter-connected, rendering it impossible to handle individual arrestees separately. Quite the contrary, it is necessary for DoJ to consider the cases of numerous arrestees in a comprehensive and holistic manner.",
            "In order to achieve better efficiency in the handling of cases related to the \"Occupy Movement\" and with a view to ensuring consistency of approach, on the basis of an existing dedicated team of prosecutors responsible for handling public order event cases, DoJ set up a dedicated team in early 2015 to handle cases related to the \"Occupy Movement\", with members from different relevant units led by the prosecutors of the original group handling public order event cases.",
            "In respect of part (2) of the question, the response of DoJ is as follows:",
            "During the \"Occupy Movement\" in 2014, a total of 955 persons were arrested by the Police for various alleged offences, and another 48 persons were arrested by the Police after the incident. As at January 31, 2017, a total of 216 arrestees have undergone or are undergoing judicial proceedings. Amongst them, 123 persons have to bear legal consequences (i.e. 81 who were convicted and 42 who were bound over).",
            "The convictions include unlawful assembly, arson, possession of offensive weapon, criminal damage, wounding, assaulting police officer, common assault, possession of imitation firearms, theft, criminal intimidation, indecent assault, possession of dangerous drugs, and possession of Part I poisons, etc. The penalties of convicted persons include imprisonment from two days to 10 months, probation order of 12 to 15 months, community service order of 80 to 180 hours, treatment in drug treatment centres, and fine of $300 to $6,000.",
            "President, DoJ will continue to follow up on the issue of criminal liability in respect of the \"Occupy Movement\", and will also uphold its constitutional responsibility in handling the prosecution work concerned in an impartial, professional and apolitical manner.",
            "Thank you.",

            "以下是今日（二月八日）在立法會會議上何君堯議員的提問和律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "政府於去年三月二日回覆本會議員的質詢時表示，警方在二○一四年「佔領運動」期間，共拘捕了1 003名涉嫌干犯各種罪行的人士。截至去年一月三十一日，有216人須面對司法程序，佔被捕人數約百分之二十二；有182人的司法程序已完成，而其中有116人須承擔法律後果，佔被捕人數約百分之十二。在這116人當中，74人被定罪，佔須面對司法程序人數約百分之三十四，另有42人簽保守行為。有輿論認為，律政司的檢控工作進展緩慢，而相關的檢控率和定罪率亦頗低。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）律政司在進行上述檢控工作時有否遇到困難；如有，詳情為何；有何措施可加快檢控工作；有否就完成處理餘下未提出檢控的個案制訂時間表；如有，詳情為何；",
            "（二）與上述被捕人士相關的最新檢控率和定罪率為何；被定罪人士的最新數目，並按他們被判刑罰的類別（包括監禁及社會服務令）及按刑罰的輕重列出分項數目；及",
            "（三）針對佔領運動三位發起人及其他鼓動者的檢控工作進展為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "「佔領行動」是香港歷史上的重要事件。律政司完全明白香港社會關注如何處理「佔領行動」期間涉嫌違法人士的刑責問題。事實上，律政司與警方一直積極跟進，務求恰當地處理相關事宜。",
            "在回答三項的具體問題前，有必要先釐清若干基本概念。我留意到何議員在問題首部分，列舉及比較被拘捕的人數、被檢控的人數、以及被定罪和簽保守行為的人數。我恐怕這類比較不具參考價值，甚或可能引起誤會。原因是，在香港的法律制度下，警務人員進行拘捕、律政司決定應否檢控、以及法院決定被告人士的刑責時採用不一樣的標準︰",
            "（一）根據香港法例第232章《警隊條例》第50條，只要有合理懷疑，警務人員便有權對相關人士進行拘捕。",
            "（二）律政司在決定應否提出檢控時，則必須依據《檢控守則》的指引。除非有充分可被法院接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪，並且符合公眾利益，否則不應展開檢控。",
            "（三）法官則只會在毫無合理疑點的情況下才會裁定被告罪成。",
            "由於適用的標準有異，被捕人士不被檢控並不必然代表警方錯誤進行拘捕，亦不意味檢控人員失職，應檢控而不檢控。同樣地，由於法院定罪的門檻比提控的標準為高，而且在審訊過程中往往會出現檢控人員不可能預知或控制的變數，因此即使部分被告最終被裁定無罪，亦不代表拘捕或檢控決定有錯。",
            "就何議員第（一）項及第（三）項提問，律政司綜合回答如下︰",
            "「佔領行動」衍生的刑責問題，確實帶來相當的挑戰。除原有的檢控工作，律政司刑事檢控科須同時處理在「佔領行動」期間發生的眾多可能涉及刑事罪行的案件。",
            "自大約二○一四年十二月起，刑事檢控科的同事已開始與警方進行溝通或舉行工作會議，向警方提供法律意見，協助警方的調查及搜證等工作。其間就個別完成調查的事件，律政司在合適情況下決定如何處理，包括就216人展開司法程序。",
            "此外，直至去年八月，警方向律政司就另外287名被捕人士合共提供大約335份調查報告、300份證人口供、130小時錄像影片、以及大約80份非錄像證物。在詳細考慮警方提供的資料及研究相關法律問題後，律政司於去年年底向警方就上述287名被捕人士提供詳細書面法律意見，當中包括可能涉及扮演主導角色人士的個案。據律政司了解，警方現正就律政司的法律意見作出跟進。由於有關的刑事程序仍在進行中，現階段律政司不適宜在這方面作更具體評論。",
            "由於被拘捕人士數目眾多，涉及的證據繁多，刑事檢控科的同事須花大量時間去研究和審視相關資料及有可能出現的法律或技術問題，例如負責同事需要用相當長時間審視錄像證據、考慮其「可接納性」等證據法上的問題、分析每件事件的個別情況，以及就每名相關人士的適當處理方法提供法律指引。此外，除非相關事件可先行獨立處理，「佔領行動」涉及的眾多事件往往環環相扣，不可將個別被捕人士作「斬件式」獨立處理。反之，律政司有必要就眾多名被捕人士作整體通盤考慮。",
            "為了更有效地處理「佔領行動」的案件及確保一致性，刑事檢控科在原有負責「公眾秩序活動」案件的小隊的基礎上，於二○一五年年初成立一個專責處理「佔領行動」案件的小組，成員包括不同相關組別的成員，由原本專責處理「公眾秩序活動」的檢控人員帶領。",
            "就第（二）項提問，律政司的回答如下︰",
            "在二○一四年「佔領行動」期間，共有955人因涉嫌干犯不同罪行而被警方拘捕，另外有48人於事件結束後被警方拘捕。截至二○一七年一月三十一日，共有216人已經或正在經司法程序處理，其中有123人須承擔法律後果（即81人被定罪及42人須簽保守行為）。",
            "被定罪人士的罪名包括非法集結、縱火、藏有攻擊性武器、刑事毀壞、傷人、襲擊警務人員、普通襲擊、管有仿製槍械、盜竊、刑事恐嚇、非禮、管有危險藥物及管有第I部毒藥等。被定罪人士的判罰包括監禁2日至10個月、感化令12至15個月、社會服務令80至180小時、戒毒所治療及罰款300至6,000元不等。",
            "主席，律政司會繼續跟進「佔領行動」的刑責問題，亦會恪守其憲制責任，以中立、專業和非政治化的態度處理相關檢控工作。",
            "多謝主席。",

            "除原有的檢控工作，律政司刑事檢控科須同時處理在「佔領行動」期間發生的眾多可能涉及刑事罪行的案件",
            "自大約二○一四年十二月起，刑事檢控科的同事已開始與警方進行溝通或舉行工作會議，向警方提供法律意見，協助警方的調查及搜證等工作",
            "其間就個別完成調查的事件，律政司在合適情況下決定如何處理，包括就216人展開司法程序",
            "此外，直至去年八月，警方向律政司就另外287名被捕人士合共提供大約335份調查報告、300份證人口供、130小時錄像影片、以及大約80份非錄像證物",
            "在詳細考慮警方提供的資料及研究相關法律問題後，律政司於去年年底向警方就上述287名被捕人士提供詳細書面法律意見，當中包括可能涉及扮演主導角色人士的個案",
            "據律政司了解，警方現正就律政司的法律意見作出跟進",
            "由於有關的刑事程序仍在進行中，現階段律政司不適宜在這方面作更具體評論",
            "由於被拘捕人士數目眾多，涉及的證據繁多，刑事檢控科的同事須花大量時間去研究和審視相關資料及有可能出現的法律或技術問題，例如負責同事需要用相當長時間審視錄像證據、考慮其「可接納性」等證據法上的問題、分析每件事件的個別情況，以及就每名相關人士的適當處理方法提供法律指引",
            "此外，除非相關事件可先行獨立處理，「佔領行動」涉及的眾多事件往往環環相扣，不可將個別被捕人士作「斬件式」獨立處理",
            "反之，律政司有必要就眾多名被捕人士作整體通盤考慮",
            "為了更有效地處理「佔領行動」的案件及確保一致性，刑事檢控科在原有負責「公眾秩序活動」案件的小隊的基礎上，於二○一五年年初成立一個專責處理「佔領行動」案件的小組，成員包括不同相關組別的成員，由原本專責處理「公眾秩序活動」的檢控人員帶領",
            "就第（二）項提問，律政司的回答如下︰",
            "在二○一四年「佔領行動」期間，共有955人因涉嫌干犯不同罪行而被警方拘捕，另外有48人於事件結束後被警方拘捕",
            "截至二○一七年一月三十一日，共有216人已經或正在經司法程序處理，其中有123人須承擔法律後果（即81人被定罪及42人須簽保守行為）",
            "被定罪人士的罪名包括非法集結、縱火、藏有攻擊性武器、刑事毀壞、傷人、襲擊警務人員、普通襲擊、管有仿製槍械、盜竊、刑事恐嚇、非禮、管有危險藥物及管有第I部毒藥等",
            "被定罪人士的判罰包括監禁2日至10個月、感化令12至15個月、社會服務令80至180小時、戒毒所治療及罰款300至6,000元不等",
            "主席，律政司會繼續跟進「佔領行動」的刑責問題，亦會恪守其憲制責任，以中立、專業和非政治化的態度處理相關檢控工作",
            "多謝主席",
            "2017年02月08日（星期三）"
