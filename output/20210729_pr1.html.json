            "The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, continued her visit in Beijing today (July 29) by meeting with officials from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (Basic Law Committee), the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice.",
            "In the morning, Ms Cheng called on the Chairman of the Basic Law Committee, Mr Shen Chunyao, and pointed out that Hong Kong has reverted to a safe, rational and inclusive society after the implementation of the National Security Law (NSL), and the principle of \"patriots administering Hong Kong\" is upheld by improving the electoral system. At the meeting, she remarked that the Basic Law 30th Anniversary Legal Summit organised by the Department of Justice (DoJ) last year enabled the public to go \"Back to Basics\" in order to establish a better understanding of the Basic Law. The second legal summit on the Basic Law will be held next year. She also pointed out that the DoJ has been carrying out promotion through different activities to give young people, in particular students, a proper understanding of the basic concepts of the Constitution, the Basic Law and the NSL.",
            "Ms Cheng then met with the State Councillor and Minister of Public Security, Mr Zhao Kezhi, and the Assistant Minister of Public Security, Mr Chen Siyuan. Ms Cheng and the officials in her entourage introduced the works of the DoJ respectively, and were glad to know that the department's efforts have been well recognised. Ms Cheng then briefed them on the latest situation after the implementation of the NSL and agreed that it is crucial to uphold \"one country, two systems\", prevent acts endangering national security and implement the principle of \"patriots administering Hong Kong\" to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of \"one country, two systems\" as well as Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. She also talked about exploring the arrangements for facilitating persons participating in arbitral proceedings to travel to and from Hong Kong.",
            "In the afternoon, Ms Cheng visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to meet with the Vice Minister, Mr Ma Zhaoxu, and the Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law, Mr Jia Guide. She said that the DoJ will host the Annual Session of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO) at the end of this year. The event has been postponed last year due to the pandemic. AALCO will help further the Hong Kong legal community's understanding of international law, and further enhance Hong Kong's status as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre. At the meeting, Ms Cheng also talked about the latest situation of international institutions setting up offices in the Hong Kong Legal Hub, and expressed her gratitude to the MFA for its support and assistance for the secondment arrangements of legal professionals between Hong Kong and the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.",
            "Ms Cheng then called on the Ministry of Justice and signed a framework arrangement concerning legal talent exchanges and training co-operation with the Minister of Justice, Mr Tang Yijun. Under the arrangement, more two-way co-operation channels are to be developed. Ms Cheng also thanked the Ministry of Justice at the meeting for the policy on the implementation of the GBA Legal Professional Examination and related training, in particular the arrangement for setting up examination venues in Hong Kong. She stressed that the DoJ will complement the country's work on law-based governance and the promotion of rule of law involving foreign parties, and proactively integrate into national development.",

            "鄭若驊上午與香港基本法委員會主任沈春耀會面時，指出《香港國安法》落實後香港回復成為一個和平、理性和包容的社會，而完善選舉制度貫徹了「愛國者治港」的方針。她在會上提到律政司去年主辦了《基本法》頒布三十周年法律高峰論壇，讓社會各界可以追本溯源，並計劃明年再次舉辦《基本法》法律論壇。她又指律政司現正透過不同方式的活動向青少年，特別是學生，灌輸正確的《憲法》、《基本法》和《香港國安法》基本觀念。",
            "鄭若驊隨後與國務委員、公安部部長趙克志及副部長陳思源會晤，她與隨行人員分別介紹律政司的工作，並很高興得悉律政司的工作獲得肯定。鄭若驊之後向對方講解《香港國安法》落實後的最新情況，同意必須要維護「一國兩制」，防範任何危害國家主權安全的行為及落實「愛國者治港」原則，才能夠確保「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠，確保香港的長期繁榮穩定。鄭若驊在會上也提出了探討便利參與仲裁程序人士往來香港的安排。",
