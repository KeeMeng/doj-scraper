            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at a media session on the enforcement of injunction orders after attending the Legislative Council meeting today (November 26):",
            "Reporter: ... The protesters complained that the Police took over the action this morning 10 minutes after the bailiffs moved in.",
            "Secretary for Justice: I wasn't at the scene, so I cannot comment on exactly what the bailiffs did or did not do in the course of the explanation. But if there is any person who takes the view that the bailiffs are not performing their duty properly, I am sure they can take the matter at the appropriate venue. In relation to the second part of your question, I believe the Police would have to act according to the circumstances. As I was saying earlier in Cantonese, the court order, although it contained an authorisation granted to the Police, the court order at the same time made it clear that it is entirely without prejudice to the statutory power of the Police and also the power of the Police under the general law. In other words, in any given circumstances, the Police can, on the one hand, assist the bailiffs, at the bailiffs' request, to discharge their duties in enforcing the injunction. On the other hand, if and when the circumstances become or render it necessary, the Police can, if not duty-bound to, discharge their duties to actually exercise their statutory power to, for instance, maintain the peace as well as to prevent the occurrence of other criminal activities.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（十一月二十六日）在出席立法會會議後就法庭禁制令的執行與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者︰警方協助執達吏清理現場，有否超出範圍？問題是本身是在亞皆老街，但現已達新填地街，是否有問題？",
            "律政司司長：各位傳媒朋友，其實不存在超出或不超出禁制令範圍，因為禁制令的頒布來說，無論是原訟庭的區法官和上訴庭的兩位法官都說得很清楚，今次禁制令的相關條文，是不影響警方在法例下原本有的權力。換言之，警方一方面可以根據法庭的授權協助執達主任執行禁制令；另一方面，若情況有需要，警方同時可以行使他們香港法例以下所有的權力，而香港法例下所有的權力並無任何範圍，警方可以在全香港執行，亦有責任執行他們的職務，所以在有需要時，警方絕對可以採取他們認為應採取的執法行為。所以大家不要混淆，或被某些言論誤導，就是說警方一定或只可以根據禁制令的字眼或範圍辦事。法官說得很清楚，法庭的授權不影響警方的權力，所以沒有超越這個問題。",
            "記者：今早學聯成員指拆路障時，那些人是代理人，並不是執達吏，是否已經違反禁制令？",
            "律政司司長：我不知道那位學聯代表所說內容的詳細情況，但在執行禁制令時，原告人或原告人的代理人可以參與執行工作，我是指一般情況。這方面，只要相關人士是原告人正式授權的人士，他是可以參與執行禁制令的過程，所以要視乎當時學聯那位同學所指的人士是否得到原告人授權。謝謝。",
