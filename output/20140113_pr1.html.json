            "Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2014 today (January 13):",
            "Chief Justice, members of the Judiciary, Chairman of the Bar Association, President of the Law Society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,",
            "Once again, we gather here to usher in the new legal year. On behalf of the Department of Justice, may I extend our warmest welcome to all the guests attending this event, especially those who travelled from other jurisdictions.",
            "Ceremonial though it may appear, the Opening of the Legal Year is part of a long-established tradition adopted in many common law jurisdictions. In the context of Hong Kong, which is the only common law jurisdiction in the Greater China region, the Opening of the Legal Year has unique significance as it signifies the lively continuation of the common law tradition in Hong Kong under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle. Needless to say, it is also an appropriate occasion to reflect on the past and to look ahead.",
            "Judicial Independence",
            "Let me begin with the rule of law, which is well recognised as one of our core values. In any civilised society, the rule of law ensures that the government will not act in excess of its legal power. On the part of the Department of Justice, we would endeavour to do our utmost to maintain and uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong.",
            "Whilst it is of great importance for the Administration to do its part, it is equally crucial that other sectors of the community, and indeed the whole community, should respect the rule of law and refrain from conduct which would jeopardise the rule of law. In a cosmopolitan society like Hong Kong, it is perfectly natural that there would be very different opinions and demands. People would express their views and make their demands in many different ways. That is why it is important to have the freedom of expression and the other fundamental rights guaranteed under the Basic Law. However, a true respect for the rule of law means that not only the Government, but the community as a whole and every member of the community, should also respect the rule of law and exercise their rights within the boundary permitted by the law. Deliberate attempts to act in breach of the law, even for causes which may sound noble, should not be encouraged.",
            "One important aspect of the rule of law is judicial independence, which is firmly guaranteed under Article 85 of the Basic Law.",
            "Judges do not decide what cases would go before the courts. As and when cases are properly commenced pursuant to the relevant legal procedure and irrespective of whether they are controversial or otherwise, our judges have no choice but are obliged to adjudicate the cases according to the applicable law and the available evidence.",
            "Controversial decisions, such as cases concerning the rights guaranteed under the Basic Law or those concerning environmental protection, often attracted media attention or even generated heated discussion. This is totally understandable. The freedom of the press and the freedom of expression must allow appropriate and good faith discussion of decisions made by judges. As Lord Atkin once remarked (Note 1), \"Justice is not a cloistered virtue: she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and the respectful even though outspoken comments of ordinary men.\"",
            "However, appropriate discussion or even criticism of judicial decisions is one thing, abusive attacks and unwarranted conduct which would undermine the independence of the judiciary and public confidence in the administration of justice are totally different. As Sir Anthony Mason observed (Note 2) the courts \"should not be made a target of irresponsible criticism. Public confidence, which is vital to the well-being of the administration of justice, once lost or damaged, is not easily restored.\"",
            "Similarly, Sir Sydney Kentridge, QC, pointed out as follows (Note 3):",
            "\"... Independence here means more than independence from government direction. It means also that judges in making their decisions should as far as humanly possible not be influenced by public opinion, or by any sense of obligation to the government or to any individual, party, or pressure group. There is a particular threat to judicial independence which should concern us: that is, the growing tendency for politicians and the press to attack in intemperate and even vituperative terms judges who have given decisions with which they disagree.",
            "\"Judges, it has also been said, must have broad backs, and usually they have. The real mischief of unwarranted attacks on the motives and integrity of the judges, however, is not any hurt to the judge's feelings; it is that they undermine that respect for the judiciary without which, ... the foundations of the rule of law are undermined.\"",
            "Amidst the usually healthy discussion of judicial decisions and judges we had during the past year, one sign of concern is the emergence of abusive attacks. Some have even indicated that they would compile a list of judges whom they considered politically biased and would request their removal. However well-intended their subjective motives might be, such conduct should not be encouraged. As pointed out by the then Chief Justice Andrew Li in his speech delivered at the Opening of the Legal Year in January 2000, when the courts come under unwarranted attack, it is the constitutional responsibility of the Government to explain and defend the fundamental principle of judicial independence. The Department of Justice would have no hesitation to take such steps as may be necessary to defend judicial independence.",
            "Law Reform",
            "Apart from attracting discussion, controversial cases may provide momentum for law reform. The case of W v The Registrar of Marriages [2013] 3 HKLRD 90, where the Court of Final Appeal had to deal with the right to marry of transsexual persons, is a good example. Apart from introducing amendments to the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Note 4) so as to rectify the unconstitutional aspects of the current regime, an inter-departmental working group to be chaired by me is in the process of being set up to conduct a comprehensive review on our law concerning gender recognition. The key objective of this working group is to consider the introduction of appropriate legislation to protect the legal rights of transsexual persons.",
            "Law reform, as I mentioned on other occasions, plays an important role in maintaining the rule of law. We live in a fast-changing age. As our society evolves, our laws have to change so as to meet the changing needs of our society. To this end, the Law Reform Commission has taken on four new projects in the past year. They concern: (1) archives law; (2) access to information; (3) excepted offences under Schedule 3 to the Criminal Procedure Ordinance; and (4) third party funding for arbitration. With a view to enhancing interest in law reform, we recently launched the first Law Reform Essay Competition. Law students are invited to submit essays on a specified topic, namely, \"Should pre-nuptial agreements be recognised and enforceable in Hong Kong?\"",
            "Criminal Prosecution",
            "Another important aspect of our work is criminal prosecutions. To ensure that our prosecution policy is up to date, the Prosecutions Division has embarked on a comprehensive review of the previous Statement of Prosecution Policy and Practice, and released a new Prosecution Code, which took into account the latest developments of criminal jurisprudence and international trends. Further, in order to keep abreast of developments in other jurisdictions and to consider how our criminal justice system can be improved, various seminars and conferences were held during the past year. Examples include the 12th Heads of Prosecuting Agencies Conference and the seminar entitled \"The Debates: Criminal Justice Reform\".",
            "During the year, we have lost our most important member of the prosecutions team to the Judiciary, who is now the Honourable Mr Justice Zervos. That said, I am confident that our Prosecutions Division, under the leadership of our new Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, will continue to discharge its duties by providing a prosecution service which is independent, professional and fair.",
            "Centre for International Legal and Dispute Resolution Services",
            "Last year, I said Hong Kong is well placed to be a leading centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region. This remains the case, and the Department of Justice would continue with its efforts to enhance Hong Kong's strength in this regard. Indeed, during the past year, I and my colleagues have attended numerous events within and outside Hong Kong (including places like Beijing, Xiamen, the Hague, London, Macau and Seoul) to promote Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "As regards the plan for the future, may I highlight the following new initiatives.",
            "First, upon our invitation, the China Maritime Arbitration Commission has agreed to set up a branch organisation in Hong Kong. My colleagues are following up on the logistical details and we believe the branch would soon come to fruition. This move, we believe, would enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness in the field of international maritime arbitration.",
            "Second, as reflected by the figures released by the United Nations and other bodies, international investment arbitration is getting more and more popular. With its headquarters in the Hague, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) is a leading international institution with a long history and good reputation in this field. At our request, the Central People's Government and the PCA have commenced negotiation of a host country agreement on the conduct of dispute settlement proceedings in Hong Kong. The negotiation is making good progress, and I look forward to its finalisation in the near future so that more investment arbitrations would be conducted in Hong Kong.",
            "Third, as you may recall, the Government announced in December 2012 that it would allocate certain office space in the West Wing of the former Central Government Offices to legal and dispute resolution institutions (especially international or overseas institutions). As a follow up of this policy, I am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice will take over the former French Mission Building upon the relocation of the Court of Final Appeal to No. 8 Jackson Road, with a view to increasing the space that can be provided to legal and dispute resolution institutions. This will fit in well with the former Central Government Offices being used as the future home for the Department of Justice and law-related organisations, as well as enabling the whole area to become the future \"legal hub\" of Hong Kong.",
            "Fourth, with a view to enhancing better co-ordination and strategic planning for the development of international arbitration, a new advisory committee on the promotion of arbitration comprising representatives of the key stakeholders will soon be established. With this new committee, it is hoped that the development of arbitration would be taken to a new height.",
            "Constitutional Development",
            "One last area that I would like to cover is constitutional development. On December 4 last year, the Administration formally launched the Public Consultation on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016. As the Secretary for Justice, I am honoured to have the opportunity to take part in this important constitutional development. The Administration is firmly committed to forging consensus within the community on this important matter, and I urge members of the legal community to make positive contributions in this historical exercise.",
            "On this note, may I wish all of you and your families a happy and prosperous year of 2014. Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（一月十三日）在二○一四年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位司法機構成員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們:",
            "今日我們再次聚首一堂，迎接新的法律年度。我代表律政司歡迎各位嘉賓，特別是從其他司法管轄區遠道而來參加是次典禮的嘉賓。",
            "雖然典禮看似儀式化，但法律年度開啟典禮是在多個普通法司法管轄區中流傳已久的傳統。作為大中華地區中唯一的普通法司法管轄區，法律年度開啟典禮在香港有獨特意義，它顯示普通法的傳統在「一國兩制」下仍充滿生命力。不用多說，法律年度開啟典禮亦是回顧過去，展望將來的恰當時機。",
            "容許我先談法治。法治是大眾公認的核心價值。在每個文明社會，法治能確保政府不會超越其法律權限。就律政司而言，我們將繼續竭盡所能維護香港的法治。",
            "行政當局堅守法治固然極為重要。但同樣重要的是，社會上不同界別及至整個社會亦必須尊重法治，並避免進行可能破壞法治的行為。香港作為一個大都會，有不同意見和訴求是自然不過的事。大家亦會以不同方式表達意見和訴求。正因如此，《基本法》確保的言論自由和其他基本權利尤為重要。然而，若真正尊重法治，則不單政府，社會整體及社會的每一份子，也應尊重法治，並只在法律容許的範圍內行使他們的權利。即使為了觀乎崇高的理念，任何蓄意的違法行為也不應鼓勵。",
            "司法獨立是法治重要的一環。《基本法》第85條確保香港司法獨立。",
            "法庭處理甚麼案件不盡由法官決定。即使案件可能極具爭議性，當案件依據相關法律程序展開後，法官別無他選，必須依據相關法律和證據判案。",
            "諸如涉及《基本法》賦與的權利或環保議題等案件，很多具爭議性的判決往往引起傳媒關注，甚或引發激烈辯論。此種情況完全可以理解。新聞自由和言論自由必須容許就法庭的判決進行恰當和真誠討論。正如艾特大法官曾指出（註一），「公義並非與世隔絕的美德，她必須經得起監察及一般人敬重但敢言的批評」。",
            "然而，就法庭判決作恰當的討論甚或批評是一回事，但辱罵性的攻擊，或會削弱司法獨立和公眾對司法制度的信心的不當行為則完全是另一回事。正如梅師賢爵士指出（註二），法庭「不應成為不負責任批評的目標。公眾信心對保持司法制度的健全性極為重要，一旦消失或受損害則往往不能輕易修補」。",
            "同樣地，Sydney Kentridge爵士指出（註三）：",
            "「……獨立在此範疇不單意味獨立於政府指示，亦意味在盡可能的情況下，法官判案時不應受公眾輿論、或政府及任何個人、黨派或壓力團體所影響。其中對司法獨立特別構成威脅的一個趨勢，是政客及傳媒往往因法官作出他們不同意的判決，而放縱地斥責法官。",
            "有云法官應有廣闊的肩膀，而事實上法官亦一般如是。但就法官的意圖和誠信作出不恰當的攻擊，其真正損害不在於法官的感受，而在於削弱公眾對司法機構的尊重。若司法機構得不到公眾敬重，法治的根基也會隨之而受損害。」",
            "去年芸芸就法庭判決和法官的討論整體上均為良性，但有一點令人關注的是，辱罵式的批評有冒起的跡象。有個別人士更表示會蒐集一些他們認為有政治偏見的法官，要求他們辭退。即使這些人士的主觀意圖也許是出於好意，此等行為也不應予以鼓勵。在二○○○年的法律年度開啟典禮的致辭中，當時的終審法院首席法官李國能談及，當法庭受到不恰當的攻擊時，政府有憲制責任解釋及維護司法獨立的根本原則。律政司將會毫不猶豫地採取必要措施維護司法獨立。",
            "除引起討論外，具爭議性的案件也會為法律改革帶來動力。涉及變性人結婚的權利一案，即W案[2013] 3 HKLRD 90，便是一個好例子。除了修改《婚姻條例》及《婚姻訴訟條例》的相關條款（註四），以糾正現行機制不合憲之處，當局現正成立一個由律政司司長領導的跨部門工作小組，就性別承認涉及的法律問題作全面研究。該工作小組的目標，是考慮應否立法保障變性人的法律權利。",
            "正如我在其他場合亦有提出，法律改革對維護法治發揮重要作用。我們身處轉變甚快的時代，隨社會發展，我們的法律亦必須作出相應改變，以切合社會的需要。為此，法律改革委員會在去年展開四項新研究，即：（1）檔案法；（2）公開資料；（3）《刑事訴訟程序條例》附表三所列的例外罪行；及（4）由第三方資助仲裁。為提升對法律改革的興趣，我們最近亦舉辦首屆法律改革徵文比賽，題目為「婚前協議應否在香港獲得承認和強制執行？」",
            "我們的另一重要工作是刑事檢控。為確保我們的檢控政策能與時並進，刑事檢控科就先前的《檢控政策及常規》進行了全面檢討，並在考慮刑法的最新發展和國際趨勢後，發布新的《檢控守則》。此外，為了能緊貼其他司法管轄區的最新發展，及研究如何完善刑事司法制度，我們在去年舉辦了多個研討會及會議，當中例子包括第十二屆檢控機構首長會議，及題為「辯論：刑事司法改革」的研討會。",
            "在去年，我們失去了刑事檢控科最重要的成員，他現時已是薛偉成法官。雖然如此，我有信心，在新刑事撿控專員楊家雄資深大律師的領導下，我們的刑事檢控科將繼續獨立、專業及公平地為香港提供檢控服務。",
            "去年在這場合，我說香港有優勢成為亞太區重要的法律及解決爭議中心。現今情況亦然。律政司將繼續致力推動香港在這方面的優勢。在去年間，我和我的同事出席了多項在香港、內地及其他地方（包括北京、廈門、海牙、倫敦、澳門和首爾）的活動，旨在推廣香港的法律及解決爭議服務。",
            "就未來的計劃，我希望特別談談以下幾項新措施。",
            "首先，應我們的邀請，中國海事仲裁委員會已同意在香港設立分支機構。我的同事正跟進相關安排，期望該分支機構會很快正式成立。我們相信此舉將提升香港在國際海事仲裁方面的競爭力。",
            "第二，如聯合國和其他組織公布的數字顯示，國際投資仲裁越來越普及。總部在海牙的常設仲裁法院為一享有領導地位、歷史悠久及在這領域享負盛名的國際組織。應我們的要求，中央政府與常設仲裁法院正就東道國協定進行商談，務求在香港處理常設仲裁法院的投資仲裁案件。有關商談進展良好。我期望商談能在短期內完成，令香港可處理更多投資仲裁案件。",
            "第三，大家也許記得，政府於去年十二月宣布，將前中區政府合署西座部分辦公空間留給法律、解決爭議等相關機構（特別是國際或海外機構）。我很高興可以向大家宣布，該政策得到進一步延續，在終審法院由現時的前法國外方傳道會大樓遷往昃臣道8號後，律政司將接管前法國外方傳道會大樓，從而擴大可分配給法律及解決爭議機構的空間。此計劃與律政司及與法律相關的團體將遷往前中區政府合署的計劃相互配合，並能令該地段發展成為香港未來的「法律樞紐」。",
            "第四，為了加強協調和有策略地規劃國際仲裁的未來發展，我們快將成立由相關持份者代表組成的仲裁諮詢委員會，希望從而能令仲裁的拓展更上一層樓。",
            "最後，我希望談一談政制發展。在去年十二月四日，當局正式展開二零一七年行政長官及二零一六年立法會產生辦法的公眾諮詢。作為律政司司長，我很榮幸能有機會參與是次重要政制發展的工作。政府定當致力在社會上凝聚共識，我借此機會呼籲法律界的成員為此歷史性的政制發展作出正面貢獻。",
            "最後，我祝願各位及各位的家人有一個愉快及豐盛的二○一四年。",

            "Another important aspect of our work is criminal prosecutions",
            "To ensure that our prosecution policy is up to date, the Prosecutions Division has embarked on a comprehensive review of the previous Statement of Prosecution Policy and Practice, and released a new Prosecution Code, which took into account the latest developments of criminal jurisprudence and international trends",
            "Further, in order to keep abreast of developments in other jurisdictions and to consider how our criminal justice system can be improved, various seminars and conferences were held during the past year",
            "Examples include the 12th Heads of Prosecuting Agencies Conference and the seminar entitled \"The Debates: Criminal Justice Reform\".",
            "During the year, we have lost our most important member of the prosecutions team to the Judiciary, who is now the Honourable Mr Justice Zervos",
            "That said, I am confident that our Prosecutions Division, under the leadership of our new Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, will continue to discharge its duties by providing a prosecution service which is independent, professional and fair.",
            "Centre for International Legal and Dispute Resolution Services",
            "Last year, I said Hong Kong is well placed to be a leading centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region",
            "This remains the case, and the Department of Justice would continue with its efforts to enhance Hong Kong's strength in this regard",
            "Indeed, during the past year, I and my colleagues have attended numerous events within and outside Hong Kong (including places like Beijing, Xiamen, the Hague, London, Macau and Seoul) to promote Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "As regards the plan for the future, may I highlight the following new initiatives.",
            "First, upon our invitation, the China Maritime Arbitration Commission has agreed to set up a branch organisation in Hong Kong",
            "My colleagues are following up on the logistical details and we believe the branch would soon come to fruition",
            "This move, we believe, would enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness in the field of international maritime arbitration.",
            "Second, as reflected by the figures released by the United Nations and other bodies, international investment arbitration is getting more and more popular",
            "With its headquarters in the Hague, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) is a leading international institution with a long history and good reputation in this field",
            "At our request, the Central People's Government and the PCA have commenced negotiation of a host country agreement on the conduct of dispute settlement proceedings in Hong Kong",
            "The negotiation is making good progress, and I look forward to its finalisation in the near future so that more investment arbitrations would be conducted in Hong Kong.",
            "Third, as you may recall, the Government announced in December 2012 that it would allocate certain office space in the West Wing of the former Central Government Offices to legal and dispute resolution institutions (especially international or overseas institutions)",
            "As a follow up of this policy, I am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice will take over the former French Mission Building upon the relocation of the Court of Final Appeal to No",
            "8 Jackson Road, with a view to increasing the space that can be provided to legal and dispute resolution institutions",
            "This will fit in well with the former Central Government Offices being used as the future home for the Department of Justice and law-related organisations, as well as enabling the whole area to become the future \"legal hub\" of Hong Kong.",
            "Fourth, with a view to enhancing better co-ordination and strategic planning for the development of international arbitration, a new advisory committee on the promotion of arbitration comprising representatives of the key stakeholders will soon be established",
            "With this new committee, it is hoped that the development of arbitration would be taken to a new height.",
            "Constitutional Development",
            "One last area that I would like to cover is constitutional development",
            "On December 4 last year, the Administration formally launched the Public Consultation on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016",
            "As the Secretary for Justice, I am honoured to have the opportunity to take part in this important constitutional development",
            "The Administration is firmly committed to forging consensus within the community on this important matter, and I urge members of the legal community to make positive contributions in this historical exercise.",
            "On this note, may I wish all of you and your families a happy and prosperous year of 2014",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（一月十三日）在二○一四年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位司法機構成員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們:",
            "今日我們再次聚首一堂，迎接新的法律年度",
            "我代表律政司歡迎各位嘉賓，特別是從其他司法管轄區遠道而來參加是次典禮的嘉賓",
            "雖然典禮看似儀式化，但法律年度開啟典禮是在多個普通法司法管轄區中流傳已久的傳統",
            "作為大中華地區中唯一的普通法司法管轄區，法律年度開啟典禮在香港有獨特意義，它顯示普通法的傳統在「一國兩制」下仍充滿生命力",
            "不用多說，法律年度開啟典禮亦是回顧過去，展望將來的恰當時機",
            "容許我先談法治",
            "法治是大眾公認的核心價值",
            "在每個文明社會，法治能確保政府不會超越其法律權限",
            "就律政司而言，我們將繼續竭盡所能維護香港的法治",
            "行政當局堅守法治固然極為重要",
            "但同樣重要的是，社會上不同界別及至整個社會亦必須尊重法治，並避免進行可能破壞法治的行為",
            "香港作為一個大都會，有不同意見和訴求是自然不過的事",
            "大家亦會以不同方式表達意見和訴求",
            "正因如此，《基本法》確保的言論自由和其他基本權利尤為重要",
            "然而，若真正尊重法治，則不單政府，社會整體及社會的每一份子，也應尊重法治，並只在法律容許的範圍內行使他們的權利",
            "即使為了觀乎崇高的理念，任何蓄意的違法行為也不應鼓勵",
            "司法獨立是法治重要的一環",
            "《基本法》第85條確保香港司法獨立",
            "法庭處理甚麼案件不盡由法官決定",
            "即使案件可能極具爭議性，當案件依據相關法律程序展開後，法官別無他選，必須依據相關法律和證據判案",
            "諸如涉及《基本法》賦與的權利或環保議題等案件，很多具爭議性的判決往往引起傳媒關注，甚或引發激烈辯論",
            "此種情況完全可以理解",
            "新聞自由和言論自由必須容許就法庭的判決進行恰當和真誠討論",
            "正如艾特大法官曾指出（註一），「公義並非與世隔絕的美德，她必須經得起監察及一般人敬重但敢言的批評」",
            "然而，就法庭判決作恰當的討論甚或批評是一回事，但辱罵性的攻擊，或會削弱司法獨立和公眾對司法制度的信心的不當行為則完全是另一回事",
            "正如梅師賢爵士指出（註二），法庭「不應成為不負責任批評的目標",
            "公眾信心對保持司法制度的健全性極為重要，一旦消失或受損害則往往不能輕易修補」",
            "同樣地，Sydney Kentridge爵士指出（註三）：",
            "「……獨立在此範疇不單意味獨立於政府指示，亦意味在盡可能的情況下，法官判案時不應受公眾輿論、或政府及任何個人、黨派或壓力團體所影響",
            "其中對司法獨立特別構成威脅的一個趨勢，是政客及傳媒往往因法官作出他們不同意的判決，而放縱地斥責法官",
            "有云法官應有廣闊的肩膀，而事實上法官亦一般如是",
            "但就法官的意圖和誠信作出不恰當的攻擊，其真正損害不在於法官的感受，而在於削弱公眾對司法機構的尊重",
            "若司法機構得不到公眾敬重，法治的根基也會隨之而受損害」",
            "去年芸芸就法庭判決和法官的討論整體上均為良性，但有一點令人關注的是，辱罵式的批評有冒起的跡象",
            "有個別人士更表示會蒐集一些他們認為有政治偏見的法官，要求他們辭退",
            "即使這些人士的主觀意圖也許是出於好意，此等行為也不應予以鼓勵",
            "在二○○○年的法律年度開啟典禮的致辭中，當時的終審法院首席法官李國能談及，當法庭受到不恰當的攻擊時，政府有憲制責任解釋及維護司法獨立的根本原則",
            "律政司將會毫不猶豫地採取必要措施維護司法獨立",
            "除引起討論外，具爭議性的案件也會為法律改革帶來動力",
            "涉及變性人結婚的權利一案，即W案[2013] 3 HKLRD 90，便是一個好例子",
            "除了修改《婚姻條例》及《婚姻訴訟條例》的相關條款（註四），以糾正現行機制不合憲之處，當局現正成立一個由律政司司長領導的跨部門工作小組，就性別承認涉及的法律問題作全面研究",
            "該工作小組的目標，是考慮應否立法保障變性人的法律權利",
            "正如我在其他場合亦有提出，法律改革對維護法治發揮重要作用",
            "我們身處轉變甚快的時代，隨社會發展，我們的法律亦必須作出相應改變，以切合社會的需要",
            "為此，法律改革委員會在去年展開四項新研究，即：（1）檔案法；（2）公開資料；（3）《刑事訴訟程序條例》附表三所列的例外罪行；及（4）由第三方資助仲裁",
            "為提升對法律改革的興趣，我們最近亦舉辦首屆法律改革徵文比賽，題目為「婚前協議應否在香港獲得承認和強制執行？」",
            "我們的另一重要工作是刑事檢控",
            "為確保我們的檢控政策能與時並進，刑事檢控科就先前的《檢控政策及常規》進行了全面檢討，並在考慮刑法的最新發展和國際趨勢後，發布新的《檢控守則》",
            "此外，為了能緊貼其他司法管轄區的最新發展，及研究如何完善刑事司法制度，我們在去年舉辦了多個研討會及會議，當中例子包括第十二屆檢控機構首長會議，及題為「辯論：刑事司法改革」的研討會",
            "在去年，我們失去了刑事檢控科最重要的成員，他現時已是薛偉成法官",
            "雖然如此，我有信心，在新刑事撿控專員楊家雄資深大律師的領導下，我們的刑事檢控科將繼續獨立、專業及公平地為香港提供檢控服務",
            "去年在這場合，我說香港有優勢成為亞太區重要的法律及解決爭議中心",
            "現今情況亦然",
            "律政司將繼續致力推動香港在這方面的優勢",
            "在去年間，我和我的同事出席了多項在香港、內地及其他地方（包括北京、廈門、海牙、倫敦、澳門和首爾）的活動，旨在推廣香港的法律及解決爭議服務",
            "就未來的計劃，我希望特別談談以下幾項新措施",
            "首先，應我們的邀請，中國海事仲裁委員會已同意在香港設立分支機構",
            "我的同事正跟進相關安排，期望該分支機構會很快正式成立",
            "我們相信此舉將提升香港在國際海事仲裁方面的競爭力",
            "第二，如聯合國和其他組織公布的數字顯示，國際投資仲裁越來越普及",
            "總部在海牙的常設仲裁法院為一享有領導地位、歷史悠久及在這領域享負盛名的國際組織",
            "應我們的要求，中央政府與常設仲裁法院正就東道國協定進行商談，務求在香港處理常設仲裁法院的投資仲裁案件",
            "有關商談進展良好",
            "我期望商談能在短期內完成，令香港可處理更多投資仲裁案件",
            "第三，大家也許記得，政府於去年十二月宣布，將前中區政府合署西座部分辦公空間留給法律、解決爭議等相關機構（特別是國際或海外機構）",
            "我很高興可以向大家宣布，該政策得到進一步延續，在終審法院由現時的前法國外方傳道會大樓遷往昃臣道8號後，律政司將接管前法國外方傳道會大樓，從而擴大可分配給法律及解決爭議機構的空間",
            "此計劃與律政司及與法律相關的團體將遷往前中區政府合署的計劃相互配合，並能令該地段發展成為香港未來的「法律樞紐」",
            "第四，為了加強協調和有策略地規劃國際仲裁的未來發展，我們快將成立由相關持份者代表組成的仲裁諮詢委員會，希望從而能令仲裁的拓展更上一層樓",
            "最後，我希望談一談政制發展",
            "在去年十二月四日，當局正式展開二零一七年行政長官及二零一六年立法會產生辦法的公眾諮詢",
            "作為律政司司長，我很榮幸能有機會參與是次重要政制發展的工作",
            "政府定當致力在社會上凝聚共識，我借此機會呼籲法律界的成員為此歷史性的政制發展作出正面貢獻",
            "最後，我祝願各位及各位的家人有一個愉快及豐盛的二○一四年",
            "註四︰建議中的草案將修訂《婚姻條例》的文本，而該等修訂亦適用於解釋《婚姻訴訟條例》的有關條文",
