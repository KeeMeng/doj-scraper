            "The opening of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2020 was held today (November 2) at the former French Mission Building. Today also marked the opening of the Hong Kong Legal Hub and the official launch of the \"Vision 2030 for Rule of Law\" (\"Vision 2030\"). This remarkable event signified an important milestone in the Department of Justice's work on enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international legal hub for legal, deal-making and dispute resolution services, as well as promoting and strengthening the rule of law.",
            "The Hong Kong Legal Hub comprises the offices of the Department of Justice housed in the historical building of the former Central Government Offices, the former French Mission Building which is a declared monument and part of Two Exchange Square. By consolidating top-notch local, regional and international law-related organisations in the heart of the central business district, the Hong Kong Legal Hub will attract global legal and dispute resolution talents to Hong Kong, providing a platform for the provision of premier legal services which will significantly contribute to business and economic growth in this region and beyond (www.legalhub.gov.hk).",
            "\"Vision 2030\" is a 10-year visionary initiative which seeks to promote the proper understanding and recognition of the rule of law through professional exchanges, research and capacity building with stakeholders including youths, legal practitioners and academics, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of inclusive and rule-based societies at both the local and international levels.",
            "The Hong Kong Legal Week is an annual flagship event of the Department of Justice. In response to the challenges posed by COVID-19, for the first time, the opening ceremony and a series of webinars will be broadcast live from November 2 to 6. As part of the \"Vision 2030\" initiative and in support of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Inaugural Rule of Law Congress, with the theme \"Towards 2030: A Decade of Action for Rule of Law\" will be held tomorrow (November 3). Renowned local and international legal professionals, academics and experts will share their insights and experiences on legal and dispute resolution issues of current times through an array of webinars during the week.
