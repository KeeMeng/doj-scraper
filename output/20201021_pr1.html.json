            "Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (October 21):",
            "Question:",
            "The issue of whether the jury system should be extended to the District Court has been discussed repeatedly over the years. In June 2015, the Department of Justice provided, at the request of the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services of this Council, information on the estimated overall resource implications if jury trials were to be introduced in the District Court. Such resource implications included the construction of a new purpose-built court building with suitable and adequate facilities in support of jury trials at the District Court level. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the following figures, in each of the past two years and in this year (up to September 30), in respect of trials of indictable offences heard in the (i) Magistrates' Courts, (ii) District Court and (iii) Court of First Instance, as well as the respective total numbers of criminal trials: Court levelNumber of trials of indictable offencesTotal number of",

            "(4) of the estimated additional number of jurors needed for extending the jury system to the District Court; and",
            "(5) as the Judiciary has accepted using a portion of the Caroline Hill Road site for the development of a new District Court Complex, whether the authorities have planned for facilities required for enabling jury trials therein; if not, of the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "As pointed out by the Government in past discussions at the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services of the Legislative Council (LegCo) and in its previous written reply to relevant LegCo question, the current system of trial by judge alone at the District Court level has worked well over the years since its introduction in the 1950s. The introduction of the jury system to the District Court should only be taken forward if there are strong merits and upon careful consideration of the significant changes and profound implications to be brought to the entire criminal justice system.",
            "In relation to Hon Dennis Kwok’s questions, the Department of Justice (DoJ), after consulting the Judiciary, replies as follows:",
            "(1) Based on the information provided by the Judiciary, the numbers of criminal trials in Magistrates’ Courts, the District Court and the Court of First Instance (CFI) as at June 30, 2020 are set out in Annex 1.",
            "(2) The Judiciary does not maintain relevant statistics.",
            "(3) The current system of trial by judge alone at the District Court level has sufficiently protected the rights of all parties to a fair trial. We consider that there are at present no strong merits for changing the system.",
            "Judicial independence is the cornerstone for safeguarding the rule of law in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s judges have all along been discharging their judicial duties in an independent and impartial manner, and the current trial system of the District Court has worked well over the years. A defendant is also subject to a fair trial by a judge alone in the District Court. In paragraph 9 of its judgment in Chiang Lily v Secretary for Justice ((2010) 13 HKCFAR 208), the Court of Final Appeal expressly rejected that a trial in the District Court was less fair by virtue of being a non-jury trial.",
            "As a matter of fact, neither the Basic Law nor the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance confers on a defendant in criminal proceedings the right to choose trial by jury. Article 81 of the Basic Law stipulates, among other things, that the judicial system previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained. Article 86 of the Basic Law provides that the principle of trial by jury previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained. Article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights guarantees that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit of law. The Court of Appeal of the High Court held in Chiang Lily v Secretary for Justice (CACV 55 & 151/2009) that a defendant does not have the right to choose trial by jury in criminal trials in Hong Kong. This principle was confirmed by the Court of Final Appeal in Chiang Lily v Secretary for Justice ((2010) 13 HKCFAR 208). We also note that the European Court of Human Rights has also ruled that the right to fair trial under Article 6 (1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (comparable to Article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights though the European legal system may not be entirely applicable to Hong Kong) does not include the defendant’s right to choose to be tried before a jury (see Twomey, Cameron and Guthrie v The United Kingdom, Applications nos. 67318/09 and 22226/12, paragraph 30).",
            "It is worth noting that the benefit that a judge alone trial confers on a defendant is that the court is required to give reasons for verdict (instead of only summing up to the jury by the judge), which is advantageous to the convicted defendant, as well as the public, in both understanding the reasons for why the defendant is being convicted and formulating grounds of appeal against his conviction.",
            "As pointed out by the Court of Final Appeal in Chiang Lily v Secretary for Justice ((2010) 13 HKCFAR 208), choice of the prosecution venue is clearly a matter covered by Article 63 of the Basic Law where the Secretary for Justice shall control criminal prosecutions free from any interference. When conducting prosecutions, the DoJ’s prosecutors have all along been handling all criminal cases professionally and in strict accordance with the law and the relevant guidelines in the Prosecution Code, and have been applying the highest standards in maintaining the proper administration of justice. When deciding the venue for trial, a prosecutor should, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraph 8.4 of the Prosecution Code and other legally relevant factors, select an available venue for trial that will enable the relevant court to deal most appropriately with the matter and impose an adequate sentence to address the criminality involved in the conduct.",
            "On the other hand, due to the differences in trial proceedings, a criminal case tried by jury would generally be more time-consuming than being tried by a judge alone. For instance, under certain circumstances, a criminal case tried by jury may need to undergo the voir dire procedure in the absence of jury to decide the admissibility of evidence (usually the defendant’s admission). That evidence, if admitted by the judge, shall together with other relevant evidence be heard and considered by the jury. The judge guiding the jury and deliberation by the jury will also lengthen the time taken in trying the case.",
            "With reference to the statistics published in the Hong Kong Judiciary Annual Report 2019, the average waiting time at the District Court level in 2017 to 2019 was on the rise, and far exceeded the target waiting time (see Annex 2).",
            "Article 87 of the Basic Law protects the right of a defendant “to a fair trial by the judicial organs without delay”. Article 11(2)(c) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights also protects the right of a defendant “to be tried without undue delay”. The public and, importantly, accused persons awaiting trial are entitled to expect justice to be administered without unnecessary delay. Excessive waiting time will add to the tension of victims, defendants, particularly those in custody awaiting trial, and witnesses (see HKSAR v Hon Ming Kong [2014] 2 HKLRD 710, paragraphs 7 and 8). If the jury system is extended to the District Court, it is reasonably expected that the time required for trying a number of cases will increase significantly, hence longer waiting time of criminal cases at the District Court level. Excessive waiting time for criminal cases is of no benefit to the defendant (whether or not he is convicted), victims and public interest.",
            "(4) As indicated previously by the Judiciary, the resource implications of introducing jury trials to the District Court would be extremely substantial and far-reaching, including additional space and facilities required to cater for jury trials, manpower (involving judges, supporting staff and jurors) and related expenditure.",
            "Regarding the information requested in the question, although the Government is unable to assess at this stage the additional number of jurors required if all cases in the District Court are tried before a judge and jury in the future, it can be inferred from the two sets of statistical figures in the past three years on the numbers of (a) criminal cases tried by jury in the CFI, and (b) criminal trials in the District Court (see Annex 3) that the arrangement of extending the jury system to the District Court will substantially increase by folds the number of jurors required. The expenses involved will include the provision of suitable accommodation, the costs of administrative staff and of allowances paid to those who serve as jurors. Moreover, there is also an indirect cost on self-employed jurors and on the employers of those jurors who are employed, consequential to their absence from work.",
            "(5) According to the Judiciary, given no plans currently to introduce jury trials to the District Court, the planning for the new District Court Building is proceeded on the basis of no jury trials, as at present, in the District Court.",

            "以下是今日（十月二十一日）在立法會會議上郭榮鏗議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "多年來，應否把陪審團制度延用於區域法院的議題被多番討論。應本會司法及法律事務委員會的要求，律政司於二○一五年六月提供資料，說明若在區域法院引入陪審團審訊的預計整體資源影響。有關的資源影響包括需興建一幢專供法院使用的新大樓，而大樓內須設有合適和足夠設施，以配合在區域法院進行陪審團審訊。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）過去兩年的每年及今年（截至九月三十日），有關在(i)裁判法院、(ii)區域法院及(iii)原訟法庭進行的可公訴罪行審訊的下列數字，以及分別的刑事審訊總數： 法院級別可公訴罪行審訊的數目刑事審訊總數",

            "（四）預計把陪審團制度延用於區域法院所需增加的陪審員人數為何；及",
            "（五）鑑於司法機構已接納使用加路連山道部分用地興建新的區域法院綜合大樓，當局有否為達致可在該大樓內進行陪審團審訊而需要的設施作出規劃；如否，原因為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "正如政府在以往立法會司法及法律事務委員會討論及相關立法會質詢的書面答覆中指出，現行在區域法院由法官單獨審訊的制度自上世紀五十年代推行以來一直行之有效。如要考慮在區域法院引入陪審團制度，須有強而有力的理據支持，並審慎考慮其對整個刑事司法制度帶來的重大轉變及深遠影響。",
            "就郭榮鏗議員的提問，經諮詢司法機構後，律政司現回覆如下。",
            "（一）根據司法機構提供的資料，截至二○二○年六月三十日，有關在裁判法院、區域法院及原訟法庭進行的刑事審訊的統計數字載於附件一。",
            "（二）司法機構沒有備存相關統計數字。",
            "（三）現行在區域法院由法官單獨審訊的制度已經充分保障了各方公平審訊的權利。我們認為現時缺乏強而有力的理據支持改變有關制度。",
            "司法獨立是維護香港法治的基石。香港的法官一直以獨立而公正的方式執行司法職務，而現行區域法院的審訊制度多年來一直行之有效。被告人在區域法院由一名法官單獨審訊，同樣可獲得公平審訊。終審法院在蔣麗莉 訴 律政司司長（（2010）13 HKCFAR 208）的判詞第9段明確否定區域法院因不設陪審團制度而會導致其審訊不公的說法。",
            "事實上，《基本法》及《香港人權法案條例》並沒有賦予被告人在刑事法律程序中可選擇在有陪審團的情況下受審的權利。《基本法》第八十一條的其中一項規定是，原在香港實行的司法體制予以保留。《基本法》第八十六條訂明，原在香港實行的陪審制度的原則予以保留。《香港人權法案》第十條保證，任何人受刑事控告或因其權利義務涉訟須予判定時，有權受獨立無私的法定管轄法庭公正公開審問。高等法院上訴法庭在蔣麗莉 訴 律政司司長（民事上訴2009年第55及151號）一案中裁定，香港的刑事審訊中，被告人並無選擇由陪審團審理的權利。此原則在蔣麗莉 訴 律政司司長（（2010）13 HKCFAR 208）一案中獲終審法院確認。我們亦注意到，歐洲人權法院同樣裁定《歐洲人權公約》第6(1)條（條文與《香港人權法案》第十條相若，儘管歐洲法律體系的情況未必完全適用於香港）中有關公平審訊的權利並不包括被告人選擇由陪審團審理的權利（見Twomey, Cameron and Guthrie v The United Kingdom, Applications nos. 67318/09 and 22226/12，第30段）。",
            "值得一提的是，由專業法官單獨進行審訊所賦予被告人的益處是，法庭需給予裁決理由（而非只由法官給予陪審團結案指引），這有利於被定罪的被告人以至公眾充分理解法庭的定罪理由，亦便利被告人就其定罪擬定上訴理由。",
            "終審法院在蔣麗莉 訴 律政司司長（（2010） 13 HKCFAR 208）一案中指出，選擇進行檢控的審訊法院級別，明顯屬《基本法》第六十三條所涵蓋的事宜；該條文賦權律政司司長主管檢察工作，不受任何外界干涉。律政司檢控人員進行所有檢控工作時，一直嚴格按照法律和《檢控守則》下的相關指引專業地處理所有刑事案件，以最高標準來維持司法公義。檢控人員在選定審訊法庭時，應考慮《檢控守則》第8.4段所載的各項因素及其他法律上相關的因素，然後從可供選擇的審訊法庭中，選出最合適審理有關事宜並能對涉案罪行的刑責判處足夠刑罰的相關法庭。",
            "另一方面，基於審訊程序上的分別，由陪審團審訊的刑事案件一般都會比由單一法官審訊耗用更多時間。例如在某些情況下，由陪審團審訊的刑事案件可能先要在沒有陪審團的情況下進行「案中案」程序以決定證據（通常是被告人的招認）的可接納性。若法官裁定相關證據可予接納，該證據和相關的證供需再交由陪審團聽取及考慮；法官引導陪審團及陪審團商議亦會增加審理案件所需的時間。",
            "參考司法機構年報二○一九公布的數據，區域法院刑事案件的平均輪候時間在二○一七至二○一九年有上升趨勢，並遠遠超過目標輪候時間（見附件二）。",
            "《基本法》第八十七條保障被告人「盡早接受司法機關公正審判」的權利。《香港人權法案》第十一(二)(丙)條亦保障被告人「立即受審，不得無故稽延」的權利。公眾及被告人均有權期望司法工作執行不受不必要的延誤。案件輪候時間過長，更會增加對受害人、被告人（特別是還押的被告人）及證人的壓力（見香港特別行政區 訴 韓明光 [2014] 2 HKLRD 710，第7至8段）。若將陪審團制度延伸至區域法院的刑事案件，可以合理地預期不少案件審訊的所需時間會有顯著增加，進一步加劇區域法院刑事案件的輪候時間。刑事案件的輪候審訊時間過長，對被告人（不論其最後是否被裁定有罪）、受害人及公眾利益均無好處。",
            "（四）司法機構過往亦指出，在區域法院引入陪審團制度會對資源有極大和深遠的影響，例如配合陪審團審訊而所需的額外地方和配備，以及人手（包括法官、輔助人員及陪審員）和相關開支。",
            "就問題要求提供的資料，雖然現階段無法評估假若未來區域法院審訊全部均由法官在有陪審團的情況下進行，而額外所需的陪審員人數，不過參考過去三年有關(a)原訟法庭有陪審員審訊的刑事案件及(b)區域法院的刑事審訊案件的兩項統計數字（見附件三），已可推斷出把陪審團制度延用於區域法院的安排將需要倍增大量陪審員，而涉及的開支包括適當的住宿供應、行政人員的費用，以及向擔任陪審員的人士提供的津貼。此外，對於擔任陪審員的自僱人士，以及聘用有關陪審員的僱主來說，這亦會涉及因他們自己或其僱員未能上班而帶來的間接成本。",
            "（五）司法機構表示，由於現時並沒有引入陪審團到區域法院審訊的計劃，故此新區域法院大樓是依據現行區域法院審訊沒有陪審團的基礎下進行規劃。",

            "多年來，應否把陪審團制度延用於區域法院的議題被多番討論",

            "就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）過去兩年的每年及今年（截至九月三十日），有關在(i)裁判法院、(ii)區域法院及(iii)原訟法庭進行的可公訴罪行審訊的下列數字，以及分別的刑事審訊總數： 法院級別可公訴罪行審訊的數目刑事審訊總數",

            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "正如政府在以往立法會司法及法律事務委員會討論及相關立法會質詢的書面答覆中指出，現行在區域法院由法官單獨審訊的制度自上世紀五十年代推行以來一直行之有效",
            "如要考慮在區域法院引入陪審團制度，須有強而有力的理據支持，並審慎考慮其對整個刑事司法制度帶來的重大轉變及深遠影響",
            "就郭榮鏗議員的提問，經諮詢司法機構後，律政司現回覆如下",
            "（一）根據司法機構提供的資料，截至二○二○年六月三十日，有關在裁判法院、區域法院及原訟法庭進行的刑事審訊的統計數字載於附件一",
            "（二）司法機構沒有備存相關統計數字",
            "（三）現行在區域法院由法官單獨審訊的制度已經充分保障了各方公平審訊的權利",
            "我們認為現時缺乏強而有力的理據支持改變有關制度",
            "司法獨立是維護香港法治的基石",
            "香港的法官一直以獨立而公正的方式執行司法職務，而現行區域法院的審訊制度多年來一直行之有效",
            "被告人在區域法院由一名法官單獨審訊，同樣可獲得公平審訊",
            "終審法院在蔣麗莉 訴 律政司司長（（2010）13 HKCFAR 208）的判詞第9段明確否定區域法院因不設陪審團制度而會導致其審訊不公的說法",
            "事實上，《基本法》及《香港人權法案條例》並沒有賦予被告人在刑事法律程序中可選擇在有陪審團的情況下受審的權利",
            "《基本法》第八十一條的其中一項規定是，原在香港實行的司法體制予以保留",
            "《基本法》第八十六條訂明，原在香港實行的陪審制度的原則予以保留",
            "《香港人權法案》第十條保證，任何人受刑事控告或因其權利義務涉訟須予判定時，有權受獨立無私的法定管轄法庭公正公開審問",
            "高等法院上訴法庭在蔣麗莉 訴 律政司司長（民事上訴2009年第55及151號）一案中裁定，香港的刑事審訊中，被告人並無選擇由陪審團審理的權利",
            "此原則在蔣麗莉 訴 律政司司長（（2010）13 HKCFAR 208）一案中獲終審法院確認",
            "值得一提的是，由專業法官單獨進行審訊所賦予被告人的益處是，法庭需給予裁決理由（而非只由法官給予陪審團結案指引），這有利於被定罪的被告人以至公眾充分理解法庭的定罪理由，亦便利被告人就其定罪擬定上訴理由",
            "終審法院在蔣麗莉 訴 律政司司長（（2010） 13 HKCFAR 208）一案中指出，選擇進行檢控的審訊法院級別，明顯屬《基本法》第六十三條所涵蓋的事宜；該條文賦權律政司司長主管檢察工作，不受任何外界干涉",
            "律政司檢控人員進行所有檢控工作時，一直嚴格按照法律和《檢控守則》下的相關指引專業地處理所有刑事案件，以最高標準來維持司法公義",
            "檢控人員在選定審訊法庭時，應考慮《檢控守則》第8.4段所載的各項因素及其他法律上相關的因素，然後從可供選擇的審訊法庭中，選出最合適審理有關事宜並能對涉案罪行的刑責判處足夠刑罰的相關法庭",
            "另一方面，基於審訊程序上的分別，由陪審團審訊的刑事案件一般都會比由單一法官審訊耗用更多時間",
            "例如在某些情況下，由陪審團審訊的刑事案件可能先要在沒有陪審團的情況下進行「案中案」程序以決定證據（通常是被告人的招認）的可接納性",
            "若法官裁定相關證據可予接納，該證據和相關的證供需再交由陪審團聽取及考慮；法官引導陪審團及陪審團商議亦會增加審理案件所需的時間",
            "參考司法機構年報二○一九公布的數據，區域法院刑事案件的平均輪候時間在二○一七至二○一九年有上升趨勢，並遠遠超過目標輪候時間（見附件二）",
            "《基本法》第八十七條保障被告人「盡早接受司法機關公正審判」的權利",
            "《香港人權法案》第十一(二)(丙)條亦保障被告人「立即受審，不得無故稽延」的權利",

            "案件輪候時間過長，更會增加對受害人、被告人（特別是還押的被告人）及證人的壓力（見香港特別行政區 訴 韓明光 [2014] 2 HKLRD 710，第7至8段）",
            "若將陪審團制度延伸至區域法院的刑事案件，可以合理地預期不少案件審訊的所需時間會有顯著增加，進一步加劇區域法院刑事案件的輪候時間",
            "刑事案件的輪候審訊時間過長，對被告人（不論其最後是否被裁定有罪）、受害人及公眾利益均無好處",
            "（四）司法機構過往亦指出，在區域法院引入陪審團制度會對資源有極大和深遠的影響，例如配合陪審團審訊而所需的額外地方和配備，以及人手（包括法官、輔助人員及陪審員）和相關開支",
            "就問題要求提供的資料，雖然現階段無法評估假若未來區域法院審訊全部均由法官在有陪審團的情況下進行，而額外所需的陪審員人數，不過參考過去三年有關(a)原訟法庭有陪審員審訊的刑事案件及(b)區域法院的刑事審訊案件的兩項統計數字（見附件三），已可推斷出把陪審團制度延用於區域法院的安排將需要倍增大量陪審員，而涉及的開支包括適當的住宿供應、行政人員的費用，以及向擔任陪審員的人士提供的津貼",
            "此外，對於擔任陪審員的自僱人士，以及聘用有關陪審員的僱主來說，這亦會涉及因他們自己或其僱員未能上班而帶來的間接成本",
            "（五）司法機構表示，由於現時並沒有引入陪審團到區域法院審訊的計劃，故此新區域法院大樓是依據現行區域法院審訊沒有陪審團的基礎下進行規劃",
