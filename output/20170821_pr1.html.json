            "In response to queries raised by some members of the public in respect of the two Court of Appeal cases respectively concerning 13 persons taking part in unlawful assembly outside the Legislative Council building (CAAR 3/2016) and concerning Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow (CAAR 4/2016), the Department of Justice (DoJ) gave the following response today (August 21):",
            "In the aforesaid two applications for review of sentences concluded last week on August 15 and 17, 2017, the Court of Appeal has already taken into account the number of hours of community service respectively served by the defendants and made discounts to the ultimate sentences imposed. For instance, in CAAR 4/2016, the Court of Appeal reduced one month to each of the sentences of Joshua Wong and Nathan Law from the starting point (see para 170 of the judgment). This is consistent with the court's practice when an immediate custodial sentence is imposed upon a review of or appeal against sentence whilst the respondent has completed the community service order. There is therefore no question of double jeopardy or being sentenced twice.",
            "Further, the applications for review of sentences in both cases were not instituted after the defendants had served their original sentences. In CAAR 3/2016, the application for leave to review the sentences was made to the Court of Appeal within 21 days after the imposition of the original sentence. In CAAR 4/2016, the Prosecution within 14 days of the sentence being imposed applied for a review of the sentences before the trial Magistrate in August 2016 under section 104 of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap 227). The defendants of the two cases, at that time, had not started to serve their community service orders. Therefore, there is no question of the DoJ applying for review of the sentences after the defendants had completed the original sentences.",
            "Upon the dismissal of that review in September 2016, the DoJ applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to review the sentence and the Court of Appeal granted leave to the DoJ in October 2016. In other words, the applications for review were made within the time limit prescribed by the legislation. There is therefore no question of a vendetta as asserted at all. The review of the sentences in both cases could be heard until their respective appeals against convictions had been dismissed (CAAR 3/2016) and abandoned (CAAR 4/2016) (see DoJ's statement of August 17, 2017).",
            "The DoJ reiterates that the two aforesaid cases were handled according to the applicable laws, and that there is no question of \"political prosecutions\" whatsoever.",

            "就部分社會人士對上訴法庭處理十三人參與立法會外非法集結案件（CAAR 3/2016），以及黃之鋒、羅冠聰和周永康三人案件（CAAR 4/2016）的查詢，律政司今日（八月二十一日）作以下回應︰",
            "上述兩宗刑期覆核的申請案件已分別於二○一七年八月十五和十七日結案，上訴法庭判處最終刑期時，已考慮相關被告已完成其社會服務令，並給予刑期扣減。就如CAAR 4/2016一案中，上訴法庭已從兩名答辯人黃之鋒、羅冠聰的量刑起點，各扣減一個月刑期（參見判詞第一百七十段）。法庭這做法與過去處理刑期覆核或上訴案一致，即當答辯人已完成社會服務令，而又被上訴法庭判處即時監禁時的做法一致，當中並不存在所謂的「雙重追訴」或「雙重判刑」的情況。",
            "再者，律政司並非在被告完成原來的刑罰後才提出刑期覆核。就CAAR 3/2016一案，律政司是於判刑後的二十一日內向上訴法庭申請提出刑期覆核的許可；而就CAAR 4/2016一案，控方在二○一六年八月， 即判刑後十四天內， 根據《裁判官條例》（第227章）第104條向主審裁判官申請刑期覆核。兩案的被告當時還沒有開始履行其社會服務令，因此不存在被告完成原來的刑罰後才提出刑期覆核。",
            "該刑期覆核申請在二○一六年九月被駁回後，律政司向上訴法庭申請刑期覆核許可，而上訴法庭在二○一六年十月批出許可。換言之，覆核申請是在法例指定的期限內提出，因此完全不存在所謂「秋後算賬」的情況，而有關刑期覆核是不能在被告就其定罪提出的上訴被駁回（CAAR 3/2016），和被告撤回其定罪上訴（CAAR 4/2016）前進行聆訊的（請參閱律政司八月十七日發出的聲明）。",
            "律政司重申，上述兩宗案件完全依據適用法律處理，不存在所謂「政治檢控」。",
