            "Following is the translation of the speech made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in moving the second reading of the Arbitration and Mediation Legislation (Third Party Funding) (Amendment) Bill 2016 at the Legislative Council meeting today (January 11):",
            "President,",
            "I move that the Arbitration and Mediation Legislation (Third Party Funding) (Amendment) Bill 2016 (Bill) be read the second time. The main objective of the Bill is to amend the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) and the Mediation Ordinance (Cap 620) to clarify that third party funding of arbitration, mediation and related proceedings is permitted under Hong Kong law.",
            "The proposed amendments were formulated on the basis of the recommendations made in the Report on Third Party Funding for Arbitration (Report) published by the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC) in October 2016 and the views of the Steering Committee on Mediation.",
            "Whether third party funding of arbitration is permitted under Hong Kong law",
            "The Government has a long-standing policy of promoting Hong Kong as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region. In recent years, third party funding of arbitration and other dispute resolution proceedings has become increasingly common in various jurisdictions, including Australia, England and Wales, various European jurisdictions and the United States. To date, third party funding arrangements have usually been motivated by a funded party's lack of financial resources to pursue its own claims in contentious proceedings. However, increasingly, parties who do have the financial resources to fund contentious proceedings may also seek third party funding as a financial or risk management tool.",
            "Hong Kong is one of the major international arbitration centres in the Asia Pacific region. It is likely that a party to an arbitration taking place in Hong Kong may wish to consider whether or not it should seek third party funding of its participation in such an arbitration if it is clearly permitted by Hong Kong law to do so.",
            "The Hong Kong Courts do not object, in principle, to third party funding of arbitration and related proceedings (including mediation). However, it is currently unclear whether the common law doctrines of maintenance and champerty also apply to third party funding of arbitration taking place in Hong Kong. Indeed, a Court of Final Appeal judgment handed down in 2007 (Note) expressly left open this question. As there is uncertainty as to whether third party funding of arbitration is permitted under the current Hong Kong law, the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a venue of arbitration may be affected. This may also affect the competitiveness of Hong Kong as an arbitration centre in handling cross-border investment and commercial disputes.",
            "The review and recommendations by the LRC",
            "Against the above background, I, together with the Chief Justice, asked the LRC in June 2013 to set up a sub-committee to review the current position relating to third party funding of arbitration for the purpose of considering whether reform is needed. In October 2015, the sub-committee published a consultation paper proposing that third party funding for arbitration taking place in Hong Kong should be permitted under Hong Kong law.",
            "Based on the submissions received during the public consultation period, the LRC published the Report in October 2016, concluding that the reform of Hong Kong law is needed to state that the common law doctrines of maintenance and champerty do not prevent third party funding of arbitration and associated proceedings under the Arbitration Ordinance.",
            "The LRC recommended that third party funders funding arbitration should be required to comply with a Code of Practice issued by a body authorised under the Arbitration Ordinance. The Code should also set out the standards (including financial and ethical standards) and practices with which third party funders would ordinarily be expected to comply when carrying on the funding activities.",
            "The LRC also recommended that consideration should be given to whether to make consequential amendments at the same time to the Mediation Ordinance to extend the above proposals to mediation within the scope of the Mediation Ordinance.",
            "The Government responses to the Report",
            "The Government considers that, from the perspective of promoting Hong Kong as an international dispute resolution centre and for the purpose of clarifying the law, the proposed law reform is desirable. It is important that Hong Kong, as one of the leading centres for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region, can keep up with the latest international development and thereby enhance its competitive position.",
            "Consultation",
            "Following the release of the Report, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has written to key legal and arbitration professional bodies in Hong Kong to consult them on the recommendations set out in the Report. The organisations which have responded so far have all indicated their support for the proposed reform. The DoJ has also consulted the Steering Committee on Mediation and the Steering Committee supported the proposed consequential amendments to the Mediation Ordinance.",
            "At the meeting of the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services (Panel) of the Legislative Council (LegCo) held in November last year, I, together with the Chairperson of the Sub-committee, provided a briefing on the proposed reform and the views of the aforementioned stakeholders. The Panel expressed support for the introduction of the Bill into the LegCo.",
            "Main Amendments under the Bill",
            "The Bill proposes that a new Part 10A be added to the Arbitration Ordinance, so as to ensure that third party funding of arbitration is not prohibited by the common law doctrines of maintenance and champerty and to provide for related measures and safeguards. The new Part 10A, which is based on the draft provisions in the LRC Report, contains 6 Divisions. The new Part 10A is intended to come into operation in two stages: Divisions 1, 2, 4 and 6 will commence on the gazettal of the Ordinance, while Divisions 3 and 5 will commence on a date to be appointed. This is to facilitate the preparatory work for the relevant regulatory framework to be done before the provisions clarifying the legal position come into operation.",
            "The Bill also proposes that a new section 7A be added to the Mediation Ordinance so as to extend the application of the new Part 10A of the Arbitration Ordinance to mediation to which the Mediation Ordinance applies and to funding of services provided in Hong Kong for non-Hong Kong mediation.",
            "Under the above proposal, where litigation in court ensued despite the mediation, the doctrines of maintenance and champerty will continue to apply. The doctrines will only be inapplicable to the mediation conducted prior to or during the course of the litigation.",
            "Conclusion",
            "President, the DoJ has been reviewing the dispute resolution regime of Hong Kong from time to time and will also consider improvement to the Arbitration Ordinance and the Mediation Ordinance as and when appropriate, so as to ensure that the latest developments in the dispute resolution sector can be promptly reflected in the relevant legislation. There is undoubtedly a trend to permit third party funding of arbitration in international arbitration. We believe that the Bill, when enacted, will further enhance Hong Kong's position as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region.",
            "With these remarks, I urge Members to support the Bill.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（一月十一日）在立法會會議上動議二讀《2016年仲裁及調解法例（第三者資助）（修訂）條例草案》的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "主席︰",
            "我謹動議二讀《2016年仲裁及調解法例（第三者資助）（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。《條例草案》的主要目的，是修訂香港法例第609章《仲裁條例》和第620章《調解條例》，以釐清香港法律准許第三者資助仲裁、調解及相關法律程序。",
            "建議的修訂是根據香港法律改革委員會（法改會）於二○一六年十月發表的《第三方資助仲裁》報告書（《報告書》）內的建議，以及調解督導委員會的意見制訂。",
            "香港法律是否准許第三者資助仲裁",
            "政府的一貫政策，是推廣香港作為亞太區主要的國際法律及爭議解決服務中心。近年，第三者資助仲裁及其他爭議解決程序在多個司法管轄區日益普遍，當中包括澳大利亞、英格蘭及威爾斯、歐洲多個司法管轄區及美國。目前，採用第三者資助安排的原因，通常是因為受資助方缺乏財務資源，無法透過訴訟程序提出自己的申索。然而，越來越多當事人即使具備財務資源參與有關的訴訟程序，也會要求第三者資助作為財務或風險管理工具。",
            "香港是主要亞太區國際仲裁中心之一。如果香港法例明確准許第三者資助仲裁，參與在香港進行仲裁的當事人，很可能會考慮應否尋求第三者資助。",
            "香港的法院原則上並不反對第三者資助仲裁及相關法律程序（包括調解）。然而，助訟及包攬訴訟的普通法原則是否也適用於在香港進行的第三者資助仲裁，現時的情況並不清晰。實際上，終審法院在二○○七年頒下的一項判決中明言對這個問題未下定論（註）。由於現時不能確定香港法律是否准許在香港進行第三者資助仲裁，這可能會影響香港作為仲裁地點的吸引力，並且影響香港作為處理跨境投資及商業爭議的仲裁中心的競爭力。",
            "法律改革委員會的檢討與建議",
            "基於以上背景，本人聯同終審法院首席法官於二○一三年六月委託法改會成立小組委員會，檢討第三者資助仲裁的情况，以便考慮是否需要進行改革。二○一五年十月，該小組委員會發表一份諮詢文件，建議香港法律應准許第三者資助在香港進行的仲裁。",
            "法改會在考慮公眾諮詢期內收集的意見書後，於去年十月發表《報告書》。其結論認為需要改革香港的法律，以訂明助訟及包攬訴訟的普通法原則並不妨礙第三者資助《仲裁條例》下的仲裁及相關法律程序。",
            "法改會建議，應規定資助仲裁的出資第三者遵從由根據《仲裁條例》獲授權的機構所發出的《實務守則》，並在該《實務守則》中列明出資第三者在進行有關業務時一般須予遵從（包括財務及專業操守）的標準和實務指引。",
            "此外，法改會建議應考慮是否同時對《調解條例》作出相應修訂，把上述的建議延伸至《調解條例》適用範圍內的調解。",
            "政府對《報告書》的回應",
            "政府認為，從推廣香港作為國際爭議解決中心的角度及為釐清法律，均值得推行擬議的法律改革。此舉將對香港作為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心之一，能跟上最新的國際發展，及加強競爭地位尤其重要。",
            "諮詢",
            "在《報告書》發表後，律政司就《報告書》的建議去信諮詢香港主要的法律及仲裁專業團體。已回覆的團體均對上述的建議改革表示支持。律政司亦就《調解條例》中引入相應修訂的建議諮詢調解督導委員會。該委員會對建議的修訂表示支持。",
            "本人及小組委員會主席於去年11月的立法會司法及法律事務委員會(事務委員會)會議上，就建議的修訂及上述持份者的意見作出簡介。事務委員會對提交《條例草案》表示支持。",
            "《條例草案》的主要修訂",
            "《條例草案》建議在《仲裁條例》加入新的第10A部，以確保第三者資助仲裁不受助訟及包攬訴訟的普通法法則禁止，並制定相關措施及保障。新的第10A部是建基於《報告書》中的條文擬稿，並載有6個分部。新的第10A部擬分兩階段實施：第1、2、4及6分部將於條例刊憲當日生效；而第3及5分部則將於另行指定的日期生效。此舉是為了方便於澄清法律情況的條文實施之前，進行相關規管框架的準備工作。",
            "《條例草案》亦建議在《調解條例》加入新的第7A條，將《仲裁條例》新的第10A部引申，使其適用於《調解條例》適用的調解，以及就資助香港以外進行的調解，而在香港提供的服務。",
            "根據上述建議，若進行調解後當事人各方仍以法院訴訟解決有關爭議的話，助訟及包攬訴訟原則仍繼續適用於該法院訴訟。助訟及包攬訴訟原則只是不適用於在訴訟展開前或審理期間進行的調解。",
            "結語",
            "主席，律政司不時檢討香港的爭議解決制度，亦會適時考慮對《仲裁條例》及《調解條例》作出改進，以確保相關法例能迅速反映爭議解決業界的最新發展。毫無疑問，准許第三者資助仲裁是國際仲裁的大趨勢。我們相信，《條例草案》獲得通過後，能進一步鞏固香港作為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。",
            "我謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持《條例草案》。",
            "多謝主席。",

            "根據上述建議，若進行調解後當事人各方仍以法院訴訟解決有關爭議的話，助訟及包攬訴訟原則仍繼續適用於該法院訴訟",
