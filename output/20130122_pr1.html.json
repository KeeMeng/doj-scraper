            "Following is the English translation of the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services of the Legislative Council today (January 22):",
            "Chairman and Members,",
            "The key policy directions and work plan of the Department of Justice (DoJ) for the year ahead are set out in our paper submitted to this Panel on January 16. I will not repeat them here, but will only highlight the key aspects.",
            "Our Vision",
            "The vision of DoJ is to uphold the rule of law, judicial independence and fundamental human rights in accordance with the Basic Law, and to enhance our legal system and legal infrastructure. As always, we will in accordance with this vision take forward various aspects of our work, including providing professional and independent legal advice to government bureaux and departments, representing Government in Courts, providing prosecution service which is fair and just, drafting legislation, as well as promoting and strengthening Hong Kong as a regional centre for legal services and dispute resolution.",
            "Developing Hong Kong's Legal, Arbitration and Mediation Services",
            "In support of the policy of developing Hong Kong's business and professional services announced by the Chief Executive in his Policy Address (paragraphs 38-39), we will pursue various new initiatives in 2013 to further enhance our position as a legal services hub and a centre for dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to continuing previous promotion works, we will focus on three aspects so as to achieve our objectives:",
            "Firstly, we will actively liaise and work with the relevant Mainland authorities or bodies, as well as the legal profession, arbitration and mediation institutions in Hong Kong, to facilitate Hong Kong professionals in these areas to provide legal, arbitration and mediation services in Qianhai, Shenzhen, and Nansha, Guangdong. Our main objectives include promoting the use of Hong Kong law in contracts concluded by enterprises conducting business in Qianhai and Nansha; the choice of Hong Kong as an ideal arbitration and dispute resolution venue for commercial disputes; and the implementation of the initiative to establish association in the form of partnership between Hong Kong and Mainland law firms. We will also work closely with the relevant stakeholders of both sides in order to facilitate the implementation of liberalised measures in respect of legal, arbitration and mediation services by Hong Kong professionals and institutions in Qianhai and Nansha.",
            "Secondly, we will further foster the development of mediation services in Hong Kong through the newly established Steering Committee on Mediation. We have submitted a paper under the next item on the agenda of this meeting, explaining in detail what we have achieved so far in the area of mediation and the way forward, which include monitoring the implementation of the Mediation Ordinance, the development of accreditation of mediators, and the promotion and publicity of mediation, etc. As such, I will not go into the details here. Besides, we have also submitted a discussion paper to explain our proposal to create a dedicated Deputy Principal Government Counsel post for two years with a view to taking forward effectively and comprehensively this area of work. I would wish to appeal to Members to support the proposal so that we can have the required manpower for taking forward the development of mediation services in Hong Kong.",
            "Thirdly, we will allocate office space in the West Wing of the former Central Government Offices for use by legal, arbitration and mediation institutions to facilitate them to develop their services in Hong Kong. The preliminary preparation for the West Wing project is now underway. We will assess the actual area available, and will study in detail the factors that should be taken into account regarding the use of the West Wing by these institutions as well as other related issues.",
            "Furthermore, we will continue to enhance legal co-operation in civil and commercial matters between Hong Kong and other jurisdictions including the Mainland, so as to facilitate the resolution of civil and commercial disputes in a more convenient and effective manner. This will include enhancing legal co-operation with Guangdong pursuant to the Framework Agreement on Hong Kong/Guangdong Co-operation.",
            "Prosecution Work",
            "As I have pointed out at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2013, it is our goal to provide a modern, progressive, efficient and fair prosecutions service. Enhancing the capability and effectiveness of the Prosecutions Division in the conduct of legal proceedings will also be our focus in the coming year. Over the past few years, the Prosecutions Division has implemented various measures to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. They include improving the efficiency of the advisory function of the Prosecutions Division, providing continuous training for prosecutors, as well as the implementation of the Joint Training Programme with the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong for newly qualified lawyers.",
            "We will implement various initiatives in the coming year to further enhance the capability and effectiveness of our prosecutions service in the conduct of criminal proceedings, namely:",
            "(a) reviewing and where necessary updating the Statement of Prosecution Policy and Practice;",
            "(b) establishing coordinators or specific units for handling particular types of cases, so that these cases can be handled more effectively and efficiently;",
            "(c) identifying areas of the criminal justice system which may require further examination and considering whether they should be reformed, so that our criminal justice system can better meet the expectations of the community;",
            "(d) enhancing and expanding our capability in the recovery of proceeds of crime.",
            "Law Drafting",
            "As to law drafting work, we will endeavour to ensure legislation that implements Government policy is drafted on time in clear and plain language (for both the English and Chinese texts) and is published in a manner that is easy to read and access. In the coming year, we will continue to make legislation more accessible through timely issue of guidelines. We will press ahead with the establishment of an electronic database of Hong Kong legislation with legal status. We will continue to properly exercise the editorial and revision powers introduced by the Legislation Publication Ordinance to amend the statute book so as to gradually bring previously enacted legislation into conformity with the current format style and drafting practices.",
            "Legislative Work",
            "We will also take forward a number of new legislative proposals in the coming year, including the following:",
            "(a) We will introduce amendments to the Arbitration Ordinance to give effect to the arrangement concerning reciprocal enforcement of arbitral awards concluded between Hong Kong and Macao in January 2013. We will also take the opportunity to work in collaboration with the arbitration sector to make further improvement to the Arbitration Ordinance.",
            "(b) We will introduce the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill to the Legislative Council in the second half of the 2013 legislative session to implement the recommendations put forth in the Law Reform Commission (LRC) report on \"Privity of Contract\" published in September 2005.",
            "(c) We will work with the Hong Kong Society of Notaries on a legislative proposal to facilitate the admission in civil proceedings of notarial acts or instruments duly executed by notaries public registered in Hong Kong. We will consult the Panel on this legislative proposal.",
            "Working Group on Class Action",
            "Lastly, I would like to mention that the DoJ has set up a cross-sector working group to study and consider the proposals in the LRC report on \"Class Actions\" published in May 2012. Recommendations will be made to the Administration on the way forward.",
            "I hope the above explanation can enhance Members' understanding of our work in the coming year. My DoJ colleagues and I are happy to take any questions from Members. Thank you.",

            "主席、各位委員：",
            "律政司的主要政策方向及我們在未來一年將推展的工作，已經在我們於一月十六日向本委員會提交的文件中陳述。我在此不再重複，只會向大家簡述當中的重點。",
            "律政司工作的理念，是根據《基本法》致力維護法治、司法獨立和基本人權，並會優化香港的法律制度及法律建設。我們會一如既往，按此理念推展律政司各方面的工作，包括向政府各決策局和部門提供專業及獨立的法律意見、代表政府出庭訟辯、提供公平、公正的檢控服務、擬備法例，及推廣和強化香港作為區域性的法律服務和解決爭議中心。",
            "為配合行政長官在本年《施政報告》（第三十八至三十九段）提出有關發展香港工商及專業服務的政策，我們會在二○一三年推行多項新措施，以進一步提升香港作為亞太區法律服務樞紐以及解決爭議中心的地位。除繼續以往的推廣工作，我們會特別從三方面着手，以達致有關目標：",
            "第一，我們會積極與內地相關部委或機構，及香港法律專業和仲裁及調解機構聯絡及合作，利便香港法律、仲裁及調解專業人員在深圳前海及廣東南沙提供法律、仲裁和調解服務。我們的主要目標包括：推動在前海和南沙營商的企業所簽訂的合約中採用香港法律；推廣選擇以香港作為就商事糾紛進行仲裁及解決爭議的理想地點；以及落實香港與內地律師事務所以合夥模式聯營的措施。我們亦會與兩地的相關持份者緊密合作，以利便實施就香港專業人員和機構在前海和南沙提供法律、仲裁和調解服務的開放措施。",
            "第二，我們會通過新成立的調解督導委員會（督導委員會），進一步推動香港調解服務的發展。我們已經提交文件，在本會議下一個議程中向大家詳細解釋我們在調解範疇現階段的工作成果，以及未來路向，包括監察《調解條例》的實施，調解員資格的評審的發展，以及提倡宣傳和推廣工作等，我在此不再詳述。此外，我們亦提交了討論文件，解釋我們開設一個為期兩年的副首席政府律師的專責職位的建議，希望從而能有效地全面推進有關工作。希望各委員能支持有關建議，讓我們可以有所需人手，推展香港調解服務的發展。",
            "第三，我們會在前中區政府合署西座撥出辦公地方，供法律、仲裁及調解的機構使用，以協助這些機構在香港發展有關服務。西座工程的前期籌備工作現正進行，我們會評估實際可提供的面積，並將詳細研究有關機構使用西座時應考慮的因素及其他相關事宜。",
            "此外，我們會繼續加強香港與內地等其他司法管轄區在民商事方面的法律合作，促使民商事爭議能以更方便及有效的方法解決，包括依據《粵港合作框架協議》加強與廣東省的法律合作。",
            "正如我在二○一三法律年度開啟典禮時指出，我們的目標是提供現代化、進取、高效率和公平的刑事檢控服務。加強刑事檢控科進行法律程序的能力和效益，亦是我們來年的工作重點。在過去幾年間，刑事檢控科已實施了多項措施，以提升效率和成效：其中包括提高刑事檢控科在提供法律指引方面的工作效率，為檢控人員提供持續培訓及與香港大律師公會及香港律師會合作為新近取得資格的律師合辦的聯合培訓計劃等。",
            "我們會在來年實施不同措施，以進一步加強檢控機構進行刑事法律程序的能力和效益，當中包括：",
            "（一）檢討及有需要時更新《檢控政策及常規》；",
            "（二）設立協調人員或特定組別，處理指定類別的案件，從而更有效、更快捷處理有關案件；",
            "（三）找出刑事法律制度須進一步研究的範疇，以考慮應否進行改革，使我們的刑事司法制度更切合社會的期望；",
            "（四）加強和提升我們在追討犯罪得益方面的能力。",
            "在法律草擬工作方面，我們會致力確保落實政府施政的法例能依時擬備，行文（無論是英文或中文）清晰易明，而發布方式會便於閱覽及使用。來年我們會繼續適時發布關於法例草擬的指引，使法例更易於理解。我們會全力推展建立具有法定地位的香港法例電子資料庫的工作。我們會繼續妥善行使《法例發布條例》所引進的編輯和修訂權力，修訂法例文本，逐步令過去制定的法例符合現行的版面格式和草擬慣例。",
            "我們亦會於來年推展多項新的立法建議，包括︰",
            "（一）修訂《仲裁條例》的法案，以實施香港與澳門於二○一三年一月簽訂就相互執行仲裁裁決的有關安排，我們亦會借此機會與仲裁業合作，進一步改善《仲裁條例》。",
            "（二）在二○一三年立法會會期的下半年向立法會提交《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》，以落實法改會二○○五年九月發表的《立約各方的相互關係報告書》的建議。",
            "（三）與香港國際公證人協會合作制訂一項立法建議，以利便在民事法律程序中接納在香港註冊的公證人妥為執行的公證作為或妥為簽立的文書。我們會就這項立法建議徵詢事務委員會的意見。",
            "最後一提，律政司已成立跨界別的工作小組，負責研究和考慮法改會在二○一二年五月發表《集體訴訟》報告書的建議，並就未來發展路向向當局提出建議。",
            "我希望剛才的介紹，可以加深各委員對律政司來年工作的認識。各委員如有問題，我和律政司的同事樂意解答。謝謝！",
