            "The Chief Executive, Mr C Y Leung; the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mrs Carrie Lam; the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC; the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Raymond Tam; and the Under Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Lau Kong-wah, today (July 15) held a press conference on the Report by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on whether there is a need to amend the methods for selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2017 and for forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2016 and the Report on the Public Consultation on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016at the Auditorium, Central Government Offices, Tamar. Following is the transcript of the question-and-answer session at the press conference:",
            "Reporter: Mr Chief Executive, you described this proposal as an invitation for the Chinese Government to create a new policy for the election, but in recent months we've seen quite a bit of consternation from Beijing regarding the pulse of democracy in Hong Kong, most recently the White Paper. While the document we have in front of us is all good and well and does, as you've said, reflect the views of those in Hong Kong, what makes you believe that authorities in Beijing are in fact going to say \"OK, we endorse this push for democracy\", given the recent hostility we've heard?",
            "Chief Executive: Thank you for your question. Let me take you back a little bit into history. In the Joint Declaration signed between the Chinese Government and the United Kingdom Government in 1984 on the question of Hong Kong, the provision regarding the appointment of the Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive – this was 1984 – was this: the Chief Executive shall be appointed on the basis of consultation or election held locally. The keywords: \"consultation or election held locally\". It didn't say anywhere in the Joint Declaration between the two governments that election of the Chief Executive shall be by way of universal suffrage. And that's why, for the past four elections of the Chief Executive, we had electoral college elections, and these elections were in compliance with this provision in the Joint Declaration. And this was 1984. But then, in 1990, the Basic Law, and the Basic Law is a Chinese national law and the law of the Hong Kong SAR, said that the universal suffrage was our ultimate aim, so it wasn't by way of agreement between the Chinese Government and the United Kingdom Government that we have a promise of universal suffrage. It was actually in the 1990 Basic Law that we have a promise of universal suffrage, and that's why we are here and that's why we are moving towards this ultimate goal. And this will be, as I have said in my opening remarks, this will be historic for Hong Kong: the fact that Hong Kong, after 150, 160 years, will have the first Chief Executive appointed on the basis of universal suffrage or direct election held in Hong Kong. It has been all along a Chinese Government undertaking and not by way of international agreement or international arrangement.",
            "So I have no doubt in my mind, and the Chinese Central Authorities have repeatedly said in the past year or so that they are fully committed. They are as fully committed as I am, as head of the Hong Kong SAR Government, as the Hong Kong SAR Government at large and also as the entire Hong Kong community are, committed to this goal. And this is why we need to seize this historical opportunity, and that's why I said if we could set aside some of our differences and if we could all take this big stride towards the common goal of universal suffrage, it would be a great thing for Hong Kong.",
            "Reporter: Mr Chief Executive, in your report you didn't mention anything ... but you pretty much ruled out \"civil nomination\" and amending the 2016 LegCo election. Are you disregarding the huge numbers of people who came out specifically to demand this? Thank you.",
            "Chief Executive: Well, we haven't ruled out anything in the two reports. The essence of my report as Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR to the NPCSC (Standing Committee of the National People's Congress) is to say that I believe that the method for electing the Chief Executive in 2017 should be amended, and that's the essence of my report. And the purpose of the other report, and this is the consultation report, is to collect and reflect comprehensively and truthfully all the views and proposals expressed in Hong Kong during the consultation period. So while we have views about whether \"civic nomination\" is in compliance with the provision of the Basic Law, and the Secretary for Justice has elaborated on that, we do not make choices in this exercise.",
            "Chief Executive: Let's have the last question in English, shall we?",
            "Reporter: Mr Leung, in paragraph 14 of your report, you said that some legal professionals have pointed out that the \"civic nomination\" did not comply with the Basic Law. But the Bar Association last week also said that the Government should not reject popular proposals outright and should try to explore if the proposals' rationale could be accommodated by alternative methods that are compatible with the Basic Law. You said just now that you have reflected the views expressed in the unofficial \"referendum\" and the July 1st rally to Beijing. But why are these views actually not included in your report submitted to the Central Authorities? Thank you.",
            "Chief Executive: What's the relationship between your question and what you said about the Bar Association?",
            "Reporter: The point being that you actually did not put the recommendations and the views expressed by the Bar Association and the referendum in your report submitted. Why did you actually ...?",
            "Chief Executive: I am getting a bit confused. Let me try to surmise what you wanted to ask. The consultation report is actually very comprehensive and it truthfully reflects the views collected in the community during the consultation period. The two legal professions' views are also included. They are actually in the consultation report. On the question of the views expressed by people who took part in the rally and also the so-called \"civic poll\", the \"referendum\", I said in my opening address that I did reflect the views expressed by these people to the Central Authorities there and then.",
            "Reporter: Regarding the formation of the Legislative Council, how do you expect Legislature and Administration's relationship to improve if you don't make any changes? Is this your way of controlling the future development of constitutional reform in Hong Kong by not amending the formation of the Legislative Council?",
            "Chief Executive: Amending the formation of the Legislative Council? Could I ask the Secretary ...?",
            "Chief Secretary for Administration: As far as Annex II to Basic Law is concerned, in so far as the formation of Legislative Council, there are only two main ingredients. One is the total number of Legislative Council Members; the other is the split between the geographically directly elected members and the functional constituency members. I doubt very much that in the current situation by increasing the number of Legislative Council Members or by sort of changing the split between the geographically elected members as well as the functional constituency members could guarantee an improvement in the working relationship between the Executive and Legislature. And, to be very fair to the Executive, some of the problems that we have seen recently arise from the so-called Rules of Procedures of the Legislative Council in terms of filibustering, in terms of calling for quorum and so on. But having said that, I, on behalf of the Administration, will try to engage and discuss with the Legislative Council Members so that when the session resumes later this year, we will be able to find better arrangements to serve the people of Hong Kong.",
            "Chief Executive: First of all, I said when I was in the Legislative Council a couple of weeks ago, answering the question posed to me by the Honourable Tommy Cheung, I said there and then that I very much welcome any suggestion as to how we could improve on the relationship between the Executive, which is the Government, and the Legislative Council. And straight after that session, I asked my office to get in touch with the Honourable Tommy Cheung, and my colleagues, my senior colleagues, had a meeting with him. So, we are open to suggestions. But if I could fold your question into the subject today, which is the amendment of the method of electing the Chief Executive, let me just remind everyone in Hong Kong that we have a very high threshold. We need two-thirds majority of LegCo. Now whether it is this Legislature in Hong Kong or Legislatures in other jurisdictions, requiring a two-thirds majority, particularly when you do not have a majority party, a single majority party, is a very high threshold. So it is going to be a challenge. But I, myself, my colleagues in the SAR Government and the leaders of the country, including the NPCSC, are all committed to achieving this goal on time, so that we have \"one man, one vote\" universal suffrage election of the Chief Executive in 2017, and we are committed. Thank you.",

            "行政長官梁振英、政務司司長林鄭月娥、律政司司長袁國強資深大律師、政制及內地事務局局長譚志源及政制及內地事務局副局長劉江華今日（七月十五日）下午在添馬政府總部演講廳就行政長官提交全國人大常委會報告及《二零一七年行政長官及二零一六年立法會產生辦法公眾諮詢報告》舉行記者會。以下是記者會的答問全文：",
            "記者：梁生你好，想問一問，其實你們都很強調這個普選方案要符合《基本法》，但是為甚麼你提交上北京這份報告裏，其實沒有明確就「公民提名」是否合法去表態，可不可以說說其實政府立場對「公民提名」的態度如何？以及日後提出的方案其實是否不會包含「公民提名」呢？謝謝。",
            "行政長官：有關對《基本法》的理解和「公民提名」之間的關係，我稍後請律政司司長說一下。就今日這兩份報告的基本性質是甚麼呢？諮詢報告當然就過去幾個月諮詢期內我們收集到的意見作一個歸納，而且附錄是巨細無遺地向全社會公開，亦向全國人大常委會作出報告。而我作為行政長官的那份報告，主要是指出二○一七年行政長官的產生辦法是需要修改，當然亦撮錄了諮詢報告裏面一些在諮詢期間收到的意見。今次我們這兩個報告的目的，並不是去選擇一些社會上我們收集到的建議或者意見，亦不是就一些社會上有不同看法，對《基本法》和人大決定的演繹作出一些判斷。但是既然何小姐你問到那個問題，我請律政司司長答一答。",
            "律政司司長：正如行政長官剛才所說，這個諮詢報告的目的是如實反映我們在五個月的諮詢期內所搜集到的意見，當然亦有包括「公民提名」的意見。整體來說，我們的立場正如以往我重申一樣，除了政治層面和運作層面，我們亦須考慮《基本法》和相關人大常委的決定和解釋。任何可能會令提名委員會專屬的提名權被繞過或削弱，都難以符合《基本法》，這是我們一向的立場，亦在今次的諮詢文件裏反映。至於往後的具體方案如何，我相信首先要看看八月底如果人大作出決定後，以及往後我們會與社會上不同團體溝通後，特區政府會推出我們的方案，到時大家可以再討論。",
            "記者：想請問剛才CY你都說要如實去反映民意，為甚麼報告內沒提及79萬的「公民投票」和沒提到七一上街50萬市民，以及亦沒提到當晚有這麼多市民在街上靜坐留守，希望政府可以將「公民提名」的意見加入二○一七年，為甚麼有這樣一個情況出現？是否選擇性地去接收和反映民意呢？以及想問裏面沒寫到79萬（人），但有一個主流意見說：提名權只是給予提委會，主流意見從哪裏來？即是你將沉默大多數市民的意願借來用，或其實加了水分？謝謝。",
            "行政長官：諮詢報告的內容請政務司司長答。",
            "政務司司長：好。",
            "記者：但我的問題是問CY，CY你可否答？",
            "行政長官：諮詢報告的內容請政務司司長答。",
            "記者：CY剛才的問題是問你，可否由你答？",
            "政務司司長：或者我先講解一下，好嗎？因為在立法會剛才不少議員都有近似提問。我們是客觀、持平、如實歸納地去寫這個諮詢報告，這個諮詢報告是要記錄在五個月的諮詢期裏面我們聽到、收到的意見。所以，去到五月三日之後，在社會上再有很多市民用其他不同的途徑來發表意見，或有更加多的民意調查來發表其結果，我們都是沒放入這個諮詢報告裏面，這個所以是一個客觀的做法。但我們都明白到我們今日公布諮詢報告和行政長官提交給全國人大常委會的報告時，大家都會有這個問題。所以，你可以見得到在行政長官提交給全國人大常委會的報告裏面，他亦在第十三、第十四段有講到在諮詢期結束之後，亦有市民繼續用不同的方法來表達意見，而不少市民亦表達了希望有「公民提名」的元素放在日後方案方面。但當然，我們亦有責任同時間提出所有方案往後亦要符合《基本法》和全國人大常委會的規定。而在諮詢期內，我們都聽到不少本地、內地的法律專家的意見，就是「公民提名」是難以符合到《基本法》裏面四十五條，只是給提名委員會有專屬的提名權這個安排。",
            "記者：CY，我剛才是問你，你可否講講對這些意見的看法？",
            "行政長官：我剛才在開場發言時我已經說了，我們今次的工作尤其是行政長官那部分的工作，就是向人大常委會提出行政長官二○一七年產生辦法有需要修改，諮詢報告是囊括在諮詢期間大家提交的意見，我在發言期間亦有講七月一日那次遊行，以及我們即時已向中央反映了。",
            "記者：想問一下，因為兩份報告都出現很多字眼，就是「普遍認同」、「主流意見指」。其實這樣，如果是這樣看的話，諮詢報告雖然附錄是有齊所有意見，但是作出整合的時候，會否說出有多少比重，哪些市民是支持有「公民提名」，又或者哪些市民是覺得應該要符合《基本法》呢？即是可否在字眼上解釋多一些，為甚麼會引用「普遍認同」和「主流意見」，而不是確實說出有多少人支持？而另外都想說關於遊行和投票，其實人數是比較大的，為甚麼不可以將那一個細則寫在報告內，將這些都交給人大常委看呢？",
            "行政長官：請譚志源局長。",
            "政制及內地事務局局長：多謝你的問題。我們在諮詢報告的處理與上兩次的政改諮詢的處理一樣，即是說我們不會進行一個量化的方式。這個在我們五個月諮詢期開始時的第一場公開活動已說明了，在我們的報告內亦有說明，我們做的是一個整體的歸納和整理。在個別的情況，如果有數字的量化，特別是民意調查方面，我們在諮詢報告內都有比較大的篇幅列舉出相關的民調數字。我們也根據二百多場的諮詢會和座談會所收到的意見，大部分這些諮詢會和座談會其實也是公開的，大家傳媒也有採訪，我也見過在場很多傳媒朋友在場。另外，我們那十多萬份的書面意見，今日大家上網都會看到，所以這些其實都給予了大家原材料，去參考我們一個整體的描述。",
            "我們所說的字眼都是一些qualitative，即是描述性的字眼，並不是一個quantitative analysis。我們認為政改這麼複雜的議題，純粹用簡單的數字去分，未必是對提交意見的朋友或團體公道。你看到我們諮詢報告內提到，特別是提名程序內，其實市民大眾的意見是多元化的，而且有不少市民覺得最理想的方式可以是某一個形式，但若較沒有那麼理想但他可以接受時，可能在另外一些民意調查或意見上他都會表達出來，所以在這麼複雜和多元的意見內，我們覺得現在的整理和歸納是比較適當，這也和我們以往的處理相若。",
            "記者：想問問，有不少意見都認為其實政改的底線，即是普選的底線是要符合國際標準。政府推出方案時，其實這個會否是一個你們考慮的一點？第二，就是想問二○一六（年）的立法會選舉，因為《基本法》都說過，政改是要循序漸進，現在不作修改，其實是否為了保留功能組別去鋪路？",
            "行政長官：我們在社會上收集到的意見，無論那些意見是否被認為是符合國際標準，或者他提出，他只是說國際標準，但沒有說這個國際標準是甚麼東西，我們都全部把它歸納，以及採納在我們的附錄內。但最重要的是甚麼呢？就是如果國際標準是不符合《基本法》的話，或者人大常委（會）有關的決定的話，我們都是要跟《基本法》和人大常委（會）的規定和決定。至於立法會的問題，我請局長，請你回答一下。",
            "政制及內地事務局局長：在立法會方面，我們的理解是《基本法》第六十八條要全面普選（立法會）的時空，是根據二○○七年十二月二十九日的全國人大常委會的決定，我們先落實普選行政長官，繼而處理全部（立法會）議席以普選產生。因為二○一六年很明顯未到二○一七年普選行政長官，故此二○一六年是不會實行全面（立法會）議席由普選產生，但不代表二○一六年的立法會產生辦法整體來說不作任何改變。因為我們看《基本法》附件二，在憲制層面所規定的只是兩樣事情，第一就是立法會的議席數目，第二就是議席數目的分布比例，這兩個是涉及（立法會）產生辦法。但我們在諮詢期所收到的很多其他意見，大部分（可以）在本地立法的層面處理。綜合來說有三方面，第一，地區直選選區的大小和數目，及議席數目的上下限，這個（由）本地立法來處理；第二，現行功能組別的選民基礎，是否需要進一步擴大呢？我們在諮詢期亦收到這方面的意見，包括有些團體票（是否）可以變個人票，或某些功能界別是否可以多些開放給一些個人從業員等；第三，在功能組別的組合及整合方面，我們收到的部分意見書都有提及，例如，現行的五席「超級議席」是否可以減少或增加一點呢？這兩方面的意見我們都有收到。總的來說，在本地立法層面，我們會繼續諮詢立法會和社會各界的意見。特別在本地立法方面，若要修改時，我們要提一個條例修訂草案到立法會，這個工作我們會繼續做。",

            "記者：梁生你好，想問一問，其實你們都很強調這個普選方案要符合《基本法》，但是為甚麼你提交上北京這份報告裏，其實沒有明確就「公民提名」是否合法去表態，可不可以說說其實政府立場對「公民提名」的態度如何？以及日後提出的方案其實是否不會包含「公民提名」呢？謝謝",
            "行政長官：有關對《基本法》的理解和「公民提名」之間的關係，我稍後請律政司司長說一下",
            "就今日這兩份報告的基本性質是甚麼呢？諮詢報告當然就過去幾個月諮詢期內我們收集到的意見作一個歸納，而且附錄是巨細無遺地向全社會公開，亦向全國人大常委會作出報告",
            "而我作為行政長官的那份報告，主要是指出二○一七年行政長官的產生辦法是需要修改，當然亦撮錄了諮詢報告裏面一些在諮詢期間收到的意見",
            "今次我們這兩個報告的目的，並不是去選擇一些社會上我們收集到的建議或者意見，亦不是就一些社會上有不同看法，對《基本法》和人大決定的演繹作出一些判斷",
            "但是既然何小姐你問到那個問題，我請律政司司長答一答",
            "律政司司長：正如行政長官剛才所說，這個諮詢報告的目的是如實反映我們在五個月的諮詢期內所搜集到的意見，當然亦有包括「公民提名」的意見",
            "整體來說，我們的立場正如以往我重申一樣，除了政治層面和運作層面，我們亦須考慮《基本法》和相關人大常委的決定和解釋",
            "任何可能會令提名委員會專屬的提名權被繞過或削弱，都難以符合《基本法》，這是我們一向的立場，亦在今次的諮詢文件裏反映",
            "至於往後的具體方案如何，我相信首先要看看八月底如果人大作出決定後，以及往後我們會與社會上不同團體溝通後，特區政府會推出我們的方案，到時大家可以再討論",
            "記者：想請問剛才CY你都說要如實去反映民意，為甚麼報告內沒提及79萬的「公民投票」和沒提到七一上街50萬市民，以及亦沒提到當晚有這麼多市民在街上靜坐留守，希望政府可以將「公民提名」的意見加入二○一七年，為甚麼有這樣一個情況出現？是否選擇性地去接收和反映民意呢？以及想問裏面沒寫到79萬（人），但有一個主流意見說：提名權只是給予提委會，主流意見從哪裏來？即是你將沉默大多數市民的意願借來用，或其實加了水分？謝謝",
            "行政長官：諮詢報告的內容請政務司司長答",
            "政務司司長：好",
            "記者：但我的問題是問CY，CY你可否答？",
            "行政長官：諮詢報告的內容請政務司司長答",
            "記者：CY剛才的問題是問你，可否由你答？",
            "政務司司長：或者我先講解一下，好嗎？因為在立法會剛才不少議員都有近似提問",
            "我們是客觀、持平、如實歸納地去寫這個諮詢報告，這個諮詢報告是要記錄在五個月的諮詢期裏面我們聽到、收到的意見",
            "所以，去到五月三日之後，在社會上再有很多市民用其他不同的途徑來發表意見，或有更加多的民意調查來發表其結果，我們都是沒放入這個諮詢報告裏面，這個所以是一個客觀的做法",
            "但我們都明白到我們今日公布諮詢報告和行政長官提交給全國人大常委會的報告時，大家都會有這個問題",
            "所以，你可以見得到在行政長官提交給全國人大常委會的報告裏面，他亦在第十三、第十四段有講到在諮詢期結束之後，亦有市民繼續用不同的方法來表達意見，而不少市民亦表達了希望有「公民提名」的元素放在日後方案方面",
            "但當然，我們亦有責任同時間提出所有方案往後亦要符合《基本法》和全國人大常委會的規定",
            "而在諮詢期內，我們都聽到不少本地、內地的法律專家的意見，就是「公民提名」是難以符合到《基本法》裏面四十五條，只是給提名委員會有專屬的提名權這個安排",
            "記者：CY，我剛才是問你，你可否講講對這些意見的看法？",
            "行政長官：我剛才在開場發言時我已經說了，我們今次的工作尤其是行政長官那部分的工作，就是向人大常委會提出行政長官二○一七年產生辦法有需要修改，諮詢報告是囊括在諮詢期間大家提交的意見，我在發言期間亦有講七月一日那次遊行，以及我們即時已向中央反映了",
            "記者：想問一下，因為兩份報告都出現很多字眼，就是「普遍認同」、「主流意見指」",
            "其實這樣，如果是這樣看的話，諮詢報告雖然附錄是有齊所有意見，但是作出整合的時候，會否說出有多少比重，哪些市民是支持有「公民提名」，又或者哪些市民是覺得應該要符合《基本法》呢？即是可否在字眼上解釋多一些，為甚麼會引用「普遍認同」和「主流意見」，而不是確實說出有多少人支持？而另外都想說關於遊行和投票，其實人數是比較大的，為甚麼不可以將那一個細則寫在報告內，將這些都交給人大常委看呢？",
            "行政長官：請譚志源局長",
            "政制及內地事務局局長：多謝你的問題",
            "我們在諮詢報告的處理與上兩次的政改諮詢的處理一樣，即是說我們不會進行一個量化的方式",
            "這個在我們五個月諮詢期開始時的第一場公開活動已說明了，在我們的報告內亦有說明，我們做的是一個整體的歸納和整理",
            "在個別的情況，如果有數字的量化，特別是民意調查方面，我們在諮詢報告內都有比較大的篇幅列舉出相關的民調數字",
            "我們也根據二百多場的諮詢會和座談會所收到的意見，大部分這些諮詢會和座談會其實也是公開的，大家傳媒也有採訪，我也見過在場很多傳媒朋友在場",
            "另外，我們那十多萬份的書面意見，今日大家上網都會看到，所以這些其實都給予了大家原材料，去參考我們一個整體的描述",
            "我們認為政改這麼複雜的議題，純粹用簡單的數字去分，未必是對提交意見的朋友或團體公道",
            "你看到我們諮詢報告內提到，特別是提名程序內，其實市民大眾的意見是多元化的，而且有不少市民覺得最理想的方式可以是某一個形式，但若較沒有那麼理想但他可以接受時，可能在另外一些民意調查或意見上他都會表達出來，所以在這麼複雜和多元的意見內，我們覺得現在的整理和歸納是比較適當，這也和我們以往的處理相若",
            "記者：想問問，有不少意見都認為其實政改的底線，即是普選的底線是要符合國際標準",
            "政府推出方案時，其實這個會否是一個你們考慮的一點？第二，就是想問二○一六（年）的立法會選舉，因為《基本法》都說過，政改是要循序漸進，現在不作修改，其實是否為了保留功能組別去鋪路？",
            "行政長官：我們在社會上收集到的意見，無論那些意見是否被認為是符合國際標準，或者他提出，他只是說國際標準，但沒有說這個國際標準是甚麼東西，我們都全部把它歸納，以及採納在我們的附錄內",
            "但最重要的是甚麼呢？就是如果國際標準是不符合《基本法》的話，或者人大常委（會）有關的決定的話，我們都是要跟《基本法》和人大常委（會）的規定和決定",
            "至於立法會的問題，我請局長，請你回答一下",
            "政制及內地事務局局長：在立法會方面，我們的理解是《基本法》第六十八條要全面普選（立法會）的時空，是根據二○○七年十二月二十九日的全國人大常委會的決定，我們先落實普選行政長官，繼而處理全部（立法會）議席以普選產生",
            "因為二○一六年很明顯未到二○一七年普選行政長官，故此二○一六年是不會實行全面（立法會）議席由普選產生，但不代表二○一六年的立法會產生辦法整體來說不作任何改變",
            "因為我們看《基本法》附件二，在憲制層面所規定的只是兩樣事情，第一就是立法會的議席數目，第二就是議席數目的分布比例，這兩個是涉及（立法會）產生辦法",
            "但我們在諮詢期所收到的很多其他意見，大部分（可以）在本地立法的層面處理",
            "綜合來說有三方面，第一，地區直選選區的大小和數目，及議席數目的上下限，這個（由）本地立法來處理；第二，現行功能組別的選民基礎，是否需要進一步擴大呢？我們在諮詢期亦收到這方面的意見，包括有些團體票（是否）可以變個人票，或某些功能界別是否可以多些開放給一些個人從業員等；第三，在功能組別的組合及整合方面，我們收到的部分意見書都有提及，例如，現行的五席「超級議席」是否可以減少或增加一點呢？這兩方面的意見我們都有收到",
            "總的來說，在本地立法層面，我們會繼續諮詢立法會和社會各界的意見",
            "特別在本地立法方面，若要修改時，我們要提一個條例修訂草案到立法會，這個工作我們會繼續做",
            "（待續）",
