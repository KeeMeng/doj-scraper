            "Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (January 20):",
            "Question:",
            "The Law Society of Hong Kong (Law Society) has recently uncovered after an investigation that a former clerk (commonly known as legal executive) of a law firm (firm) dishonestly misappropriated the money of the firm's clients, and the firm allegedly breached the provisions of the Solicitors' Accounts Rules (Cap. 159F), including overdrawing on clients' accounts and allowing unqualified persons to be signatories of clients' accounts. The Law Society has appointed another law firm as the Intervention Agent (Agent) to handle the follow-up work. It has been reported that as the firm was mainly engaged in the business of sale and purchase (S&P) as well as mortgages of second-hand property units, quite a number of property buyers deposited money with the firm. As it takes time for the Agent to handle the follow-up work, such buyers may not be able to engage in time alternative solicitors to take over matters related to their S&P transactions, and get back the transaction money deposited with the firm, resulting in their failure to complete property transactions by the deadlines specified in the S&P agreements, and hence their suffering of huge losses. Besides, as the case may involve criminal offences committed by the partners of the firm, those clients who have suffered losses may not be able to receive compensation through the Solicitors' Professional Indemnity Fund. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it knows the respective numbers of property buyers and sellers affected by the aforesaid case, and the total amount of money involved in the property transactions concerned;",
            "(2) of the measures in place to help expedite the work of the Agent, so that the affected clients may get back the transaction money deposited with the firm as early as possible so that they may complete the transactions in time and avoid huge losses;",
            "(3) whether it has studied the causes of the case, and if there are inadequacies in the relevant regulatory regime and execution work;",
            "(4) of the measures in place to assist those victims who have been unable to complete property transactions due to the aforesaid case in recovering their monetary losses expeditiously; and",
            "(5) as some members of the public have pointed out that the transaction of a second-hand property currently involves the procedures of checking all previous deeds of the property by the solicitors of the buyer and seller to verify the title (and also the preparation of a certified copy of the assignment in case the assignment has been lost), and such procedures are time-consuming and cumbersome, incurring additional transaction costs and indirectly creating opportunities for unscrupulous personnel of law firms to commit offences for gains, whether the Government will expedite the review of such procedures, and implement as soon as possible the Land Titles Ordinance (Cap. 585) which was enacted as early as in 2004, so as to streamline the property conveyancing procedures, and reduce the solicitors' fees payable and the risks to be borne by members of the public in buying and selling properties?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The main purpose of implementing a self-regulatory regime for Hong Kong's legal profession is to ensure the professionalism and independence of Hong Kong legal practitioners. The profession itself is also best placed to respond to the ever-changing landscape of international and local legal practices. This regime is crucial to upholding the rule of law and at the same time maintaining Hong Kong's position as an international legal hub for deal-making and the provision of legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "The Law Society of Hong Kong (Law Society) is the regulatory body of solicitors in Hong Kong and its power and functions are laid down in the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap. 159) and its subsidiary legislation. Amongst others, section 26A of Cap. 159 specifies the circumstances under which the Council of the Law Society (Council) may pass a resolution to exercise its statutory power to intervene into a law firm's practice, including where there is reason to suspect dishonesty on the part of a solicitor or an employee of a solicitor. Upon intervention, the Council may exercise the powers set out in Schedule 2 to Cap. 159, including those relating to the handling of money, documents and mail of that law firm and appointing an intervention agent (IA) to assist in the intervention, for the protection of the interests of the clients of that firm and the public.",
            "With respect to the case mentioned in the question, the Law Society intervened into the practice of the relevant law firm (Intervened Firm) on December 24, 2020. Since then, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has been in contact with the Law Society so as to be apprised of the developments. The Council considered that it had reason to suspect that a former clerk of the Intervened Firm had dishonestly misappropriated clients' money of the Intervened Firm, and was satisfied that there were serious breaches of the regulations of the Solicitors' Accounts Rules (Cap. 159F) by the Intervened Firm, including overdrawing on client accounts and allowing unqualified persons to be authorised signatories of client accounts. Taking into account the seriousness of the findings of the investigation against the Intervened Firm, the Council considered that it had no alternative but to exercise the statutory power pursuant to sections 26A(1)(a)(ii) and 26A(1)(c) of Cap. 159 to intervene into the practice of the Intervened Firm to protect the interests of its clients and the public.",
            "With regard to the question raised by the Hon Paul Tse, the DoJ, having made enquiries with the Law Society and consulted the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, replies as follows:",
            "(1) The DoJ does not have any of the information requested in the question. The Law Society, having been enquired by us, agreed to disclose the following information.",
            "The Law Society indicated that since the Intervened Firm does not have a proper filing system and the physical files located at its head office are very disorganised, it takes time for the IA to acquire a full picture. The exact number of property buyers and sellers affected in the case, as well as the amount of clients' money being involved could only be ascertained after all the information has been obtained, collated and verified.",
            "According to the information gathered by the Law Society as at January 15, 2021, it is estimated that there are around 935 conveyancing matters with imminent deadlines for the period between December 24, 2020 and January 31, 2021.",
            "(2) Section 2 of Schedule 2 to Cap. 159 provides that upon intervention, all sums of money of the Intervened Firm (including all sums of money deposited into the Intervened Firm's client account by its clients) shall vest in the Council and shall be held by the Council on trust for the persons beneficially entitled to them.",
            "We understand that the Council has already appointed five other law firms to assist the IA in order to handle the work related to the intervention as quickly as possible.",
            "According to the Law Society, the urgent tasks for the IA and the assisting law firms at the moment are to locate the files and title deeds from a large number of files, return the files with urgent deadlines to relevant clients, and index the files. As at January 15, 2021, the Intervened Firm's three branch offices in Prince Edward, Tsuen Wan and Yuen Long have already been vacated. The IA is currently processing the remaining files and affairs of the Intervened Firm's head office at Central.",
            "Upon completion of the urgent tasks, the IA plans to launch the claim procedure in February 2021. The IA would need to check the supporting documents with care to verify the claims.",
            "In circumstances where dishonesty is involved or where records of the intervened law firm are incomplete, the release of clients' money has to be subject to authorisation by a court order.",
            "The IA and all the assisting firms are doing their best to handle the process efficiently. The Law Society is also doing what it can within its capacity to provide the necessary manpower support to the IA to facilitate its work. However, given the volume of files and that the records are disorganised, the process would take some time.",
            "(3) The DoJ notes that the Law Society has already explained publicly about the said incident and its statutory powers in the exercise of its regulatory function. As the intervention of the Intervened Firm is still ongoing and involves uncompleted or possible civil or criminal proceedings, it is not appropriate for the DoJ to comment at this stage.",
            "As aforementioned, Hong Kong's legal profession implements a self-regulatory regime to ensure the professionalism and independence of Hong Kong legal practitioners. Cap. 159 and its subsidiary legislation stipulate that the Law Society is the only institution in Hong Kong authorised by law to regulate the professional branch of solicitors. The Law Society must independently exercise its powers and discharge their functions and duties to regulate solicitors in accordance with the relevant enactment.",
            "Where the Council considers that a solicitor or foreign lawyer may be unfit to practise, the Council may, if it considers it necessary for the purpose of investigating the matter, require the solicitor, the foreign lawyer or his/her firm to produce or deliver relevant documents to the Council. The Council may also appoint an inspector under section 8AA(1)(a) of Cap. 159 to conduct an inspection of a law firm on its relevant files, documents and accounting records for the purpose of verifying the firm's compliance with Cap. 159, its subsidiary legislation and other relevant professional conduct rules.",
            "In relation to the power of intervention, according to section 26A(1)(a) of Cap. 159, the Council, before intervening into the practice of a law firm, must consider that the exercise of such statutory power is in the interests of the public or the clients of that firm. The Law Society indicated that, in deciding whether to exercise its statutory power to intervene into the practice of the Intervened Firm, the Council has already taken into account all relevant circumstances and the risks to clients' money being misappropriated. It exercised its statutory power to intervene in order to preserve the clients' money and to protect clients' interests.",
            "The Law Society indicated that it would keep their operation under constant review and is always open to suggestion with a view to improving it.",
            "(4) As pointed out in its press release of January 12, 2021, the Law Society indicated that since the intervention, it has been working closely with different stakeholders to minimise its impact, including:",
            "(a) calling for law firms to assist clients of the Intervened Firm and conducting a briefing session for them on how they could assist;",
            "(b) informing different government bureaux/departments and the Judiciary Administration of the intervention;",
            "(c) updating the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on the intervention and written to the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to urge banks to consider support measures for clients of the Intervened Firm;",
            "(d) alerting the Consumer Council and the Estate Agents Authority of the intervention and urging licensed estate agents who have acted for the clients of the Intervened Firm to consider assistance for them; and",
            "(e) co-ordinating a list of mediators to provide mediation services to parties affected by the intervention and talking to a number of mediation service platforms to seek their assistance.",
            "The HKMA has been closely monitoring the impact on bank customers since it became aware of the incident, and has requested banks to proactively approach affected customers and provide appropriate assistance in a reasonable and accommodating manner. It is understood that banks concerned have already contacted customers who are imminently affected due to the freeze of their mortgage loans and offered assistance as appropriate including financial arrangements. Such include the granting of a mortgage loan of equivalent amount to customers whose mortgage loans have already been disbursed by the bank and yet now frozen, or the provision of an additional bridging loan to customers whose property purchase deposits have been frozen such that the property transactions in question can be completed. Besides, there are also cases involving mortgage refinancing where the new mortgage bank has granted payment holiday for affected customers such that they have time to make arrangements for the original mortgage loans. As cases differ in their circumstances, banks will examine each and every case in order to provide appropriate assistance. The HKMA will continue to communicate with the HKAB and the Law Society with a view to facilitating the offer of suitable protection and assistance to affected bank customers.",
            "Besides, the Stamp Office of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has announced the following arrangements to assist the affected duty payers:",
            "(a) if a duty payer concerned is unable to arrange stamping of a property transaction instrument before the time limit, the Stamp Office will consider remission of penalty for late stamping. The duty payer can make an application to the Stamp Office for remission of penalty directly or through the newly engaged solicitor;",
            "(b) if the duty payer is unable to raise funds to settle the stamp duty payable within a short period of time due to the freezing of relevant bank accounts of the law firm, an application can be made to the Stamp Office for payment by instalment; and",
            "(c) if a property transaction cannot be completed otherwise than by reason of re-sale or disposal of the property by the purchaser, the relevant agreement for sale is not chargeable with stamp duty. The duty payer can apply for refund of the stamp duty paid in respect of the relevant agreement within two years after the agreed date of completion of the transaction.",
            "The IRD issued a press release on the above arrangement on January 12, 2021, and the Stamp Office has also informed the Law Society and is proactively reaching out to its appointed IA and the affected duty payers to assist them in handling the relevant stamp duty matters.",
            "(5) According to the DEVB, the Land Titles Ordinance (Cap. 585) (LTO) aims to establish a new system under which the Title Register will be conclusive evidence as to the title of the property, to replace the present deeds registration system that gives no guarantee to title, with a view to providing greater assurance and certainty to property titles as well as simplifying the procedures of title checking in conveyancing. The Legislative Council (LegCo), when passing the LTO in July 2004, requested the Government to conduct a comprehensive review on a number of outstanding issues and consider making further amendments to the LTO in consultation with the stakeholders before its implementation.",
            "The land title registration system is inherently complicated. It involves complex legal issues and carries significant implications. Since the enactment of the LTO, the Government has carried out a comprehensive review of the LTO in full consultation with the major stakeholders, and put forth various proposals to address stakeholders' divergent views over the main issues, including the mechanism for bringing existing land and properties under the new system (i.e. conversion mechanism) and the rectification and indemnity arrangements. The Government has been making continuous efforts in engaging the major stakeholders, bridging their different expectations and addressing their concerns on implementing the title registration system.",
            "In order to achieve early implementation of the title registration system, the Government is actively pursuing the proposal of implementing title registration on newly granted land first (i.e. land granted by the Government after the commencement of the LTO) (\"new land first\" proposal) and has secured support in principle for the proposal from the major stakeholders. The Government will continue engaging the major stakeholders and strive to reach a consensus on the major issues including indemnity arrangements, verification of applications for registration and caution mechanism. Thereafter, the Government will prepare as soon as possible a more concrete timetable for the preparation of the Land Titles (Amendment) Bill and introduction of such amendment bill to the LegCo for scrutiny.",

            "以下是今日（一月二十日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "香港律師會（律師會）近日經調查後發現一家律師行（該行）的一名前文員（俗稱「師爺」）不誠實挪用該行客戶款項，而該行涉嫌違反《律師帳目規則》（第159F章）的規定，包括透支客戶款項，以及容許不合資格人士成為客戶帳戶的簽署人。律師會已委任另一律師行為介入中介人（中介人），以處理善後工作。據報，該行主要承辦二手物業單位買賣及按揭業務，因此有不少物業買家把款項存放在該行。由於中介人處理善後工作需時，該等買家或會未能及時另聘律師接管其買賣交易事宜，以及取回存放於該行的交易款項，以致未能按買賣合約所訂定限期完成物業交易，並因而蒙受巨大損失。此外，由於該案件可能涉及該行合夥人本身刑事罪行，所以蒙受損失的客戶或未能透過律師專業彌償基金獲得賠償。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）是否知悉有多少名物業買家和賣家受上述案件影響，以及所涉物業交易款項總額；",
            "（二）有何措施協助加快中介人的工作，以便受影響客戶可盡早取回其存放於該行的交易款項，得以及時完成交易及避免巨大損失；",
            "（三）有否研究該案件的成因，以及有關監管制度及執行工作有否不足之處；",
            "（四）有何措施協助因上述案件而未能完成物業交易的苦主盡快追討金錢損失；及",
            "（五）鑑於有市民指出，現時二手物業交易涉及買賣雙方的律師翻查物業以往的所有契約以核實業權（若樓契遺失更須擬備樓契核證副本）的程序，費時失事和增添交易費用，並間接為律師行不良人員製造機會犯案圖利，政府會否加快檢討有關程序，以及盡快實施早於二○○四年制定的《土地業權條例》（第585章），以簡化物業轉易程序及減少買賣物業市民的律師費用及風險？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "香港法律業界實施行業自我監管的主要目的，是確保法律執業者的專業和獨立性。面對國際及本港法律市場不斷演變，法律業界自身亦是最有能力作出適切回應的。這機制對維護法治，以及同時維持香港作為法律、促成交易及爭議解決服務的國際法律樞紐的地位非常關鍵。",
            "香港律師會（律師會）是香港律師的監管機構，其權力及職能由《法律執業者條例》（香港法例第159章）及其附屬條例訂明。其中，根據第159章第26A條，在該條指明的情況下，包括在有理由懷疑某律師或其僱員不誠實的情況，律師會理事會（理事會）可通過決議行使法定權力，介入有關律師事務所的業務，行使第159章附表2所賦予的法定權力，包括處理該律師行的款項、文件和郵件的權力，並委任介入中介人（中介人）協助其介入，以保障有關律師行客戶和公眾的利益。",
            "就問題提及的個案，律師會於二○二○年十二月二十四日開始介入涉事律師事務所（涉事律師行）的業務。自此以來，律政司一直與律師會保持聯繫，了解事件發展。理事會認為有理由懷疑涉事律師行有前文員不誠實挪用涉事律師行的客戶款項，並信納涉事律師行嚴重違反《律師帳目規則》（香港法例第159F章）的規定，包括透支客戶款項，及容許不合資格人士成為客戶帳戶的簽署人。基於對涉事律師行的調查結果的嚴重程度，理事會認為別無他法，只可行使第159章第26A（1）（a）（ii）及26A（1）（c）條的法定權力，介入涉事律師行的業務，以保障涉事律師行的客戶以及公眾的利益。",
            "就謝偉俊議員的提問，律政司經向律師會作查詢及諮詢發展局和財經事務及庫務局後，現回覆如下：",
            "（一）律政司並沒有問題所要求的資料。經我們作查詢後，律師會同意披露以下資料。",
            "律師會表示，由於涉事律師行欠缺妥善的歸檔系統，而位於其總行的實體檔案非常混亂，因此中介人需時全面了解情況。有關受介入影響的物業買家和賣家數字，以及所涉物業交易款項總額，須待收集和整理所有資料，並經核對後才能確定。",
            "根據律師會截至二○二一年一月十五日掌握的情況，估計涉事律師行共有約935宗物業轉易案件於二○二○年十二月二十四日至二○二一年一月三十一日期間到期進行相關交易程序。",
            "（二）根據第159章附表2第2段所賦予律師會的法定權力，經介入後，涉事律師行的所有款項（包括該律師行的客戶存入該律師行客戶帳戶的款項）須歸屬理事會，並由理事會為享有該等款項的實益權益的人士以信託方式持有。",
            "據我們了解，理事會因應情況已委任另外五家律師事務所協助早前已獲理事會委任為中介人的律師事務所，務求盡快處理相關介入工作。",
            "律師會表示，中介人及提供協助的律師事務所目前的當務之急是從大量的檔案中找出相關檔案和地契，將具迫切性的檔案交還有關客戶；同時為所有檔案編製索引。截至二○二一年一月十五日，涉事律師行位於太子、荃灣及元朗的三間分行已騰空。中介人現正處理餘下的中環總行的檔案及事宜。",
            "完成處理緊急工作後，中介人計劃於二○二一年二月開始申索程序。中介人將須謹慎檢視證明文件以核實申索。",
            "在涉及不誠實行為或被介入的律師樓的檔案紀錄並不完整的情況下，退還有關的客戶款項必須獲得法庭命令的授權才可進行。",
            "中介人以及所有協助中介人的律師事務所正在盡最大努力，有效率地處理相關程序。律師會亦在力所能及的範圍內向中介人提供所需的人力支援，以配合他們的工作。然而，由於檔案數目眾多和紀錄混亂，相關程序需時處理。",
            "（三）律政司注意到，律師會已就該事件及其行使監管職能的法定權力作出公開解釋。由於有關涉事律師行的介入工作仍在進行，涉及未完成或可能提出的民事或刑事法律程序，律政司現時不適宜作任何評論。",
            "正如上文所述，香港法律業界實施行業自我監管，以確保法律執業者的專業和獨立性。第159章及其附屬條例訂明律師會為香港唯一獲法律授權監管律師專業分支的機構。律師會必須按照有關法律，獨立地行使就監管律師方面的權力和職能。",
            "若理事會認為一名律師或外地律師可能不適宜執業，並認為有需要調查有關事項，則可要求該名律師、外地律師或其律師事務所向理事會出示或交付相關文件。理事會亦可根據第159章第8AA（1）（a）條委任調查員查閱律師行的相關檔案、文件和會計文件，以核實有關律師行是否符合第159章、其附屬條例及其他專業守則的要求。",
            "就介入律師事務所的權力而言，根據第159章第26A（1）（a）條，理事會必須認為行使法定權力是符合公眾利益或有關律師事務所的當事人利益才可介入。律師會表示理事會在決定是否行使法定權力介入涉事律師行的業務時，已考慮所有相關的情況和客戶款項被挪用的風險，才行使法定權力介入，以保存客戶的款項和保護客戶的利益。",
            "律師會表示會不斷檢討其運作，並樂意聽取意見以作出改善。",
            "（四）正如於二○二一年一月十二日發出的新聞稿指出，律師會表示自介入以來，一直與不同持份者緊密合作，以盡量減低介入的影響，包括：",
            "（a）呼籲其他律師事務所協助涉事律師行的當事人，並舉辦簡介會說明如何為當事人提供協助；",
            "（b）向不同政府部門及司法機構政務處交代有關的介入；",
            "（c）向香港金融管理局（金管局）提供有關介入的最新消息，並致函香港銀行公會，呼籲銀行考慮為涉事律師行當事人提供支援措施；",
            "（d）告之消費者委員會及地產代理監管局有關的介入，並呼籲曾為涉事律師行當事人服務的地產代理持牌人，考慮協助措施；及",
            "（e）預備調解員名單，向受介入影響的各方提供調解服務，並與一些調解服務平台聯繫以尋求協助。",
            "金管局自得悉事件後，一直密切關注事件對銀行客戶的影響，並要求銀行主動聯絡受影響銀行客戶，以合理和諒解的態度為客戶提供適切的協助。據了解，銀行已聯絡因按揭貸款被凍結而造成迫切影響的客戶，並為他們提供協助及財務安排，包括有銀行為該行已發放按揭貸款但貸款遭凍結的客戶發放多一筆等值貸款；或為訂金遭凍結的客戶提供額外過渡貸款，讓交易能夠完成。此外，有轉按個案的新提供按揭銀行免除客戶立即開始供款的要求，讓客戶有時間處理舊按揭銀行貸款的事宜。由於涉事個案不盡相同，銀行會審視每宗個案，以提供適切的協助。金管局會與香港銀行公會及律師會保持溝通，以助銀行客戶得到適切的保障及協助。",
            "另外，稅務局印花稅署亦已公布以下安排協助受影響的印花稅納稅人：",
            "（a）若相關納稅人未能在限期前為其物業交易文書加蓋印花，印花稅署會考慮減免相關的逾期罰款。納稅人可自行或經其新聘任的律師向印花稅署提出減免罰款的申請；",
            "（b）如納稅人因律師行的戶口被凍結而未能於短期內籌備資金支付印花稅，可向印花稅署申請分期繳付；及",
            "（c）若物業交易最終未能完成，而原因並非買方將物業轉售或出售，則有關買賣協議無須繳付印花稅。納稅人可於該協議所協定的交易完成日期後兩年內申請退還已繳付的印花稅。",
            "稅務局已於二○二一年一月十二日就上述安排發出新聞公報。印花稅署亦已通知律師會，並積極接觸中介人及受影響的納稅人，協助其處理相關的印花稅事宜。",
            "（五）發展局表示，《土地業權條例》（香港法例第585章）（《條例》）旨在建立一個以業權註冊紀錄為物業業權不可推翻的證據的新制度，取代現時並無保證業權的契約註冊制度，從而為物業業權提供更大保障和明確性，並簡化在物業轉易時查核業權的程序。立法會於二○○四年七月通過制定《條例》時，要求政府在《條例》實施前就若干有待解決的議題進行全面檢討，並與各持份者商討，考慮對《條例》作進一步修訂。",
            "土地業權註冊制度本質上十分複雜，涉及複雜的法律問題，並且影響深遠。自《條例》制定以來，政府就《條例》進行全面檢討工作，過程充分諮詢主要持份者，並提出不同方案，以回應持份者對主要議題的分歧意見，當中包括將現有土地和物業轉換到新制度的機制（即轉換機制），以及更正機制和彌償安排。政府一直致力與主要持份者磋商，以協調他們對實施業權註冊制度的不同期望及回應他們的關注。",
            "為早日實施業權註冊制度，政府正積極推動先行在新土地（即指政府在《條例》生效後授予的土地）實施業權註冊的方案（「新土地先行」方案）。「新土地先行」方案已獲主要持份者原則上支持。政府會繼續與主要持份者磋商，致力就主要議題，包括彌償安排、核實註冊申請、警告書機制等事宜，尋求達成共識，然後盡快就草擬《土地業權（修訂）條例草案》及提交該修訂草案供立法會審議一事訂定具體時間表。",

            "The Law Society of Hong Kong (Law Society) has recently uncovered after an investigation that a former clerk (commonly known as legal executive) of a law firm (firm) dishonestly misappropriated the money of the firm's clients, and the firm allegedly breached the provisions of the Solicitors' Accounts Rules (Cap",
            "159F), including overdrawing on clients' accounts and allowing unqualified persons to be signatories of clients' accounts",
            "The Law Society has appointed another law firm as the Intervention Agent (Agent) to handle the follow-up work",
            "It has been reported that as the firm was mainly engaged in the business of sale and purchase (S&P) as well as mortgages of second-hand property units, quite a number of property buyers deposited money with the firm",
            "As it takes time for the Agent to handle the follow-up work, such buyers may not be able to engage in time alternative solicitors to take over matters related to their S&P transactions, and get back the transaction money deposited with the firm, resulting in their failure to complete property transactions by the deadlines specified in the S&P agreements, and hence their suffering of huge losses",
            "Besides, as the case may involve criminal offences committed by the partners of the firm, those clients who have suffered losses may not be able to receive compensation through the Solicitors' Professional Indemnity Fund",
            "In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it knows the respective numbers of property buyers and sellers affected by the aforesaid case, and the total amount of money involved in the property transactions concerned;",
            "(2) of the measures in place to help expedite the work of the Agent, so that the affected clients may get back the transaction money deposited with the firm as early as possible so that they may complete the transactions in time and avoid huge losses;",
            "(3) whether it has studied the causes of the case, and if there are inadequacies in the relevant regulatory regime and execution work;",
            "(4) of the measures in place to assist those victims who have been unable to complete property transactions due to the aforesaid case in recovering their monetary losses expeditiously; and",
            "(5) as some members of the public have pointed out that the transaction of a second-hand property currently involves the procedures of checking all previous deeds of the property by the solicitors of the buyer and seller to verify the title (and also the preparation of a certified copy of the assignment in case the assignment has been lost), and such procedures are time-consuming and cumbersome, incurring additional transaction costs and indirectly creating opportunities for unscrupulous personnel of law firms to commit offences for gains, whether the Government will expedite the review of such procedures, and implement as soon as possible the Land Titles Ordinance (Cap",
            "585) which was enacted as early as in 2004, so as to streamline the property conveyancing procedures, and reduce the solicitors' fees payable and the risks to be borne by members of the public in buying and selling properties?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The main purpose of implementing a self-regulatory regime for Hong Kong's legal profession is to ensure the professionalism and independence of Hong Kong legal practitioners",
            "The profession itself is also best placed to respond to the ever-changing landscape of international and local legal practices",
            "This regime is crucial to upholding the rule of law and at the same time maintaining Hong Kong's position as an international legal hub for deal-making and the provision of legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "The Law Society of Hong Kong (Law Society) is the regulatory body of solicitors in Hong Kong and its power and functions are laid down in the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap",
            "159) and its subsidiary legislation",
            "Amongst others, section 26A of Cap",
            "159 specifies the circumstances under which the Council of the Law Society (Council) may pass a resolution to exercise its statutory power to intervene into a law firm's practice, including where there is reason to suspect dishonesty on the part of a solicitor or an employee of a solicitor",
            "Upon intervention, the Council may exercise the powers set out in Schedule 2 to Cap",
            "159, including those relating to the handling of money, documents and mail of that law firm and appointing an intervention agent (IA) to assist in the intervention, for the protection of the interests of the clients of that firm and the public.",
            "With respect to the case mentioned in the question, the Law Society intervened into the practice of the relevant law firm (Intervened Firm) on December 24, 2020",
            "Since then, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has been in contact with the Law Society so as to be apprised of the developments",
            "The Council considered that it had reason to suspect that a former clerk of the Intervened Firm had dishonestly misappropriated clients' money of the Intervened Firm, and was satisfied that there were serious breaches of the regulations of the Solicitors' Accounts Rules (Cap",
            "159F) by the Intervened Firm, including overdrawing on client accounts and allowing unqualified persons to be authorised signatories of client accounts",
            "Taking into account the seriousness of the findings of the investigation against the Intervened Firm, the Council considered that it had no alternative but to exercise the statutory power pursuant to sections 26A(1)(a)(ii) and 26A(1)(c) of Cap",
            "159 to intervene into the practice of the Intervened Firm to protect the interests of its clients and the public.",
            "With regard to the question raised by the Hon Paul Tse, the DoJ, having made enquiries with the Law Society and consulted the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, replies as follows:",
            "(1) The DoJ does not have any of the information requested in the question",
            "The Law Society, having been enquired by us, agreed to disclose the following information.",
            "The Law Society indicated that since the Intervened Firm does not have a proper filing system and the physical files located at its head office are very disorganised, it takes time for the IA to acquire a full picture",
            "The exact number of property buyers and sellers affected in the case, as well as the amount of clients' money being involved could only be ascertained after all the information has been obtained, collated and verified.",
            "According to the information gathered by the Law Society as at January 15, 2021, it is estimated that there are around 935 conveyancing matters with imminent deadlines for the period between December 24, 2020 and January 31, 2021.",
            "(2) Section 2 of Schedule 2 to Cap",
            "159 provides that upon intervention, all sums of money of the Intervened Firm (including all sums of money deposited into the Intervened Firm's client account by its clients) shall vest in the Council and shall be held by the Council on trust for the persons beneficially entitled to them.",
            "We understand that the Council has already appointed five other law firms to assist the IA in order to handle the work related to the intervention as quickly as possible.",
            "According to the Law Society, the urgent tasks for the IA and the assisting law firms at the moment are to locate the files and title deeds from a large number of files, return the files with urgent deadlines to relevant clients, and index the files",
            "As at January 15, 2021, the Intervened Firm's three branch offices in Prince Edward, Tsuen Wan and Yuen Long have already been vacated",
            "The IA is currently processing the remaining files and affairs of the Intervened Firm's head office at Central.",
            "Upon completion of the urgent tasks, the IA plans to launch the claim procedure in February 2021",
            "The IA would need to check the supporting documents with care to verify the claims.",
            "In circumstances where dishonesty is involved or where records of the intervened law firm are incomplete, the release of clients' money has to be subject to authorisation by a court order.",
            "The IA and all the assisting firms are doing their best to handle the process efficiently",
            "The Law Society is also doing what it can within its capacity to provide the necessary manpower support to the IA to facilitate its work",
            "However, given the volume of files and that the records are disorganised, the process would take some time.",
            "(3) The DoJ notes that the Law Society has already explained publicly about the said incident and its statutory powers in the exercise of its regulatory function",
            "As the intervention of the Intervened Firm is still ongoing and involves uncompleted or possible civil or criminal proceedings, it is not appropriate for the DoJ to comment at this stage.",
            "As aforementioned, Hong Kong's legal profession implements a self-regulatory regime to ensure the professionalism and independence of Hong Kong legal practitioners",
            "Cap",
            "159 and its subsidiary legislation stipulate that the Law Society is the only institution in Hong Kong authorised by law to regulate the professional branch of solicitors",
            "The Law Society must independently exercise its powers and discharge their functions and duties to regulate solicitors in accordance with the relevant enactment.",
            "Where the Council considers that a solicitor or foreign lawyer may be unfit to practise, the Council may, if it considers it necessary for the purpose of investigating the matter, require the solicitor, the foreign lawyer or his/her firm to produce or deliver relevant documents to the Council",
            "The Council may also appoint an inspector under section 8AA(1)(a) of Cap",
            "159 to conduct an inspection of a law firm on its relevant files, documents and accounting records for the purpose of verifying the firm's compliance with Cap",
            "159, its subsidiary legislation and other relevant professional conduct rules.",
            "In relation to the power of intervention, according to section 26A(1)(a) of Cap",
            "159, the Council, before intervening into the practice of a law firm, must consider that the exercise of such statutory power is in the interests of the public or the clients of that firm",
            "The Law Society indicated that, in deciding whether to exercise its statutory power to intervene into the practice of the Intervened Firm, the Council has already taken into account all relevant circumstances and the risks to clients' money being misappropriated",
            "It exercised its statutory power to intervene in order to preserve the clients' money and to protect clients' interests.",
            "The Law Society indicated that it would keep their operation under constant review and is always open to suggestion with a view to improving it.",
            "(4) As pointed out in its press release of January 12, 2021, the Law Society indicated that since the intervention, it has been working closely with different stakeholders to minimise its impact, including:",
            "(a) calling for law firms to assist clients of the Intervened Firm and conducting a briefing session for them on how they could assist;",
            "(b) informing different government bureaux/departments and the Judiciary Administration of the intervention;",
            "(c) updating the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on the intervention and written to the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to urge banks to consider support measures for clients of the Intervened Firm;",
            "(d) alerting the Consumer Council and the Estate Agents Authority of the intervention and urging licensed estate agents who have acted for the clients of the Intervened Firm to consider assistance for them; and",
            "(e) co-ordinating a list of mediators to provide mediation services to parties affected by the intervention and talking to a number of mediation service platforms to seek their assistance.",
            "The HKMA has been closely monitoring the impact on bank customers since it became aware of the incident, and has requested banks to proactively approach affected customers and provide appropriate assistance in a reasonable and accommodating manner",
            "It is understood that banks concerned have already contacted customers who are imminently affected due to the freeze of their mortgage loans and offered assistance as appropriate including financial arrangements",
            "Such include the granting of a mortgage loan of equivalent amount to customers whose mortgage loans have already been disbursed by the bank and yet now frozen, or the provision of an additional bridging loan to customers whose property purchase deposits have been frozen such that the property transactions in question can be completed",
            "Besides, there are also cases involving mortgage refinancing where the new mortgage bank has granted payment holiday for affected customers such that they have time to make arrangements for the original mortgage loans",
            "As cases differ in their circumstances, banks will examine each and every case in order to provide appropriate assistance",
            "The HKMA will continue to communicate with the HKAB and the Law Society with a view to facilitating the offer of suitable protection and assistance to affected bank customers.",
            "Besides, the Stamp Office of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has announced the following arrangements to assist the affected duty payers:",
            "(a) if a duty payer concerned is unable to arrange stamping of a property transaction instrument before the time limit, the Stamp Office will consider remission of penalty for late stamping",
            "The duty payer can make an application to the Stamp Office for remission of penalty directly or through the newly engaged solicitor;",
            "(b) if the duty payer is unable to raise funds to settle the stamp duty payable within a short period of time due to the freezing of relevant bank accounts of the law firm, an application can be made to the Stamp Office for payment by instalment; and",
            "(c) if a property transaction cannot be completed otherwise than by reason of re-sale or disposal of the property by the purchaser, the relevant agreement for sale is not chargeable with stamp duty",
            "The duty payer can apply for refund of the stamp duty paid in respect of the relevant agreement within two years after the agreed date of completion of the transaction.",
            "The IRD issued a press release on the above arrangement on January 12, 2021, and the Stamp Office has also informed the Law Society and is proactively reaching out to its appointed IA and the affected duty payers to assist them in handling the relevant stamp duty matters.",
            "(5) According to the DEVB, the Land Titles Ordinance (Cap",
            "585) (LTO) aims to establish a new system under which the Title Register will be conclusive evidence as to the title of the property, to replace the present deeds registration system that gives no guarantee to title, with a view to providing greater assurance and certainty to property titles as well as simplifying the procedures of title checking in conveyancing",
            "The Legislative Council (LegCo), when passing the LTO in July 2004, requested the Government to conduct a comprehensive review on a number of outstanding issues and consider making further amendments to the LTO in consultation with the stakeholders before its implementation.",
            "The land title registration system is inherently complicated",
            "It involves complex legal issues and carries significant implications",
            "Since the enactment of the LTO, the Government has carried out a comprehensive review of the LTO in full consultation with the major stakeholders, and put forth various proposals to address stakeholders' divergent views over the main issues, including the mechanism for bringing existing land and properties under the new system (i.e",
            "conversion mechanism) and the rectification and indemnity arrangements",
            "The Government has been making continuous efforts in engaging the major stakeholders, bridging their different expectations and addressing their concerns on implementing the title registration system.",
            "In order to achieve early implementation of the title registration system, the Government is actively pursuing the proposal of implementing title registration on newly granted land first (i.e",
            "land granted by the Government after the commencement of the LTO) (\"new land first\" proposal) and has secured support in principle for the proposal from the major stakeholders",
            "The Government will continue engaging the major stakeholders and strive to reach a consensus on the major issues including indemnity arrangements, verification of applications for registration and caution mechanism",
            "Thereafter, the Government will prepare as soon as possible a more concrete timetable for the preparation of the Land Titles (Amendment) Bill and introduction of such amendment bill to the LegCo for scrutiny.",

            "以下是今日（一月二十日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "香港律師會（律師會）近日經調查後發現一家律師行（該行）的一名前文員（俗稱「師爺」）不誠實挪用該行客戶款項，而該行涉嫌違反《律師帳目規則》（第159F章）的規定，包括透支客戶款項，以及容許不合資格人士成為客戶帳戶的簽署人",

            "據報，該行主要承辦二手物業單位買賣及按揭業務，因此有不少物業買家把款項存放在該行",
            "由於中介人處理善後工作需時，該等買家或會未能及時另聘律師接管其買賣交易事宜，以及取回存放於該行的交易款項，以致未能按買賣合約所訂定限期完成物業交易，並因而蒙受巨大損失",
            "此外，由於該案件可能涉及該行合夥人本身刑事罪行，所以蒙受損失的客戶或未能透過律師專業彌償基金獲得賠償",
            "就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）是否知悉有多少名物業買家和賣家受上述案件影響，以及所涉物業交易款項總額；",

            "（五）鑑於有市民指出，現時二手物業交易涉及買賣雙方的律師翻查物業以往的所有契約以核實業權（若樓契遺失更須擬備樓契核證副本）的程序，費時失事和增添交易費用，並間接為律師行不良人員製造機會犯案圖利，政府會否加快檢討有關程序，以及盡快實施早於二○○四年制定的《土地業權條例》（第585章），以簡化物業轉易程序及減少買賣物業市民的律師費用及風險？",
