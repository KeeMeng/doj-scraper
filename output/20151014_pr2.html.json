            "The following is a statement made today (October 14) by the Department of Justice (DoJ) in respect of the criminal complaint made by Mr Symon Wong against the Chief Justice and two Magistrates:",
            "In April 2015, a criminal complaint was made by Mr Symon Wong, then a Permanent Magistrate, against the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, Mr Geoffrey Ma Tao-li, the Chief Magistrate Mr Clement Lee Hing-nin and Principal Magistrate Ms Bernadette Woo Huey-fang. Legal advice was sought by the police as to whether the complaint disclosed any criminal offence.",
            "To avoid the perception of any real or apparent bias and having satisfied that the Director of Public Prosecutions has no conflict of interest, the Secretary for Justice has delegated to him the conduct of this case. The DoJ has also obtained independent legal advice from an overseas Queen's Counsel.",
            "Put short, Mr Wong complained that as a result of the three aforesaid members of the Judiciary having got together to persuade him to send an email to withdraw his complaint against Deputy High Court Judge Mr Michael Stuart-Moore, he had been deprived of his legitimate right to pursue an internal disciplinary complaint against the Deputy Judge.",
            "Having carefully considered all the available evidence, including the statements which Mr Wong has given to the police, and having considered also the legal advice given by the Queen's Counsel, the Director of Public Prosecutions has concluded that the complaint disclosed, both in law and in fact, no possible criminal offence against any of the persons Mr Wong complained against, and the police have been so advised.",
            "The DoJ's normal practice is not to go into details of a criminal complaint otherwise than in the course of a criminal trial. However, in light of the exceptional circumstances of the present case, including the fact that details of the complaint have already been disclosed in the public domain and that very serious allegations have been made against members of the Judiciary, the DoJ considers that it is in the public interest to outline the criminal complaint and the reasons for advising the police that the complaint, taken to its highest, disclosed no criminal offence.",
            "For the present purpose, Mr Wong's complaint can be summarised as follows (Note).",
            "Mr Wong was the presiding magistrate in a criminal case in which the defendant faced charges of possession of apparatus fit and intended for the inhalation of dangerous drugs and possession of dangerous drugs. The defendant appeared in person on the trial date and applied for an adjournment so that he could seek legal representation. Mr Wong granted the adjournment but revoked the defendant's bail.",
            "The defendant applied for a bail review pursuant to section 9J of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap 221) and the application was heard before Deputy High Court Judge Stuart-Moore. The Deputy Judge granted bail to the defendant and made criticisms of Mr Wong's revocation of the defendant's bail.",
            "Mr Wong sent to the Chief Justice an email complaining about the criticisms made by Deputy Judge Stuart-Moore and asked for the matter to be investigated into. The email was copied to other judges, including the Chief Magistrate and Principal Magistrate Woo (who was at the material time a good friend of Mr Wong).",
            "Principal Magistrate Woo advised Mr Wong that his email to the Chief Magistrate was inappropriate and suggested that he should send another email in softer tone. Mr Wong agreed to her suggestion and showed her a draft later. Principal Magistrate Woo considered the draft email was inappropriate and said a very capable person would draft a letter for him.",
            "When Principal Magistrate Woo presented Mr Wong with a draft letter to the effect that Mr Wong apologised for his original complaint and accepted his own responsibility for revoking the bail of the defendant, he was not happy with the contents as he thought it did not set out his position. Principal Magistrate Woo suggested him to delete the apology to Deputy Judge Stuart-Moore and send out the email. Mr Wong agreed to her suggestion, deleted the apology in the draft letter, reduced the rest of the contents of the draft letter into an email and sent it to the Chief Magistrate who afterwards forwarded it to the Chief Justice.",
            "Mr Wong said Principal Magistrate Woo subsequently admitted to him that the letter was not drafted by the very capable person but by the Chief Magistrate.",
            "Mr Wong also suggested that the writing style of the letter was that of a foreigner and hence could not have been drafted by Principal Magistrate Woo or the Chief Magistrate. Judging from the writing style, Mr Wong considered that it was very likely to have been drafted by the Chief Justice as he writes fluent English.",
            "Mr Wong considered that the letter was sent to him with the calculative motive that no inquiry or disciplinary proceedings against Deputy Judge Stuart-Moore would be held. This was the basis of his complaint of perverting the course of public justice and misconduct in public office against the three judicial officers. Furthermore, it was alleged that as the Chief Magistrate knew that the letter did not reflect Mr Wong's intention, when the Chief Magistrate forwarded his email to the Chief Justice, the Chief Magistrate was using a false instrument.",
            "The overseas Queen's Counsel was of the opinion that when Mr Wong adopted the contents of the draft letter in his email, he was accepting the advice of a close friend and must have known from the contents that he was withdrawing any complaint he had lodged against the Deputy Judge. A strong advice given by a close friend to persuade a person to withdraw a complaint, not accompanied by threat, bribe, a promise for financial reward or other unlawful means does not fall within the ambit of the offence of perverting the course of public justice: R v Kellett [1976] 1 QB 372. The misrepresentation as to who drafted the letter did not amount to an unlawful means.",
            "In the circumstances, there was no basis to suggest that the Chief Magistrate knew that the email of Mr Wong was false in the sense that it did not reflect his revised and considered position.",
            "As regards the complaint that it was the Chief Justice who had drafted the letter, the Queen's Counsel considered that the basis of Mr Wong's suggestion, namely the drafting style of the letter, was obviously hopeless.",
            "Having also considered the matter independently, the DoJ agrees with the opinion of the Queen's Counsel, including:",
            "(1) The email was sent by Mr Wong with his full knowledge and acceptance of the contents. There was no suggestion that he sent the email otherwise than freely and voluntarily;",
            "(2) There is thus no basis to suggest that the email was a false document. There is in addition no basis to suggest that anybody had knowingly used any false document;",
            "(3) Further, in so far as the complaint against the Chief Justice is concerned, the allegation, based upon the drafting style of the letter, that he was the author of the letter, is entirely baseless;",
            "(4) In any event, even if all the factual allegations made by Mr Wong can be established, both the purpose of and the means used by Principal Magistrate Woo and the Chief Magistrate in approaching Mr Wong to persuade him to withdraw the complaint against the Deputy Judge were not unlawful. Thus, their conduct did not have a tendency towards \"impairing (or preventing the exercise of) the capacity of a court or competent judicial authority to do justice\": HKSAR v Wong Chi Wai (2013) 16 HKCFAR 539;",
            "(5) There is thus no basis to suggest that there had been any conspiracy to pervert the course of justice;",
            "(6) There is thus further no basis to suggest that there had been any misconduct on the part of any of the three judicial officers;",
            "(7) It follows that there was simply no misconduct on the part of any of the three judicial officers capable of forming the basis of the offence of misconduct in public office.",
            "Note: The summary of Mr Wong's complaint, as set out in paragraphs 7 to 15 of this statement, contains allegations made by Mr Wong. For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that references are made to such allegations does not mean (and should not be taken to mean) that such allegations have been established.",

            "以下是律政司今日（十月十四日）就黃汝榮向終審法院首席法官及兩名裁判官提出刑事投訴一事發表的聲明:",
            "二○一五年四月，時任常任裁判官黃汝榮向終審法院首席法官馬道立、總裁判官李慶年及主任裁判官吳蕙芳提出刑事投訴。就該投訴有否揭露刑事罪行的法律問題，警方向律政司尋求指引。",
            "為免予人任何偏頗（確實或表面）的觀感，並經信納刑事檢控專員於此事件上並無利益衝突，律政司司長遂授權刑事檢控專員處理這案件。律政司亦曾就這案件向海外御用大律師取得獨立法律意見。",
            "簡言之，黃汝榮投訴上述三名司法人員聯同游說他發出電郵，撤銷他針對高等法院暫委法官司徒冕的投訴，因此令他被剝奪合法權利，不能繼續以內部紀律途徑投訴該暫委法官。",
            "經小心考慮現有證據，包括黃汝榮提供給警方的陳述書，並經考慮御用大律師的法律意見，刑事檢控專員認為黃汝榮的投訴，無論在法律及事實上，均沒有就上述被投訴人士揭露任何刑事罪行。警方亦已被知會上述結論。",
            "律政司處理刑事投訴，一般只會在刑事審訊過程中才會深入討論案件細節。然而，鑑於本案情況特殊，包括該投訴的詳情已經在公眾層面廣為披露，並涉及針對司法人員作出非常嚴重的指控，律政司認為基於公眾利益，應向公眾解述該刑事投訴，及給予警方的法律意見，即為何即使以最寬鬆的尺度去考慮，黃汝榮的投訴也沒有披露任何刑事罪行。",
            "為作上述解述，現先簡介黃汝榮向警方作出的投訴（註）。",
            "黃汝榮是一宗刑事案件的主審裁判官，案中被告人面對「管有適合於及擬用作吸服危險藥物的器具」及「管有危險藥物」兩項控罪。審訊當日，被告人無律師代表，親自到法庭，申請押後聆訊，以便委託律師代表。黃汝榮批准押後聆訊，但撤銷被告人保釋。",
            "被告人依據《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）第9J條申請保釋覆核，該項申請在高等法院暫委法官司徒冕席前審理。暫委法官司徒冕批准被告人保釋，並對黃汝榮撤銷被告人的保釋作出批評。",
            "黃汝榮向首席法官發出電郵，投訴暫委法官司徒冕所作的批評，並要求調查事件。該電郵副本則傳送給其他法官，包括總裁判官及在相關期間是黃汝榮的好朋友的主任裁判官吳蕙芳。",
            "主任裁判官吳蕙芳勸告黃汝榮，指他給予總裁判官的電郵並不恰當，建議他發出另一封語氣較溫和的電郵。黃汝榮同意建議，其後將一份草稿交給她。主任裁判官吳蕙芳認為黃汝榮擬寫的電郵仍不恰當，並說有一位「高人」會幫他撰寫信件。",
            "主任裁判官吳蕙芳其後將一封撰寫信件展示給黃汝榮看，內容說黃汝榮為原來的投訴道歉，並為撤銷上述被告人的保釋承擔責任。黃汝榮當時對信件內容感到不高興，因他認為信件內容並無反映他的立場。主任裁判官吳蕙芳建議刪去向暫委法官司徒冕的道歉並發出電郵。黃汝榮接受建議，刪去撰寫信內的道歉，其餘內容轉為電郵，發給總裁判官，而總裁判官其後轉發給首席法官。",
            "黃汝榮指主任裁判官吳蕙芳其後向他承認上述信件並非由「高人」撰寫，而是由總裁判官撰寫。",
            "黃汝榮又說由於信件是外國人的書寫風格，因此信件不可能是主任裁判官吳蕙芳或總裁判官撰寫。從書寫風格判斷，黃汝榮認為由於首席法官馬道立的英文行文流暢，信件相當有可能是由首席法官撰寫。",
            "黃汝榮認為給他上述信件，背後有處心積慮的目的，即希望避免針對暫委法官司徒冕進行聆訊或紀律法律程序。以上為黃汝榮投訴上述三名司法人員「妨礙司法公正」及「公職人員行為失當」的基礎。此外，黃汝榮亦指稱由於總裁判官明知該封信件沒有反映他的意願，總裁判官仍轉發給首席法官，總裁判官因此涉及使用虛假文書。",
            "海外御用大律師認為，當黃汝榮在電郵中採納撰寫信內容時，他是接受好朋友的勸告，亦必定從內容得知是撤銷針對暫委法官所提出的投訴。雖然要好的朋友力勸撤銷投訴，但沒有涉及威嚇、賄賂、答應以金錢作報酬或其他不法手段，因此不屬妨礙司法公正這罪行的範疇︰R v Kellet [1976] 1 QB 372。至於有關誰是信件撰寫者的失實陳述，亦不構成不合法手段。",
            "在此情況下，若說總裁判官知道黃汝榮的電郵是虛假，意即電郵沒有反映黃汝榮曾斟酌思量及重新檢討的立場，這是絕無基礎可言。",
            "至於黃汝榮在投訴中指撰寫信件的人是首席法官，御用大律師認為單憑信件撰寫風格而作以上推論，能得到確立的機會渺茫。",
            "經獨立考慮本案相關事宜後，律政司同意御用大律師的意見，特別是以下各點：",
            "（一）發出電郵時，黃汝榮完全知悉和接納內容。他沒有提出並非自願或並非自主地發出電郵；",
            "（二）因此沒有基礎顯示電郵是虛假文件，更無基礎顯示任何人明知地使用虛假文件；",
            "（三）此外，就針對首席法官的投訴而言，基於信件的撰寫風格而指信件來自首席法官手筆的指控全無根據；",
            "（四）無論如何，即使黃汝榮作出的全部事實指控可予證實，主任裁判官吳蕙芳及總裁判官找黃汝榮游說他撤銷投訴暫委法官，他們的目的及所用方法也不屬違法。因此他們的行為並沒有傾向「損害法庭或法定管轄司法機構（或妨礙其行使）執行公義的功能」HKSAR v Wong Chi Wai（2013）16 HKCFAR 539；",
            "（五）因此沒有基礎顯示本案涉及任何串謀妨礙司法公正；",
            "（六）因此更沒有基礎顯示本案的三名司法人員有任何不當行為；",
            "（七）據此，案中三名司法機構人員根本沒有任何一位涉及可構成「公職人員行為失當」這罪行基礎的失當行為。",
            "註：黃汝榮的投訴摘要（即在本新聞公報第七至十五段列出的摘要），包含黃汝榮的指控。為免生疑問，本新聞稿在提及該等指控時，並不意指（也不應當作意指）該等指控已獲確立。",

            "黃汝榮又說由於信件是外國人的書寫風格，因此信件不可能是主任裁判官吳蕙芳或總裁判官撰寫",
            "從書寫風格判斷，黃汝榮認為由於首席法官馬道立的英文行文流暢，信件相當有可能是由首席法官撰寫",
            "黃汝榮認為給他上述信件，背後有處心積慮的目的，即希望避免針對暫委法官司徒冕進行聆訊或紀律法律程序",
            "以上為黃汝榮投訴上述三名司法人員「妨礙司法公正」及「公職人員行為失當」的基礎",
            "此外，黃汝榮亦指稱由於總裁判官明知該封信件沒有反映他的意願，總裁判官仍轉發給首席法官，總裁判官因此涉及使用虛假文書",
            "海外御用大律師認為，當黃汝榮在電郵中採納撰寫信內容時，他是接受好朋友的勸告，亦必定從內容得知是撤銷針對暫委法官所提出的投訴",
            "至於有關誰是信件撰寫者的失實陳述，亦不構成不合法手段",
            "在此情況下，若說總裁判官知道黃汝榮的電郵是虛假，意即電郵沒有反映黃汝榮曾斟酌思量及重新檢討的立場，這是絕無基礎可言",
            "至於黃汝榮在投訴中指撰寫信件的人是首席法官，御用大律師認為單憑信件撰寫風格而作以上推論，能得到確立的機會渺茫",
            "經獨立考慮本案相關事宜後，律政司同意御用大律師的意見，特別是以下各點：",
            "（一）發出電郵時，黃汝榮完全知悉和接納內容",
            "他沒有提出並非自願或並非自主地發出電郵；",
            "（二）因此沒有基礎顯示電郵是虛假文件，更無基礎顯示任何人明知地使用虛假文件；",
            "（三）此外，就針對首席法官的投訴而言，基於信件的撰寫風格而指信件來自首席法官手筆的指控全無根據；",
            "（四）無論如何，即使黃汝榮作出的全部事實指控可予證實，主任裁判官吳蕙芳及總裁判官找黃汝榮游說他撤銷投訴暫委法官，他們的目的及所用方法也不屬違法",
            "（五）因此沒有基礎顯示本案涉及任何串謀妨礙司法公正；",
            "（六）因此更沒有基礎顯示本案的三名司法人員有任何不當行為；",
            "（七）據此，案中三名司法機構人員根本沒有任何一位涉及可構成「公職人員行為失當」這罪行基礎的失當行為",
            "註：黃汝榮的投訴摘要（即在本新聞公報第七至十五段列出的摘要），包含黃汝榮的指控",
            "為免生疑問，本新聞稿在提及該等指控時，並不意指（也不應當作意指）該等指控已獲確立",
