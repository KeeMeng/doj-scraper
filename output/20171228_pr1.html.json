            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) today (December 28) launched a two-month public consultation to seek views on the proposed continuing powers of attorney legislation in Hong Kong.",
            "A spokesman for the DoJ said, \"It is proposed that a new Continuing Powers of Attorney Ordinance be enacted to extend the scope of an enduring power of attorney to include matters relating to the personal care of the donor.\"",
            "The spokesman pointed out that according to the existing Enduring Powers of Attorney (EPA) Ordinance (Cap. 501), an EPA is a legal instrument which allows its donor (i.e. the person who gives a power of attorney in favour of someone), while he or she is still mentally capable, to appoint attorney(s) to take care of the donor's affairs in the event that he or she subsequently becomes mentally incapacitated.",
            "While a general power of attorney will cease to be effective if the donor becomes mentally incapacitated, an EPA will \"endure\" the donor's mental incapacity and give the attorney(s) the power to continue to take care of the donor's affairs despite such incapacity.",
            "At present, the powers which may be delegated under an EPA in Hong Kong are limited to decisions in relation to the property and financial affairs of the donor.",
            "The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC) published the report on \"Enduring Powers of Attorney: Personal Care\" (2011 Report) in July 2011. The report recommended the extension of the scope of an EPA to cover not only decisions on a donor's roperty and financial affairs, but also decisions on a donor's personal care.",
            "Subsequently, the DoJ established an inter-departmental working group (IWG) to study the 2011 Report. The IWG includes members from the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the Food and Health Bureau and the Social Welfare Department.",
            "\"After careful consideration of the views and recommendations of the LRC and those provided by members of the IWG, it is proposed that a new Continuing Powers of Attorney Ordinance be enacted to replace the existing EPA scheme with a new regime known as the continuing power of attorney to distinguish it from an EPA created under the existing Enduring Powers of Attorney Ordinance,\" the spokesman added.",
            "According to the said proposal, while new EPAs may no longer be created after the commencement of the Continuing Powers of Attorney Ordinance, EPAs executed prior to that would continue to be governed by the Enduring Powers of Attorney Ordinance.",

            "發言人指出，根據現行的《持久授權書條例》（香港法例第501章），持久授權書是法律文件，容許授權人（即將其權力授予其他人的人士）在精神上有能力行事時委任受權人，以便在授權人日後變為精神上無行為能力時，受權人可照顧其事務。",
            "一般授權書在授權人變為精神上無行為能力時，便會失去效力，但持久授權書在授權人喪失精神上行為能力後，仍會「持久」有效，並賦權力予受權人，繼續處理授權人的事務。",

            "根據該建議，在新的《持續授權書條例》生效後，便不能再訂立持久授權書。然而，在該生效日期前訂立的持久授權書所涉及的事宜，會繼續受原有的《持久授權書條例》規管。",
