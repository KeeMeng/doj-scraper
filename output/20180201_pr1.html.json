            "The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) conducted a comprehensive investigation into various complaints against Mr Lee Cheuk-yan, Mr Alan Leong Kah-kit, Mr James To Kun-sun, Ms Claudia Mo Man-ching, Ms Tanya Chan, Mr Lai Chee-ying and Mr Mark Herman Simon. Having carefully considered the investigation reports and the relevant materials submitted by the ICAC, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has advised that there is no sufficient evidence to institute prosecution against the above-mentioned parties.",
            "Prosecution Criteria",
            "According to the Prosecution Code, a prosecutor must consider two issues in deciding whether to prosecute. First, whether there is sufficient evidence to justify instituting or continuing proceedings. Second, if there is sufficient evidence, whether the public interest requires a prosecution to be pursued. A prosecution should not be instituted or continued unless the prosecutor is satisfied that there is legally sufficient evidence to support a prosecution: that is, evidence that is admissible and reliable and, together with any reasonable inference able to be drawn from it, likely to prove the offence. The test is whether the evidence demonstrates a reasonable prospect of conviction. In the present case, the decision not to prosecute the above-mentioned parties is solely based upon insufficiency of evidence.",
            "DoJ's decision",
            "The available evidence reveals that Mr Lai offered $1.5 million and $300,000 to Mr Lee and Mr Leong respectively through Mr Simon, and that Mr Lee and Mr Leong accepted the respective payments. As for Mr To, Ms Mo and Ms Chan, there is no evidence that they accepted any payments from Mr Lai or Mr Simon.",
            "The major allegation against Mr Lee and Mr Leong is that they failed to declare to the Legislative Council (LegCo) their receipt of the respective payments, which may constitute the Common Law offence of Misconduct in Public Office (MIPO). Mr Lai and Mr Simon were alleged to have committed offences in connection with MIPO.",
            "It is pertinent to note that against a similar background, Mr Leung Kwok-hung (Mr Leung) was prosecuted for one count of MIPO in the District Court (DCCC 546/2016). The allegation against Mr Leung was that he, in his capacity as a then LegCo Member, received a sum of $250,000 from Mr Lai through Mr Simon but he failed to declare such receipt to LegCo.",
            "After trial, Judge Alex Lee found that (1) there is no prohibition for a LegCo Member to receive donations/financial sponsorships from any person or organisation; (2) if a LegCo Member receives donations/financial sponsorships on behalf of his political party/organisation, the declaration requirement is not triggered; (3) on the evidence, it could not be disproved beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Leung might have received the said sum on behalf of his political party, namely the League of Social Democrats; and (4) on the basis of (3) above, it could not be concluded that Mr Leung was obliged to declare to LegCo such receipt. As such, the judge acquitted Mr Leung of the charge of MIPO on July 31, 2017.",
            "Similar to Mr Leung, the existing evidence reveals that Mr Lee and Mr Leong might have received the respective payments on behalf of their political party/organisation. There is no reasonable prospect of establishing to the requisite standard that Mr Lee and Mr Leong received the respective payments beneficially for themselves. Adopting the above basis, they were not obliged to declare their receipt to LegCo. It follows that no offence of MIPO against them can be substantiated.",
            "Since no offence of MIPO can be made out against Mr Lee or Mr Leong, there is also no reasonable prospect of proving any MIPO-related offences (such as conspiracy) against Mr Lai or Mr Simon.",
            "For the sake of completeness, there is also insufficient evidence to substantiate other criminal offences against the above-mentioned parties.",
            "The DoJ's decision not to institute prosecution against the above-mentioned parties has been made in accordance with the Prosecution Code and the applicable law.",
            "The decision taken has been explained so that the public are fully and properly informed about this case which has been the subject of public concern.",

            "廉政公署已就有關李卓人、梁家傑、涂謹申、毛孟靜、陳淑莊、黎智英及Mark Herman Simon的多項投訴進行全面調查。律政司仔細考慮廉政公署提交的調查報告及相關資料後，認為沒有足夠證據對上述人士提出檢控。",
            "檢控準則",
            "根據《檢控守則》，檢控人員在決定應否提出檢控時須考慮兩大問題：第一，是否有充分證據支持提出和繼續進行檢控。第二，若有充分證據，進行檢控是否符合公眾利益。除非檢控人員信納在法律上有充分證據支持提出檢控，即這些可接納和可靠的證據，連同可從相關證據作出的合理推論，有相當機會能證明有關罪行，否則不應提出或繼續進行檢控。而驗證標準則為是否有合理機會達致定罪。就本案而言，不對上述人士提出檢控的決定完全是建基於證據不足的考慮。",
            "律政司的決定",
            "現有證據顯示，黎智英透過Mark Herman Simon向李卓人及梁家傑分別提供一百五十萬港元及三十萬港元，而李卓人及梁家傑分別收取有關款項。至於涂謹申、毛孟靜及陳淑莊，則並無證據顯示他們收取黎智英或Mark Herman Simon的任何款項。",
            "對李卓人及梁家傑的主要指控，是他們沒有向立法會申報其各自收取的款項，可能構成普通法下的公職人員行為失當罪。而黎智英及Mark Herman Simon被指涉嫌觸犯與公職人員行為失當有關的罪行。",
            "必須注意的是，在類似的背景下，梁國雄在區域法院DCCC 546/2016一案中，被控一項公職人員行為失當罪。他被指以當時為立法會議員的身分，透過Mark Herman Simon收取黎智英一筆二十五萬港元的款項，而沒有向立法會作出申報。",
            "經審訊後，區域法院法官李運騰指出：",
            "（一）並沒有規定立法會議員不得接受任何人士或機構的捐款／財務資助；",
            "（二）如立法會議員代表其政黨／組織收取捐款／財務資助，並不觸及申報的規定；",
            "（三）證據上不能在毫無合理疑點下否定梁國雄可能代表其政黨（即社會民主連線）收取上述款項；及",
            "（四）根據上述（三），並不能斷定梁國雄有責任向立法會申報該筆收取的款項。",
            "因此，李運騰法官於二○一七年七月三十一日裁定梁國雄公職人員行為失當罪名不成立。",
            "與梁國雄的情況類似，現有的證據顯示，李卓人及梁家傑有可能代表其政黨／組織收取相關款項，並無合理機會按所需標準證實李卓人及梁家傑個人收取有關款項。按前述的基礎，他們沒有責任向立法會申報收取上述款項。因此，不能證實他們觸犯公職人員行為失當的罪行。",
            "由於不能證實李卓人及梁家傑觸犯公職人員行為失當的罪行，所以也沒有合理的機會證實黎智英及Mark Herman Simon涉及公職人員行為失當有關的罪行（例如串謀）。",
            "此外，為了完整起見，案中也沒有足夠的證據證實上述人士觸犯其他刑事罪行。",
            "律政司決定不對上述人士提出檢控，是依據《檢控守則》和適用法律而作出的。",
            "律政司對上述案件的決定作出解釋，讓市民對這宗備受公眾關注的案件有全面和充分的了解。",
