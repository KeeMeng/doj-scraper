            "In response to media enquiries in respect of the cases involving Tsang Kin-chiu and seven police officers, a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) said the following today (October 15):",
            "Upon legal advice from the DoJ, the Police have earlier today charged Mr Tsang Kin-chiu and seven police officers in respect of certain incidents that took place on October 15, 2014.",
            "In the case of Mr Tsang, he was charged with one count of assaulting police officers in the due execution of their duties and four counts of resisting a police officer in the due execution of his duty, all contrary to section 36(b) of the Offences against the Person Ordinance, Cap 212 (OAPO).",
            "The said charge of assaulting police officers in the due execution of their duties alleges that at about 3.20am on October 15, 2014, Mr Tsang splashed liquid from a plastic container onto Lung Wo Road while he was on a planter at the embankment of the underpass on Lung Wo Road; as a result, a number of police officers were splashed with the liquid.",
            "Each of the said four counts of resisting a police officer alleges that Mr Tsang resisted the police officers in the execution of their duties when they subsequently came to apprehend him at or near the planter.",
            "As regards the seven police officers (namely, Chief Inspector Wong Cho-sing, Senior Inspector Lau Cheuk-ngai, Detective Sergeant Pak Wing-bun, Police Constable Lau Hing-pui, Detective Police Constable Chan Siu-tan, Detective Police Constable Kwan Ka-ho and Detective Police Constable Wong Wai-ho), they were charged with one joint count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, contrary to section 17 of the OAPO. Further, Detective Police Constable Chan Siu-tan was charged with one additional count of common assault, contrary to common law and punishable under section 40 of the OAPO.",
            "The said joint charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent alleges that the said seven police officers unlawfully and maliciously caused grievous bodily harm to Mr Tsang, with intent to do him grievous bodily harm, outside the Lung Wui Road Government Building Pump Station East Substation, at about 3.30am on October 15, 2014.",
            "The said charge of common assault alleges that after Mr Tsang had been taken to the Central Police Station, he was assaulted by Detective Police Constable Chan Siu-tan inside an interview room in the police station.",
            "All the persons involved (i.e. Mr Tsang and the said seven police officers) were charged on the same day in order that they can be brought before court on the same day (i.e. October 19), so that the parties in both cases may have the opportunity to address the court, should they or their legal representatives see fit to do so, on any matters they think relevant and appropriate.",
            "The police officers whom Mr Tsang had allegedly assaulted are different from the seven police officers who had allegedly assaulted Mr Tsang. The assaults, though proximate in time, were in fact different. The DoJ, having duly taken into account all the relevant considerations, has concluded that: (1) there is sufficient evidence to warrant the commencement of the said prosecution; and (2) further, the public interest requires both Mr Tsang and the seven police officers to be prosecuted for their alleged respective conduct. The trials against Mr Tsang and the seven police officers will however be held separately. The former will be tried in the Magistrates' Courts, whereas the latter will be tried in the District Court.",
            "The decisions to lay the above-mentioned charges were made by the DoJ after it had carefully considered the applicable law, the relevant evidence, the Prosecution Code, and the independent advice that the DoJ has obtained from a local Senior Counsel and an overseas Queen's Counsel. Since judicial proceedings have already been commenced and with a view to avoiding any prejudice to the forthcoming trial, the DoJ will not make any further comment on these proceedings.",

            "就傳媒查詢涉及曾健超及七名警員的案件，律政司發言人今日（十月十五日）回應如下：",
            "在獲得律政司的法律意見後，警方於今日較早時候就二○一四年十月十五日發生的事件落案起訴曾健超及七名警員。",
            "曾健超被控一項襲擊正在執行職務的警務人員罪，及四項抗拒正在執行職務的警務人員罪；該五項控罪均違反香港法例第212章《侵害人身罪條例》第36（b）條。",
            "上述襲擊正在執行職務的警務人員的控罪，指於二○一四年十月十五日約上午三時二十分，曾健超在龍和道隧道頂花槽上，將膠樽內的液體潑向龍和道，令多名警員因而被液體潑中。",
            "另外四項的抗拒正在執行職務的警務人員的控罪，各指曾健超抗拒其後在花槽上和花槽附近制服他的警員。",
            "而七名警員（即總督察黃祖成、高級督察劉卓毅、偵緝警長白榮斌、警員劉興沛、偵緝警員陳少丹、偵緝警員關嘉豪及偵緝警員黃偉豪），他們共同被控一項有意圖而導致身體受嚴重傷害罪，違反《侵害人身罪條例》第17條。此外，偵緝警員陳少丹亦被控一項普通襲擊罪，違反普通法並可根據《侵害人身罪條例》第40條予以懲處。",
            "上述的有意圖而導致身體受嚴重傷害罪的控罪，指於二○一四年十月十五日約上午三時三十分，該七名警員在龍匯道政府大廈泵房東變電站外，意圖非法及惡意導致曾健超的身體受嚴重傷害。",
            "而上述的普通襲擊的控罪則指偵緝警員陳少丹在曾健超被帶返中區警署後，在一個會面室內襲擊曾健超。",
            "警方於同日起訴所有上述人士（即曾健超及該七名警員），並會將兩宗案件同日（即十月十九日）於法院提堂，從而令兩宗案件的有關人士或其法律代表能夠就他們認為相關及適當的事宜向法庭作陳述。",
            "曾健超涉嫌襲擊的警員並不是涉嫌襲擊曾健超的七名警員。雖然兩宗襲擊事發時間相近，但為不同事件。律政司在小心和全面考慮所有相關因素後得出以下結論：（一）有充分證據支持提出上述檢控；及（二）就曾健超及七名警員各自涉嫌的行為提出檢控符合公眾利益。涉及曾健超及涉及七名警員的兩宗審訊將會分開進行，前者會於裁判法院審理，後者則會於區域法院審理。",
            "律政司是在小心和全面考慮適用法律、相關證據和《檢控守則》，以及本地資深大律師和海外御用大律師提供的獨立法律意見後，作出上述的檢控決定。由於已展開司法程序，為免將來的聆訊受到任何不必要的不當影響，律政司不適宜就本案作進一步評論。",
