            "The Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, and the Executive Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Mr Shen Deyong, signed an arrangement on reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil judgments in matrimonial and family cases today (June 20).",
            "The Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Civil Judgments in Matrimonial and Family Cases by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) (the Arrangement) aims to ensure that parties in the HKSAR and the Mainland can enforce relevant civil judgments in matrimonial and family cases through a clear and effective legal regime.",
            "Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mr Yuen said that the negotiation and signing of the Arrangement once again demonstrates that the differences between the two places' legal systems are no obstacle to co-operation, if both sides can foster mutual understanding and mutual respect in accordance with the spirit of the \"one country, two systems\" policy.",
            "\"Not only is the signing of the Arrangement today an important milestone in the context of mutual legal assistance between the two places, it is also the most recent example of the successful implementation of the Basic Law,\" he added.",
            "Mr Yuen said that in view of factors including the rising number of cross-boundary marriages and the increasing proportion of families having assets in both the Mainland and Hong Kong, different sectors in the two places generally agree that there is a pressing need to make an arrangement on reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil judgments in matrimonial and family cases. This is because such an arrangement can provide clearer legal protection for relevant family members, especially underage children, when problems arise from such marriages, and the parties' legal rights will not be prejudiced by cross-boundary factors or differences between the two legal systems.",
            "Speaking of the mutual legal assistance between the two places in civil and commercial matters since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Mr Yuen said the work can be broadly divided into two stages. During the first stage, three arrangements on civil and commercial matters between the two places have been put in place, namely the arrangements on mutual service of judicial documents, mutual enforcement of arbitral awards, and reciprocal enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters pursuant to choice of court agreements made between the parties concerned.",
            "He said that despite the significant role played by them, the three arrangements can no longer meet the demands arising from changes in the landscape. The mutual legal assistance between the two places in civil and commercial matters entered a new stage in March last year when the Supreme People's Court signed minutes with the Department of Justice (DoJ) agreeing to actively take forward works on three aspects.",
            "The first aspect is the Arrangement on Mutual Taking of Evidence in Civil and Commercial Matters, which was signed in December last year and which became effective on March 1 this year. The second area is the signing of the Arrangement today.",
            "He added, \"On the basis of the good co-operation between the two places, we will start work in respect of the third aspect. In order to expand the scope of recognition and enforcement of judgements on civil and commercial matters, we will study the feasibility of using a framework arrangement to further cover different types of court judgments on civil and commercial matters.\"",
            "Mr Yuen pointed out that there are differences between the legal and judicial systems of Hong Kong and those of the Mainland, but that does not mean that there cannot be effective mutual legal assistance.",
            "He said, \"The reasons are obvious. First, whether before or after China resumed exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Hong Kong has been conducting mutual legal assistance on civil and commercial matters with other jurisdictions pursuant to the laws of Hong Kong, including the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance (Cap 319). In the circumstances, and given that Hong Kong and the Mainland belong to the same country, developing mutual legal assistance between the two places is even more justified.",
            "\"Second, since China resumed exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, there has been increasing interaction between the Mainland and Hong Kong in contexts such as trade and people's livelihood. Accordingly, there is clearly a need to enhance mutual legal assistance so as to better safeguard the legal rights of parties of the two places.",
            "\"Third, not only is Hong Kong an international financial centre, it is also a platform for foreign companies to enter the Mainland market. Put shortly, Hong Kong is a close partner for Mainland enterprises to 'go global' and to 'attract foreign investment'. To maintain this unique role of Hong Kong, it is necessary to ensure effective mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters is in place between Hong Kong and the Mainland.\"",
            "The Arrangement signed today will cover orders on individual identity and relationships, maintenance orders, custody orders in respect of children and protection orders in cases involving domestic violence.",
            "After the signing ceremony, local legislative procedure will be commenced so as to implement the Arrangement. The DoJ will continue to maintain communication with all relevant sectors in the process.",

            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月二十日）與最高人民法院（最高法）常務副院長沈德咏簽署相互認可和執行婚姻家庭民事案件判決的安排。",
            "該項《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院相互認可和執行婚姻家庭民事案件判決的安排》（《安排》），旨在確保兩地當事人可通過明確及有效的法律機制執行相關婚姻家庭民事案件的判決。",
            "袁國強在簽署儀式上致辭時表示，《安排》的商討過程及簽訂，再一次證明只要兩地能夠依據「一國兩制」的精神，相互理解和相互尊重，兩地法律制度的差異不會構成共同協作的障礙。",
            "他說：「今天簽訂的《安排》，不但是兩地司法協助方面一個重要的里程碑，也是《基本法》得到成功落實的最新例子。」",
            "袁國強說，鑑於跨境婚姻越來越普遍，以及家庭在内地與香港均有資產的情況不斷上升等因素，兩地不同界別也普遍認為有迫切的需要就相互認可和執行婚姻家事案件判決訂立安排，因爲安排能夠在婚姻出現問題時為相關家庭成員，特別是未成年的子女，提供更確定的法律保障，避免跨境因素或兩地法律制度的差異影響到他們的法律權利。",
            "談到香港回歸以來兩地的民商事司法協助工作時，袁國強表示，有關工作大致可分為兩個階段。在第一階段期間，兩地在民商事方面達成三項安排，涉及相互委託送達司法文書、相互執行仲裁裁決和相互執行當事人民商事判決。",
            "他說，雖然它們發揮了重大的作用，但隨着環境的改變，這三項安排明顯不能夠滿足需求，並指出兩地的民商事司法協助的工作進入了新的階段。在去年三月，最高法與特區律政司簽訂會議紀要，雙方同意積極推進三方面的工作。",
            "首先，《民商事案件相互委託提取證據的安排》已在去年十二月簽訂，並在今年三月一日生效。第二方面就是今天簽訂的《安排》。",
            "他續說：「在兩地良好的合作基礎上，我們將開展第三方面的工作。為了擴大兩地民商事判決的認可和執行範圍，我們將研究採用框架安排的可行性，以涵蓋更多不同種類的民商事法院判決。」",
            "袁國強指出，香港的法律及司法制度與內地的相關制度存在相當的差異，但這不代表兩地不能夠進行有效的司法協助。",
            "他說：「原因很明顯，首先，無論在回歸之前、還是回歸之後，香港一直依據香港法律，包括香港法例第319章《外地判決（交互強制執行）條例》，與其他司法管轄區進行民商事司法協助。既然香港可以與其他地方進行司法協助，加上香港與內地同屬一個國家，兩地進行司法協助的理據就更充分。」",
            "「第二，回歸以來，內地與香港在經貿和民生等各方面的往來越來越頻繁。為了充分維護兩地當事人的法律權益，絶對有需要完善兩地之間的司法協助。」",
            "「第三，香港不單是國際金融中心，更是外商進入內地市場的平台。簡單的說，香港是內地企業『走出去』和『引進來』的緊密夥伴。要保持香港這個獨特角色，必須確保香港與內地之間能進行有效的民商事司法協助。」",
            "今日簽署的《安排》將涵蓋針對個人身分、關係的命令、關於贍養的命令、就子女作出的管養命令，以及保護家庭暴力受害人的命令等。",
            "簽署儀式後，將進入本地立法程序，律政司在立法過程中將會繼續與各界保持緊密聯繫。",
