            "Following are the speaking notes of the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, tabled at the Finance Committee special meeting in the Legislative Council today (March 31):",
            "Chairman and Members,",
            "The total estimated expenditure of the Department of Justice (DoJ) for 2014-15 amounts to $1,795.2 million, representing an increase of 29.3 per cent (or $406.3 million) over the revised estimated expenditure for 2013-14. This increase is mainly due to the filling of vacancies which previously could not be filled, and the creation of 35 posts to cope with increasing demand from government departments for legal services. We also expect an increase in court costs and in the amount of fees payable to briefing-out solicitors, barristers and other professionals (such as expert witnesses) in private practice, and hence have made a provision of $379.8 million and $470 million respectively in 2014-15 to provide the necessary support for the anticipated legal proceedings and related matters.",
            "The amount to be spent on court costs and briefing-out depends on the number of cases involved, their complexity and the development of the cases. The current estimated expenditure was worked out mainly on the basis of the anticipated progress of the cases, but the actual expenditure would ultimately depend on the development and outcome of the cases concerned. Although these factors are not entirely within the control of the Government, we will observe the principle of economy appropriately and exercise prudence in controlling the relevant expenditure, subject to the consideration that the quality of service provided by DoJ shall not be compromised.",
            "I will now outline the DoJ's work in the new financial year.",
            "Regarding prosecutions, we will further enhance the standards of advocacy and case preparation, as well as the quality of prosecutions service, while continuing to promote cross-border co-operation amongst prosecutors in the combat of crime. At the same time, we will strive to enhance the public's understanding of the criminal justice system.",
            "Moreover, the Prosecutions Division will implement various measures with a view to modernising the Division and enhancing its efficiency. Last year, we published a completely new Prosecution Code. We also established co-ordinators or specific units for particular types of cases so that prosecutions could be handled more effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, we continued to provide various continuous trainings for our in-house prosecutors, and organised the biannual Joint Training Programme in conjunction with the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong for new lawyers in private practice. Apart from active participation in fora and events organised by international prosecuting organisations, we hosted the 12th Heads of Prosecuting Agencies Conference last year. Over 40 heads of prosecution agencies or their representatives from different places participated in the conference, during which they jointly examined the challenges of modern prosecutions work.",
            "Given the success of the conferences on criminal law held in the past two years, such conferences will become one of our annual feature events. In 2014, we will also embark on a \"Meet the Community\" programme, whereby we will arrange for prosecutors of the DoJ to visit schools and community institutions to give talks to enhance the public's understanding of the criminal justice system and their appreciation of the importance of the rule of law.",
            "The Civil Division will continue to provide legal advice to all government bureaux and departments on civil matters, assist in the drafting of relevant documents and contracts, and represent the Government in civil litigation and dispute resolution proceedings. We anticipate the number of applications for judicial review will remain at a high level, covering a wider area, and involving legal issues of increasing complexity. Provision of legal advice and litigation support to the Government on the related matters will remain one of the major tasks of the Division.",
            "On the other hand, the Mediation Team of the Civil Division will continue to assist the Steering Committee on Mediation set up in late 2012 in further promoting the wider use and development of mediation in Hong Kong. The Steering Committee held just now a \"Mediation Week\" from March 20 to 27, with various activities including a 2-day mediation conference under the theme \"Mediate First for a Win-Win Solution\". Different sectors of the community participated actively in the event. We have also produced a new Announcement in Public Interest on mediation with both video and audio clips so as to enhance the public's understanding of mediation. The Steering Committee will continue to take forward various tasks, including detailed study of the possible need for an apology legislation, and consideration of ways to collect mediation data for the purpose of monitoring the operation of the Mediation Ordinance. In addition, apart from organising mediation training for Government Counsel in DoJ, the Mediation Team will continue to conduct a number of mediation seminars, workshops and experience sharing sessions for civil servants in conjunction with the Civil Service Bureau so as to promote mediation within Government.",
            "In respect of legal policy, in line with the principal function of DoJ to uphold the rule of law and justice, we will continue to provide legal advice to the Government in respect of the Basic Law, human rights and other constitutional issues so as to ensure that all legislation proposed, and actions taken, by the Government are consistent with the Basic Law and other legal requirements.",
            "We will also continue to co-ordinate and actively participate in the work of two working groups set up to study the protection of the legal rights of transsexual persons and class actions respectively, so as to facilitate the two working groups to submit their recommendations on these two complex topics to the Government.",
            "On legislative work, we will introduce the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill and the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill into the Legislative Council in order to improve the existing law concerned. To implement the Law Reform Commission's Report on Enduring Powers of Attorney: Personal Care, we will prepare a bill for public consultation.",
            "We will actively consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region. Specifically, we will continue to work with the legal profession and arbitration institutions to promote the legal and arbitration services of Hong Kong in the Mainland and overseas. Further to the promotion events held in different places earlier, the DoJ will organise the Hong Kong Legal Services Forum and a conference on arbitration in Shandong Province this September.",
            "Furthermore, we plan to establish an Advisory Committee on Promotion of Arbitration to advise on and co-ordinate the development and promotion of Hong Kong's international arbitration services. Members will include representatives of the Government and related sectors. We will also conduct a study on the development of and prospects for arbitration in Hong Kong, as well as the challenges and opportunities that Hong Kong faces as a regional centre for international arbitration in the Asia Pacific region.",
            "In the coming year, the Law Drafting Division will gear its work towards the legislative programme of the Government in drafting various pieces of important legislation to facilitate the implementation of the relevant policies as scheduled.",
            "Apart from reflecting policy intent accurately and effectively, making statutory provisions easy to read and comprehend will remain to be an important work objective of the Law Drafting Division. In this connection, we will step up training for law drafters to enhance the quality of drafting, and develop and improve expertise and skills in respect of bilingual law drafting in Hong Kong.",
            "My colleagues in the Law Drafting Division are pressing ahead with the establishment of a new electronic database of legislation with legal status. We have just completed the system analysis and design stage for phase 1.",
            "In the coming year, the International Law Division will continue with its work in the provision of advice on international law issues, negotiation of international agreements or participation as legal advisers in such negotiations, and handling of requests for international legal co-operation. We will also continue to handle and co-ordinate requests to and from the HKSAR concerning the surrender of fugitive offenders, transfer of sentenced persons, mutual legal assistance and international child abduction cases.",
            "In the past year, the International Law Division actively participated in the work of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, including support provided to the work of the Asia Pacific Regional Office of the Hague Conference in Hong Kong. In the coming year, we will continue with our efforts in this area and contribute to the work of the Hague Conference to promote and strengthen international co-operation.",
            "The above sets out the major work of DoJ in the coming financial year. My colleagues and I will be pleased to take questions from Members and listen to your views.",
            "Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師提交予今日（三月三十一日）的立法會財務委員會特別會議介紹法律行政的書面發言稿件全文︰",
            "主席、各位委員︰",
            "律政司在二○一四至一五年度的總預算開支為17億9千520萬元，較二○一三至一四年度的修訂預算開支增加29.3%（即4億630萬元）。預算開支上升，主要是由於填補過去未能填補的職位空缺，以及增設35個新職位以應付各政府部門對法律服務需求的增長。我們亦預期訴訟費用及向私人執業律師、大律師及其他專業人士（例如專家證人）支付的外判案件開支會有所增加，因此在二○一四至一五年度分別預留了3億7千980萬元和4億7千萬元，為預期的訴訟及相關法律事宜提供必要的支援。",
            "訴訟費用及外判案件的開支金額，視乎相關案件的數目、複雜程度和發展而定。我們現時的開支預算主要根據案件的預期進展而制訂，但實際開支最終則取決於有關案件的發展和結果。雖然這些因素並非完全由當局控制，但我們會適度節約，在不影響律政司提供優質服務的大前提下，謹慎控制有關開支。",
            "以下我會簡述律政司在新一個財政年度的主要工作。",
            "在刑事檢控方面，我們會進一步提升訟辯和籌備工作的水平，及提高刑事檢控服務的質素，並在打擊罪行方面繼續推動跨境檢控人員之間的合作，同時會致力加深市民對刑事司法制度的認識。",
            "此外，刑事檢控科將推展各項不同的措施，務求提升效率，與時並進。去年，我們公布全新的《檢控守則》。我們亦為指定類別的案件設立協調人員或特定組別，令檢控工作的處理可以更有效快捷。我們又繼續為部門檢控人員提供持續培訓，並一年兩次聯同香港大律師公會及香港律師會為新晉私人執業大律師或律師安排聯合培訓計劃。除了積極參與國際檢控組織舉辦的論壇和活動外，我們亦於去年主辦第十二屆檢察機關首長會議。有超過40名來自不同地方的檢控機關首長或代表出席該會議，共同探討當今刑事檢控工作的挑戰。",
            "由於過去兩年舉辦的刑事法律研討會成效理想，我們會將該研討會納入我們每年舉辦的重點活動之一。我們亦會在二○一四年推展名為「與公眾會面」的計劃，安排律政司的檢控人員到學校及社區機構舉行講座，從而加深市民對刑事司法制度和法治重要性的了解。",
            "民事法律科將繼續向政府各決策局和部門就民事法律事宜提供法律意見、協助草擬相關文件和合約、並代表政府處理民事訴訟及解決爭議的程序。預計司法覆核的申請宗數將維持在高水平，涉及的範圍會更加廣泛，而爭議的法律觀點亦會越趨複雜。就相關事宜向政府提供法律意見和訴訟支援，會繼續是民事法律科的一項主要工作。",
            "民事法律科轄下的「調解小組」則會繼續協助於二○一二年年底成立的「調解督導委員會」，進一步提倡在香港更廣泛使用和發展調解服務。委員會剛於本月二十至二十七日舉行了「調解周」，活動包括為期兩天以「調解為先、互利雙贏」為題的調解研討會，得到各界人士踴躍參與。我們亦全新製作關於調解的宣傳短片及聲帶，以加深公眾對調解的認識。委員會將持續展開多項工作，包括就是否需要引入道歉法例進行詳細研究，以及考慮如何蒐集調解數據以監察《調解條例》的實施情況。此外，除了為司內的政府律師提供調解訓練外，「調解小組」會繼續與公務員事務局合辦多個為公務員而設的調解研討會、研習班和經驗交流會，以在政府內部推動調解。",
            "在法律政策方面，我們會繼續配合律政司維護法治及公義的主要職能，就《基本法》、人權及其他政制事宜，向政府提供法律意見，以確保政府提出的所有立法建議和所採取的措施，均符合《基本法》及其他法律要求。",
            "我們亦會繼續統籌及積極參與為研究保障變性人士的法律權利及集體訴訟而設立的兩個工作小組的工作，以便工作小組能就這兩個複雜議題向政府當局提交建議。",
            "在立法工作方面，我們會在立法會引入《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》及《成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》，以改善現行的有關法律。為落實法律改革委員會發表的《持久授權書︰個人照顧事宜》報告書，我們會擬備條例草案，以便進行公眾諮詢。",
            "我們會積極鞏固和提升香港作為亞太區主要國際法律及解決爭議服務中心的地位。具體而言，我們會繼續與法律專業及仲裁機構合作，在內地與海外推廣香港的法律及仲裁服務。繼先前在各地的推廣活動，律政司並會於本年九月在山東省舉辦香港法律及解決爭議服務研討會。",
            "此外，我們計劃設立一個仲裁諮詢委員會，成員包括政府及業界的代表，就香港在國際仲裁服務方面的發展及推廣，提供意見及作出協調。我們亦會進行一項研究，探討仲裁在香港的發展及前景，以及香港作為亞太區國際仲裁中心的挑戰和機遇。",
            "法律草擬科來年會配合政府的立法計劃，草擬多項重要法例，令相關政策得以如期推展。",
            "除準確有效地反映政策用意外，法例條文易於閱讀理解，亦會繼續是法律草擬科的重要工作目標。就此，我們會加強培訓草擬人員，提升草擬質素，發展和完善香港的雙語法律草擬專門知識和技巧。",
            "法律草擬科的同事，亦正在推進建立新的具法律地位的法例電子資料庫的工作。我們剛剛完成新電子資料庫計劃第一期的系統分析和設計工作。",
            "國際法律科來年會繼續就國際法律事宜提供法律意見、就國際協議進行談判工作或在談判中擔當法律顧問，以及處理國際司法合作的請求。我們亦會繼續處理和統籌由香港特區提出和所收到的有關移交逃犯及被判刑人士、司法互助及國際擄拐兒童個案的請求。",
            "過去一年，國際法律科一直積極參與海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）的工作，包括支持海牙會議在香港的亞太區域辦事處的工作。在未來一年，我們會繼續這方面的努力，協助海牙會議推動和加強國際合作。",
            "主席，以上是律政司在新的財政年度的主要工作。我和我的同事會樂意解答各位委員的問題和聽取大家的意見。",
            "多謝各位。",
