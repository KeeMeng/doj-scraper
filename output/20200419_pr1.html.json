            "In response to certain media reports and local and overseas comments made concerning the arrest and prosecution of a number of persons for organising and participating in unauthorised assemblies, a Government spokesman reiterated that investigations by law enforcement agencies and prosecutions by the Department of Justice (DoJ) are carried out in strict accordance with the law.",
            "\"Under section 10 of the Police Force Ordinance, the Police have the duty to take lawful measures to arrest persons based on sufficient evidence and according to the laws in force. The Police are duty bound to handle every case in a fair, just and impartial manner,\" the spokesman said.",
            "\"Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that 'the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference.' The prosecutors have always been discharging this constitutional duty independently and professionally, without fear or favour. No one should interfere or attempt to interfere with independent prosecutorial decisions which are based on an objective assessment of all admissible evidence and applicable laws, made strictly in accordance with the Prosecution Code which is available to the public,\" the spokesman added.",
            "As the Secretary for Justice has explained on many occasions, the Prosecution Code of the DoJ provides clear, consistent guidelines and principles for carrying out prosecution work. It is the responsibility of the prosecutors to apply the highest of professional standards in handling all criminal cases. A prosecutor must not be influenced by any investigatory, political, media, community or individual interest or representation. All prosecutorial decisions are based on admissible evidence, applicable laws and the Prosecution Code, without political consideration. Cases will not be handled any differently owing to the political beliefs or background of the persons involved. Prosecutions would only be commenced if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction.",
            "\"The HKSAR Government always respects and protects human rights and freedoms. However, these rights are not absolute. As pointed out by the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2020, \"it is important to understand that the enjoyment of these rights has limits so as not to affect adversely to an unacceptable level the enjoyment by other members of their community of their rights and liberties\".",
            "As legal proceedings are on-going, it is inappropriate for anyone to comment on the cases as it would create a public discussion which may amount to a trial by the public. No one should embark upon baseless speculations. These types of accusations may be perceived as purporting to influence the proper discharge of public duties,\" the spokesman said.",
            "The rule of law is a core value in Hong Kong. Any unfair and unfounded allegation made with a view to undermining and discrediting our independent criminal justice system is vehemently refuted.",

            "回應有關多名涉嫌組織及參與未經批准集結的人士被拘捕及檢控的報道及本地和海外評論，政府發言人重申執法機關的調查工作和律政司的檢控工作均是嚴格按照法律進行。",
            "發言人表示：「根據《警隊條例》第10條，警隊有責任採取合法措施以拘捕一切可合法拘捕而又有足夠理由予以拘捕的人。警隊亦有責任以公平、公正及不偏不倚的態度處理每一宗案件。」",
            "發言人續說：「《基本法》第六十三條訂明：『香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉。』律政司的檢控人員一直獨立並專業地履行這個憲制責任，無畏無懼。檢控決定基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析，並嚴格按照公開的《檢控守則》而作出，任何人均不應干涉或企圖干涉獨立的檢控決定。」",
            "律政司司長曾多次在不同場合解釋，《檢控守則》為檢控工作提供清晰並貫徹的指引和原則。以最高的專業水平處理所有刑事案件，是檢控人員的責任。檢控人員不得受任何涉及調查、政治、傳媒、社群或個人的利益或陳述的因素影響。所有檢控決定是按可接納證據、適用法律和《檢控守則》而作出，不會有任何政治考慮。案件不會因涉案人士的政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同，律政司在有充分可被法院接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪的情況下，才會提出起訴。",
            "香港特別行政區政府一向尊重和保障人權和自由，但該等權利並非絕對。正如終審法院首席法官在二○二○年法律年度開啟典禮上指出：「為使社會上其他人的權利和自由不會受到不可接受的影響，行使這些權利需要有限制。明白這一點是重要的。」",
            "發言人指出，由於相關案件已進入司法程序，任何人均不宜對此作出評論，以免引起公開討論，可能構成公審。任何人都不應作出毫無根據的揣測，這類指控或會被視為企圖影響我們妥善地執行公職。",
            "法治是香港的核心價值。任何不公和失實的指控，以損害和詆毀我們的刑事司法制度，必須強烈反駁。",
