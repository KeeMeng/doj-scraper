            "Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in moving the second reading of the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 at the Legislative Council meeting today (June 14):",
            "Mr President,",
            "I move that the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 be read the second time.",
            "It has been the practice of the Department of Justice to introduce, at regular intervals, to the Legislative Council a Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, proposing minor amendments that are largely technical and non-controversial to various Ordinances for the purpose of updating or further enhancing the relevant legislation.",
            "The last Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was enacted in 2014. The Government finds it necessary to introduce another omnibus bill so as to make miscellaneous amendments to various Ordinances. The amendments are set out in Parts 2 to 9 of the Bill. The key elements can be outlined as follows.",
            "Part 2 of the Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Ordinance and the Live Television Link and Video Recorded Evidence Rules to give the court a discretion to permit complainants of specified sexual offences to give evidence in proceedings by way of a live television link, in order to enhance the protection for such complainants.",
            "Part 3 of the Bill seeks to clarify the powers of temporary registrars of different ranks appointed to the High Court, the District Court and the Competition Tribunal. The amendments concerned are proposed by the Judiciary for the sake of clarity. Through the amendments, temporary registrars appointed to such courts and tribunal will be given the same jurisdiction and powers of the registrars at the respective ranks.",
            "Parts 4 and 8 of the Bill seek to amend the District Court Ordinance. The amendments are also proposed by the Judiciary. Part 4 seeks to provide for representation of the Secretary for Justice at the District Court Rules Committee, while the amendment in Part 8 seeks to enable the jurisdiction limit of the amount of claim for costs in \"costs-only proceedings\" may be amended by resolution of the Legislative Council. Both these amendments aim to align the practice in question with other similar arrangements.",
            "Part 5 of the Bill seeks to clarify the reference point for the calculation of the period of residence for the purpose of admission as a solicitor in Hong Kong in response to the proposal of the Law Society of Hong Kong. With this amendment, a person is required to have resided in Hong Kong for at least three months immediately before the date on which the person applied for a certificate of eligibility for admission, but not the date of the applicant's admission as a solicitor as it currently stands.",
            "Part 6 of the Bill amends the English text of the Mainland Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance by replacing the references to \"Basic People's Court(s)\" in the Mainland therein by \"Primary People's Court(s)\" so as to maintain consistency with the English usage of the same term in the Mainland, and thereby avoiding confusion of the meaning of the relevant term.",
            "Part 7 of the Bill amends the Laws (Loose-leaf Publication) Ordinance 1990 and the Legislation Publication Ordinance to streamline laws compilation and editorial amendment work.",
            "Part 9 of the Bill contains miscellaneous and technical amendments to various legislative provisions for different purposes, including to reinstate consequential amendments that were omitted in previous legislative amendment exercises, to formally repeal legislation that has ceased to have effect, to remove obsolete references to repealed provisions from certain legal provisions, to achieve consistency in certain expressions, to update a reference to the title of an item of subsidiary legislation, and to make provisions for correcting other minor errors.",
            "Mr President, as I pointed out at the beginning of this speech, the Bill deals with a number of amendments to various areas in a consolidated manner, which is part of the continuing efforts of the Government to collate Hong Kong's legislation. By dealing with the amendments in one go by way of the Bill, the relevant legislative provisions can be further improved in an efficient manner.",
            "With these remarks, I urge Members to support the Bill.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月十四日）在立法會會議上動議二讀《2017年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "主席：",
            "我謹動議二讀《2017年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》（條例草案）。",
            "律政司過去每隔一段時間都會向立法會提交《成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》，就不同範疇的法例提出一些大致上屬於技術性和無爭議的輕微修訂，從而更新或進一步完善相關法例。",
            "上一條的《成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》在二○一四年制定。時至今日，政府認為有需要提交另一條綜合條例草案，以對若干條例作出雜項修訂。有關修訂載於《條例草案》第2至9部，當中主要內容可簡述如下。",
            "《條例草案》第2部的目的，是透過修訂《刑事訴訟程序條例》及《電視直播聯繫及錄影紀錄證據規則》，賦予法庭酌情決定權，准許指明性罪行的申訴人可在相關法律程序中透過電視直播聯繫方式作供，以加強對這些申訴人的保護。",
            "《條例草案》第3部的目的，是為了釐清高等法院、區域法院和競爭事務審裁處各職級暫委司法常務官的權力。有關修訂是因應司法機構的建議，為使法例更為清晰。透過該修訂，這些法院及審裁處各職級暫委司法常務官將獲賦予相應職級的司法常務官所持的相同司法管轄權及權力。",
            "《條例草案》第4部和第8部同樣是因應司法機構的建議，修訂《區域法院條例》。第4部的目的是為了讓區域法院規則委員會將有律政司司長的代表。而第8部的修訂是為了使「只涉訟費的法律程序」中司法管轄權限的訟費申索數額，可以透過立法會決議修訂。兩項修訂均旨在令有關做法與其他類似安排一致。",
            "《條例草案》第5部的目的，是因應香港律師會的建議，釐清計算申請在香港獲認許為律師的居住期間的參考點。經修訂後，申請人在緊接其符合資格獲認許為律師的證明書申請表上的日期之前，而非現時申請人獲認許為律師的日期之前，須已在香港居住至少三個月。",
            "《條例草案》第6部修訂《內地判決（交互強制執行）條例》英文文本中有關內地「基層人民法院」的提述所用的英文名稱，以「Primary People's Court(s)」取代「Basic People's Court(s)」，使用與內地對應英文名稱一致的表述，以避免混淆相關名稱的涵義。",
            "《條例草案》第7部修訂《1990年法例（活頁版）條例》及《法例發布條例》，以精簡法例編訂和編輯修訂的工作。",
            "《條例草案》第9部載有因應不同目的，對多項法例條文，作出雜項及技術性修訂，包括填補在過往修訂各項法例時遺漏的相應修訂、正式廢除已失效的法例、從部分法例條文中刪除對已廢除條文的過時提述、統一若干詞句的表述、更新對一項附屬法例名稱的提述，以及更正其他輕微的錯誤。",
            "主席，正如我在開始發言時指出，《條例草案》綜合處理多項不同範疇的修訂，是政府為整理香港法例而持續進行的其中一項工作。透過《條例草案》一併處理各項修訂，可有效率地進一步改善相關的法律條文。",
            "我謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持《條例草案》。",
            "多謝主席。",
