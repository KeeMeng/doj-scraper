            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, today (March 31) after attending the Finance Committee special meeting in the Legislative Council (LegCo):",
            "Reporter: How is the extradition thing with Macau progressing now and how long will it take before we can have some kind of treaty or agreement with them? And secondly can I ask you about the Donald Tsang and Timothy Tong cases? Why did it take so long to bring it to prosecution or deciding what to do with it?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Maybe I'll recap what I have said in Cantonese just now very briefly in English. In so far as the surrender of fugitives, perhaps if I may clarify the word \"extradition\" is not most appropriate in the context between Hong Kong and Macau. In the context of mutual legal assistance in the criminal context, including the surrender of fugitives, we have been working on it. And in fact recently there have been working conferences between working levels of Hong Kong and Macau's Department of Justice. We hope we can finish the documents on the arrangement as soon as possible. The normal working procedure would be for Hong Kong and Macau to agree on the agreement setting out the arrangement. And then, based on that agreement, we would respectively embark upon our legislative process, which means in the case of Hong Kong, as in the other situations where we deal with return or surrender of fugitives, we would come to LegCo to work on the legislative progress.",
            "In relation to your second question, that is the case concerning ICAC's investigation of Mr Donald Tsang and Mr Timothy Tong, as I was saying at the meeting just now, the investigations are being carried out by ICAC. The responsibility of the Department of Justice is to provide legal advice from time to time or as and when requested by ICAC. The matter is still currently under investigation and therefore, as in other cases, I am not at liberty to disclose or divulge the details. But I can assure everyone that there is no political interference, nor would the Department of Justice take into account any political consideration. In fact, we will strictly follow our discharge of constitutional duty under Basic Law Article 63 to deal with the situation strictly in accordance with law, strictly in accordance with our Prosecution Code and not to take into account any unnecessary or undue influence.",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（三月三十一日）出席立法會財務委員會特別會議後與記者的談話內容︰",
            "記者︰與澳門移交逃犯的協議現時進度如何？大概幾時可以簽署協議並提交立法會？例如就最近的劉鑾雄案，能否趕及在完成程序後將他移交？",
            "律政司司長︰首先，我不方便就個別的刑事案件作出評論。但就這方面的工作，我了解傳媒朋友和社會人士都關注。正如我剛才在開會的時候都有提到，自我上任後，亦有就這件事開始與澳門的相關當局提出商討。實際工作進展詳情，我不方便透露太多細節，可以說的是，雙方已經在工作層面舉行過不止一次會議，而且在去年和今年都有舉行會議，未來短期內仍會有工作層面的會議，有可能有更高層的會面。實際的進展現階段我不方便給予時間表，但因為我們明白澳門和香港兩地市民都關注這件事，我們都希望盡快全力積極處理這件事。就工作安排方面，首先要香港和澳門就安排內容的文本有協定，協定達成後，各自會在香港和澳門的立法會進行相關立法工作。這做法和香港特區與其他司法管轄區就刑事司法互助，包括移交逃犯的模式和工作進程一樣，並無特別因為是澳門而採取另一個方法，而是根據以往一貫做法。換言之，在剛才我說的工序完成，即雙方就文本達成一致協議後，我們下一步的工作是就相關文本內容向立法會提交，然後開展立法工作，我相信暫時無法給予一個特定時間。",
            "記者：大概甚麼時候完成？",
            "律政司司長︰我想也要再看看下一步的工作進展。",
            "記者︰有建制派議員提出個人方案，設兩重關卡選行政長官候選人，先取十分一的提名，之後再取一半提名委員會的支持才能成為候選人。會不會覺得這個方案可以接受？或者是關卡太多？",
            "律政司司長：多謝你的問題。正如我們去年十二月四日正式展開諮詢時都說得很清楚，在諮詢期間，我們的目的是希望盡量聽，我們不會就個別具體的方案或建議作出具體回應，過往對其他人士的建議是這樣做，今次我們對這個建議亦是用同樣的處理方法。不好意思，暫時不能透露我們的看法。",
