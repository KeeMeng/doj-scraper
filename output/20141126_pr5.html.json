            "Following is the translation of a speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, on the resumption of the Second Reading debate on the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 in the Legislative Council meeting today (November 26):",
            "Mr President,",
            "Since the introduction of the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 (the Bill) into the Legislative Council in April this year, four Bills Committee meetings have been held. The Bills Committee chaired by the Hon Tam Yiu-chung has thoroughly examined the clauses and the issues involved. I would like to express my gratitude to the Hon Tam Yiu-chung and all the members of the Bills Committee for their hard work and valuable opinions.",
            "As I pointed out when introducing the Bill into the Legislative Council, the Bill seeks to propose technical and, in our view, non-controversial amendments to various Ordinances for the purpose of updating or improving the relevant existing legislation. The Bill comprises 15 parts and deals with miscellaneous amendments proposed by bureaux and the Department of Justice (DoJ) in a consolidated manner.",
            "The proposed amendments in the Bill fall roughly into three categories. The first category of amendments are those proposed by the relevant bureaux in the light of court rulings, including amendments to certain sexual offence provisions in the Crimes Ordinance and certain defence provisions in the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.",
            "The second category of amendments in the Bill aim to implement proposals put forward by individual bodies/organisations. They include: (1) the various miscellaneous amendments to the four anti-discrimination ordinances proposed by the Equal Opportunities Commission; (2) the amendments to the Evidence Ordinance suggested by the Hong Kong Society of Notaries relating to admissibility of notarial instruments; (3) the amendments to section 8A of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance in response to the Law Society of Hong Kong's proposals; and (4) the amendments to section 7 and Schedule 2 of the Building Management Ordinance so as to implement one of the proposals of the Interim Report of the Review Committee on the Building Management Ordinance.",
            "The third category concerns miscellaneous and technical amendments to various ordinances or subsidiary legislation proposed for different purposes mainly by the DoJ and other relevant bureaux.",
            "I will be moving some amendments at the Committee Stage later. These amendments have all been agreed by the Bills Committee and can be grouped into the following six categories which I will outline briefly below.",
            "Amendment to Clause 43 of Part 4",
            "Clause 43 proposes to amend section 81 of the Evidence Ordinance (Cap. 8). However, after the gazettal of the Bill, amendments to section 81 of the Evidence Ordinance have also been proposed under clause 13 of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2014. The Competition (Amendment) Bill was passed before the Bill and gazetted as an Ordinance on November 21. With reference to the latest version of section 81 of the Evidence Ordinance, I will propose a Committee Stage Amendment (CSA) to clause 43 of the Bill in order to ensure that the proposed amendments will be properly effected.",
            "Deletion of Part 10 (i.e. Clause 57)",
            "The proposed amendment in Part 10 of the Bill, which seeks to repeal item 29 of Schedule 1 to the Legal Services Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Ordinance 1997 (94 of 1997), was suggested by the Law Society of Hong Kong. The policy intent of the Law Society is to reinstate the law prior to the above 1997 Ordinance so that only solicitors or foreign lawyers could become trustees or co-trustees of a trust. In view of the views expressed by the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services, the Administration consulted the Law Society further on a number of occasions about their policy intent. The Law Society subsequently confirmed in May 2014 that as the proposed amendment in Part 10 might not achieve the intended objective, they would not pursue the proposed amendment. I will therefore move a CSA to delete Part 10 of the Bill.",
            "Amendment to Clause 63 of Part 12",
            "Having regard to the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) which has come into operation on March 3, 2014, I will propose a CSA to clause 63 to add the entry of \"Registrar of Companies\" specified for the purposes of the Companies Ordinance to the proposed Schedule to the Specification of Public Offices Notice (Note) (Cap. 1 sub. leg. C).",
            "Addition of Division 5 in Part 12 (with consequential amendment to Clause 1(2) and addition of Clause 1(5))",
            "To follow on a consequential amendment that was omitted in previous amendment exercise, the opportunity is taken to add the entry of \"Secretary for Home Affairs\" specified for the purposes of the Books Registration Ordinance (Cap. 142) to the existing Specification of Public Offices (Cap. 1 sub. leg. C) by way of CSA. The amendment is deemed to have come into operation on April 9, 1998.",
            "Addition of Divisions 47A and 47B and replacement of Division 53 by the new Divisions 53 to 55 in Part 14",
            "After the gazettal of the Bill, four new regulations have been enacted under section 3 of the United Nations Sanctions Ordinance (Cap. 537). I will propose CSAs to add the new Divisions 47A and 47B and to replace Division 53 by the new Divisions 53 to 55 in Part 14 in order to amend the definitions of Commissioner in the Chinese texts of the regulations concerned by removing the references to \"香港\" in \"香港海關關長\", \"香港海關副關長\" and \"香港海關助理關長\".",
            "Amendments to Clauses 1(3), 14(2), 48(3), 51, 52(2), 54, 64 and 68(2)(a)",
            "These technical amendments in the Bill seek to refine the provisions.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Mr President, with these remarks, I urge Members to support the second reading of the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 and endorse all the amendments to be moved by the Administration at the subsequent Committee Stage.",
            "Thank you, Mr President.",
            "Note: The current title of Cap. 1 sub. leg. C is \"Specification of Public Offices\". Clause 60 of the Bill proposes to amend the title to read as \"Specification of Public Offices Notice\".",

            "主席：",
            "今年四月，我向立法會提交《2014年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》之後，法案委員會已舉行四次會議。由譚耀宗議員擔任主席的法案委員會已詳細審議各項條款和涉及的問題。我謹在此衷心感謝譚耀宗議員及所有該法案委員會委員的努力和寶貴意見。",
            "正如我向立法會提交《條例草案》時指出，《條例草案》旨在就不同範疇的法例提出一些技術性及相信不會具爭議性的修訂，從而更新或改善相關現行法例。《條例草案》合共15部，綜合處理由多個政策局及律政司提出的多項修訂建議。",
            "《條例草案》中所載的修訂建議可概括地分為三類。第一類修訂是由相關的政策局因應法庭的裁決而提出的，當中包括修訂《刑事罪行條例》中關於性罪行的若干條文，以及修訂《商品說明條例》中若干免責辯護的條文。",
            "第二類修訂建議，是為了落實個別機構或團體的建議而提出。當中包括：（1）因應平等機會委員會的建議，就四條反歧視條例作出多項雜項修訂；（2）因應香港國際公證人協會的建議而修訂《證據條例》中有關公證文書的規定；（3）因應香港律師會的建議而修訂《法律執業者條例》第8A條；（4）為了落實《建築物管理條例》檢討委員會中期報告當中的一項建議而修訂《建築物管理條例》第7條及附表二。",
            "第三類修訂，則主要是律政司及其它有關政策局提出，因應不同目的而對多條條例或附屬法例作出雜項及技術性修訂。",
            "稍後，我會在全體委員會審議階段動議數項修正案。有關修訂全部均獲法案委員會同意，大致可分為以下六類，我現作簡單介紹。",
            "條例草案第43條建議修訂《證據條例》（第8章）第81條，但本條例草案刊登憲報之後，當局亦建議透過《2014年競爭（修訂）條例草案》第13條修訂《證據條例》第81條。《2014年競爭（修訂）條例草案》早前已獲得通過，並於本月二十一日在憲報刊登為條例。因應《證據條例》第81條的最新內容，我們需要就本條例草案第43條提出委員會審議階段修正案，從而處理相關建議修訂。",
            "條例草案第10部的建議修訂由香港律師會提出，目的是廢除《1997年法律服務立法（雜項修訂）條例》（1997年第94號）附表1第29項。律師會的政策原意是恢復上述《1997年條例》訂立前的法律，只有律師或外地律師可成為信託的受託人或共同受託人。因應司法及法律事務委員會的意見，當局就上述的政策原意多次諮詢律師會，律師會其後於二○一四年五月確定，第10部的修訂建議未必能達到原定的目標，不會繼續推動修訂建議。因此，我會動議委員會審議階段修正案，刪除條例草案第10部。",
            "因應已於二○一四年三月三日實施的《公司條例》（第622章），我將會提出委員會審議階段修正案，就條例草案第63條內的《公職指明公告》（註）（第1章，附屬法例C）擬議附表，加入為實施《公司條例》而指明「公司註冊處處長」的記項。",
            "為補回以往遺漏的相應修訂，現透過委員會審議階段修正案，在現行的《公職指定》（第1章，附屬法例C）中，加入為實施《書刊註冊條例》（第142章）而指明「民政事務局局長」的記項，並當作於一九九八年四月九日起實施。",
            "在本條例草案於憲報刊登之後，當局根據《聯合國制裁條例》（第537章）第3條訂立了四條新的規例。我將會提出委員會審議階段修正案，在第14部中加入第47A及47B分部，及以新的第53至55分部取代原來的第53分部，以修訂在該四條新的規例中的「關長」的定義，刪去在「香港海關關長」、「香港海關副關長」及「香港海關助理關長」中對「香港」的提述。",
