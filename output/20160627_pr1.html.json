            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) today (June 27) launched a seven-week public consultation regarding a proposed arrangement with the Mainland on reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments on matrimonial and related matters (the Proposed Arrangement).",
            "The proposal was made in response to issues arising from the increasing number of cross-boundary marriages, the substantial percentage of divorce cases filed in the Family Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in relation to marriages which took place in the Mainland, and the enhanced mobility of residents of both the HKSAR and the Mainland.",
            "Although the HKSAR and the Mainland concluded an arrangement on reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil judgments (REJ) in 2006, it is limited in scope and does not cover family matters.",
            "Furthermore, according to section 56 of the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap 179), a divorce granted by the Mainland court is recognised in the HKSAR. However, maintenance orders and custody orders granted by a Mainland court are not automatically recognised and enforceable in the HKSAR. The same applies to the recognition and enforcement in the Mainland of maintenance orders and custody orders granted by a court of the HKSAR.",
            "Under the current regime, parties to cross-boundary marriages would incur extra time and costs as well as suffer emotional distress in seeking to enforce in the HKSAR matrimonial judgments obtained in the courts of the Mainland, and vice versa.",
            "The DoJ noted that there have been calls for an extension of the REJ regime between the HKSAR and the Mainland, particularly in relation to matrimonial and related matters. It considers that the Proposed Arrangement would benefit judgment holders by providing a more expeditious and cost-effective way of seeking reciprocal recognition and enforcement in the HKSAR of judgments on matrimonial and related matters obtained in the Mainland, and vice versa.",
            "Specifically, the DoJ invites public views on the following issues:",
            "(a) the principal types of judgments (including divorce, maintenance and custody orders) to be covered in the Proposed Arrangement;",
            "(b) whether to include the \"divorce certificate\" obtained through the registration procedure in the Mainland in the Proposed Arrangement;",
            "(c) whether to include orders for property adjustment;",
            "(d) whether to include power of variation of maintenance orders by the courts in the place where the orders are sought to be enforced;",
            "(e) whether other orders should be included in the Proposed Arrangement;",
            "(f) the jurisdictional basis of the parties to an application for REJ;",
            "(g) the level of courts to be covered in the Proposed Arrangement; and",
            "(h) the finality of judgments.",
            "The consultation paper is now available on the website:",
            ". All submissions should be sent to China Law Unit, Legal Policy Division, Department of Justice, by mail to 5/F, East Wing, Justice Place, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central, Hong Kong; by fax to 3918 4799; or by email to",

            "律政司今日（六月二十七日）就香港特區與內地訂立相互認可和執行婚姻及相關事宜判決安排的建議（擬議《安排》）展開七個星期的公眾諮詢。",
            "有關建議是因應近年跨境婚姻的增加、在送交香港特區家事法庭存檔的離婚案件中內地結婚個案所佔的相當比例，以及兩地居民之間的流動性提高所引致的議題而提出的。",
            "雖然香港特區與內地在二○○六年已簽訂有關相互認可和執行民事判決（相互執行判決）的安排，但其涵蓋範圍有限，並不包括家庭事宜。",
            "此外，根據《婚姻訴訟條例》（第179章）第56條，香港特區承認內地法院批准的離婚。但內地法院發出的贍養令和管養令，不會在香港特區自動獲得承認和執行。香港特區法院發出的贍養令和管養令在內地的認可和執行情況亦是如此。",
            "在現行制度下，跨境婚姻雙方尋求在香港特區執行在內地法院取得的婚姻判決，或在內地執行於香港特區法院取得的婚姻判決，難免要多費時間和金錢，更須承受精神上的壓力。",
            "律政司留意到社會一直有聲音要求擴闊香港特區與內地相互執行判決的制度，特別是在婚姻及相關事宜方面。律政司認為若擬議《安排》得到落實，將可令取得判決者受惠，為他們提供更便捷和更具成本效益的途徑，藉以尋求在香港特區或內地相互認可和執行另一地的婚姻及相關事宜判決。",
            "具體而言，律政司邀請各方就以下事宜提出意見：",
            "（一）擬議《安排》應涵蓋的主要判決類別，包括離婚令、贍養令，以及管養令；",
            "（二）應否把通過登記程序在內地取得的「離婚證」納入擬議《安排》的涵蓋範圍；",
            "（三）應否把財產調整的命令納入涵蓋範圍；",
            "（四）應否把執行地法院更改贍養令的權力納入擬議《安排》的涵蓋範圍；",
            "（五）應否把其他命令納入擬議《安排》的涵蓋範圍；",
            "（六）申請相互執行判決當事人的司法管轄權依據；",
            "（七）擬議《安排》涵蓋的法院等級；以及",
            "（八）判決的終局性。",
            "諮詢文件現已上載於網頁：",
