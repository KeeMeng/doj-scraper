            "The Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said today (November 19) that following the establishment of the China Maritime Arbitration Commission (CMAC) Hong Kong Arbitration Center, coupled with Hong Kong's established international legal and arbitration institutions, Hong Kong would be even more equipped and qualified to meet the need for dispute resolution services by Mainland and overseas enterprises.",
            "Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the CMAC Hong Kong Arbitration Center today, Mr Yuen said that the CMAC was another major Mainland arbitration institution setting up its branch office in Hong Kong, after the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission established its arbitration centre in Hong Kong in 2012. It is also the CMAC's first arbitration centre outside the Mainland.",
            "\"The Government of the HKSAR is committed to creating a favourable environment for the development of dispute resolution services in order to enhance Hong Kong's status as an international legal and dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region. We have also been enhancing the legal system, strengthening our considerably internationalised legal regulatory framework, as well as the efficiency of the dispute resolution mechanism.",
            "\"We hope that the legal and arbitration sectors and institutions will step up publicity and encourage maritime and related enterprises to choose Hong Kong as a place for arbitration in their standard or other forms of contracts, and to use Hong Kong law as the governing law of their contractual disputes, so as to promote maritime law and arbitration services in Hong Kong and to enhance the standard of maritime arbitration services in the region. The goal of a win-win situation can then be achieved,\" Mr Yuen said.",
            "The CMAC, being a permanent arbitration institution specialising in the resolution of foreign and domestic maritime disputes, was set up in 1959 under the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). It focuses on resolving maritime, admiralty and logistics disputes as well as other contractual and non-contractual disputes through arbitration. Apart from its headquarters in Beijing, CMAC has so far established three sub-offices in Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin.",
            "Also attending today's inauguration ceremony were the Vice Chairman of the CCPIT, Mr Lu Pengqi, and the Vice Chairman of the CMAC, Mr Yu Jianlong.",
            "To promote the greater use of maritime arbitration services in Hong Kong, the Department of Justice, together with the CMAC, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, organised an international maritime arbitration seminar before the inauguration ceremony to allow the participants to gain a better understanding of the latest trends in international maritime arbitration.",
            "More than 200 professionals from the legal and arbitration sectors and the business sector from Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas participated in the seminar today.",
            "Delivering an opening speech at the seminar, Mr Yuen said that as an international maritime centre as well as a regional hub for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong could undoubtedly provide a wide range of legal and dispute resolution services to maritime service providers and users.",
            "He outlined Hong Kong's advantages in this area including an effective legal system, world-class legal and arbitration institutions, first-class legal and dispute resolution professionals, an extensive network of enforcing arbitral awards made in Hong Kong and user-friendly arbitration legislation.",
            "\"Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its geographical and institutional advantages and develop high value-added maritime services, including maritime legal and dispute resolution services, to better serve our users,\" Mr Yuen said.",

            "袁國強今日在海仲委香港仲裁中心的設立儀式上表示，今次是繼二○一二年中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會在香港設立仲裁中心後，另一個相當有份量的內地仲裁機構到香港設立辦事處，也是海仲委第一個在內地以外的仲裁中心。",
            "他說：「特區政府一直致力營造有利解決爭議服務發展的環境，以鞏固香港作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心的地位。我們也不斷完善法律制度，強化我們極具國際性的法律規管框架，以及提升爭議解決機制的效率。」",
            "「我們希望法律、仲裁業界和機構宜向航運及相關企業多加宣傳，鼓勵在其標準或其他形式的合同中，選擇香港作為仲裁地，以及選擇使用香港法律作為規管合同爭議的法律，從而推廣香港海事法律和仲裁服務，提升區內海事仲裁服務的水平，達致互利共贏的目標。」",
            "海仲委於一九五九年成立，是附設於中國國際貿易促進委員會（貿促會）的專門解決國內外海事爭議的常設仲裁機構，主要以仲裁的方式，解決海事、海商和物流爭議，以及其他契約性和非契約性爭議。海仲委的總部設於北京，現時只在上海、天津、重慶設有分會。",
            "出席今日的儀式還有貿促會副會長盧鵬起和海仲委副主任于健龍。",
            "為推動香港更廣泛使用海事仲裁服務，律政司於儀式前與海仲委、香港國際仲裁中心及香港貿易發展局合辦一個國際海事仲裁研討會，讓與會者加深對海事仲裁最新趨勢的認識。二百多名分別來自香港、內地和海外法律和仲裁服務界的專業人士及商界代表出席了今日的研討會。",
            "袁國強為研討會致開幕辭時表示，香港作為國際航運中心，以及亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心，毫無疑問能為海事服務供應商和使用者提供廣泛的法律及解決爭議服務。",
            "他列舉香港在這方面的優勢，包括完善的法律制度、世界級的法律及仲裁機構、一流的法律及解決爭議專業隊伍、龐大的執行仲裁裁決的網絡，和易於應用的仲裁法例。",
            "袁國強說：「香港將繼續利用其地域和架構上的優勢，發展高增值航運服務，包括海事法律及解決爭議服務，為使用者提供更好的服務。」",
