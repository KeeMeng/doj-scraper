            "Responding to the US Administration's so-called \"advisory\" to US businesses and individuals operating in Hong Kong, the Department of Justice (DoJ) today (July 17) issued the following statement:",
            "The National Security Law (NSL) is in line with the international practice of safeguarding national security. It is appalling to see that a number of western countries have launched groundless attacks on the NSL with a deliberate attempt to mislead the international community.",
            "The NSL clearly stipulates that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall protect the rights and freedoms enjoyed by residents under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong in accordance with the law. However, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. It must be borne in mind that the ICCPR expressly states that they may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law if it is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc.",
            "In handling cases of endangering national security, DoJ's prosecutors must act in accordance with the NSL and local law. All prosecutorial decisions are based on admissible evidence and applicable laws. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the political beliefs or background of the persons involved. Prosecutions would only be commenced if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction. The DoJ has been carrying out this constitutional duty in a professional and fair manner.",
            "Extraterritorial application vested with the NSL is in line with the well-recognised international law principle of \"protective jurisdiction\". If foreigners commit crimes abroad against a sovereign State that endanger its security or its vital interests, the sovereign State can adopt laws with extraterritorial effects to exercise prescriptive criminal jurisdiction. Extraterritoriality is in fact a common feature of national security laws in many countries. For instance, the United States Code, the Logan Act of the United States, the Terrorism (Suppression of bombings) Act of Singapore, the German Criminal Code, etc. Undoubtedly, the extraterritorial effect provided for in the NSL aligns with the principles of international law and international practice.",
            "In the HKSAR, the only criteria upon which judges are appointed is their judicial and professional quality, and their appointment by the Chief Executive is upon the recommendation of an independent statutory commission. When adjudicating cases under the NSL, judges remain independent and impartial in performing their judicial duties, free from any interference. The arrangement on the designation of judges under the NSL does not undermine the highly respected judicial independence of the HKSAR. The HKSAR has been entrusted with the responsibility under the NSL to exercise jurisdiction over most of the cases, save for only three specified situations.",
            "Sovereign equality is a basic norm of international relations and a fundamental principle of international law, with the Charter of the United Nations (UN) expressly setting out this principle. The principle of non-intervention is an important concept central to sovereign equality. Further, the International Court of Justice in its judgment in 1986 reiterated non-intervention as a principle of customary international law.",
            "Under the principles of State sovereignty and non-intervention, sanctions should be brought only in very limited circumstances, such as dealing with terrorism or nuclear proliferation, and in an appropriate forum, which is the UN Security Council. Other so-called \"sanctions\", known as unilateral coercive measures, are contrary to international law and the UN framework, and most importantly violate the principle of non-intervention under international law.",
            "Unilateral coercive measures are at odds with the international law principle of non-intervention, unbecoming of any civilised nation, and is a hindrance to international peace and stability. In the face of international illegal acts, countries are justified in deploying countermeasures as a response to a breach of the principle of non-intervention against itself. Therefore, the countermeasures adopted by the Central People's Government are legitimate and an accepted practice under international law.",
            "The enactment of the NSL is in line with the international practice of safeguarding national security and the sovereign rights of our country. Hong Kong's legal system and rule of law remain robust with law and order restored. Hong Kong's financial market continues to grow after 2019. This evidences the benefits and importance of the NSL to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.",

            "就美國政府向在香港經營的美國企業和個人發出所謂「商業警告」，律政司今日（七月十七日）發表以下聲明回應：",
            "《香港國安法》符合國際上維護國家安全的慣例，我們很驚訝有一些西方國家對《香港國安法》展開無理的攻擊，故意誤導國際社會。",
            "《香港國安法》明確指出香港特區應當依法保護居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》（《公約》）和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港有關規定享有的權利和自由。但有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公約》訂明可在有必要保障包括國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，依法律規定對部分權利和自由作出限制。",
            "律政司的檢控人員必定按照《香港國安法》和本地法律處理涉及危害國家安全的案件。所有檢控決定是基於可接納證據和適用法律，案件不會因涉案人士的政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同，律政司在有充分可被法院接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪的情況下，才會提出起訴。律政司一直以專業和公正的態度履行憲制職責。",
            "《香港國安法》的域外效力符合國際法的「保護管轄」原則。若身處境外的外國人對於一個主權國家進行危害其安全或核心利益的犯罪行為，該主權國家可透過具備域外效力的法律行使刑事管轄權。事實上，不少國家的國家安全法律也具備域外效力，例如美國法典、美國《盧根法》、新加坡《恐怖主義（制止炸彈襲擊）法》、德國《刑法典》等。毫無疑問，《香港國安法》的域外效力是符合國際法的原則以及國際慣例。",
            "在香港特區，法官是根據其司法和專業才能，經一個獨立的委員會推薦，由行政長官作出任命。法官在處理涉及《香港國安法》的案件時，仍然是獨立公正地履行司法職務，不受任何干預。《香港國安法》內指定法官的安排絕無損害香港特區一直備受尊崇的司法獨立。除了三類特定的例外情況，香港特區獲授權對絕大部分涉及《香港國安法》的案件行使管轄權。",
            "主權平等是國際關係的基本慣例，也是國際法的基本原則，《聯合國憲章》已清楚訂明有關原則，至於不干涉原則是主權平等的核心概念，再者，國際法院在一九八六年的判決裁定不干涉原則是國際習慣法的一部分。",
            "在國家主權及不干涉原則下，制裁只適用於極為有限的情況，例如針對與恐怖主義或核武擴散相關的問題，並應透過適當的平台——由聯合國安全理事會實施。其他所謂「制裁」屬於「單邊強制措施」，不但與國際法和聯合國的框架相違背，最重要的是違反了國際法規定的不干涉原則。",
            "單邊強制措施違反了國際法下的不干涉原則，不是文明國家的所為，有礙國際和平與穩定。面對國際違法行為，各國有理由採取任何反制或其他措施，以回應違反不干涉原則的行徑。因此，中央政府採取反制措施是合法的，亦為國際法所接受。",
            "制定《香港國安法》是合法行使國家主權及符合國際上維護國家安全的做法，香港的司法制度和法治維持堅穩，社會恢復秩序。香港的金融市場在二○一九年後穩步上揚，這足以證明《香港國安法》對香港穩定和繁榮的效益和重要性。",
