            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at a media session after attending a radio programme today (June 6):",
            "Reporter: You said the Department of Justice (DoJ) is still responsible for future prosecutions if the national security law is in place. Does that mean it will co-operate with the national security agency? Can you explain more on the aspect of retrospectivity? What is the exceptional case?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I will answer the last question first. At the moment, nobody has seen the draft of the legislation, so it is not possible to say what is going to happen there. Insofar as retrospectivity is concerned, as a matter of principle, criminal charges are not to be made retrospectively, and therefore there ought not be retrospective effect when the law is legislated. However, there is always some exception. The exception arises in relation to treaty and customary international law. But there are generally very small amount of situations.",
            "In respect of the role of the DoJ, under Article 63 of the Basic Law, the DoJ is responsible for all criminal prosecution matters without any interference. Therefore, we will make our decision in relation to prosecution, whether or not to prosecute and ultimately to take charge of the prosecution matter in court, in accordance with evidence, the law and the Prosecution Code. This is how we are going to do it. Relevant law enforcement agencies will pass us the file, and probably the Police will be the law enforcement agency. We will have the file and then we will look at it, just as in any other normal way.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（六月六日）出席電台節目後，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者：剛才你提到，內地的法律制度即成文法，與香港的普通法，是兩套法律系統，如何可以說服市民，這兩套法律系統沒有很大衝突，讓市民放心？這是第一個問題。第二個問題，早前涉藏三公斤冰毒「K仔」的那名女子，為何律政司會撤控？既然已撤控，現在是否可透露多一點撤控原因？",
            "律政司司長：先回答你第二條問題，我們不會就每件案件作評論。進行檢控時，當然要檢視相關證據、作客觀評核等，然後才作出決定。至於為何撤控，我不是談論該案，通常來說，有些情況是因為有新的證據，又或在首次作出檢控決定時是一個holding charge（臨時控罪），當檔案來到律政司時，我們發現可能證據不足，我們便要撤控。這是一般性的原則，我不會具體評論此案。",
            "中國的成文法與香港的普通法，當然在制度上有些不同，但我們現在談一些很基本、很重大的原則，例如國家安全，每一個不論是成文法國家還是普通法國家，對國家安全的要求其實也是一致的。第二，可能在刑法上，我們有很多擔心，會否不同呢？其實在中國的刑法上，無罪假設（presumption of innocence）、舉證責任（burden of proof），又或者定罪標準是無合理疑點等，其實是一致的，沒有大區別。所以大家無需過分擔心。如何令市民多些了解，我相信是我們不斷出來解說，市民亦不斷客觀地了解。",
