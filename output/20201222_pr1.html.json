            "The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH), Dr Christophe Bernasconi, for the technical and administrative arrangements relating to the secondment of legal professionals today (December 22) at a virtual signing ceremony.",
            "Addressing the ceremony, Ms Cheng said that it was the Department of Justice's policy initiative to nurture legal talents through continuous provision of training opportunities including secondment arrangements with international organisations. Thanking the HCCH's strong support for this scheme, Ms Cheng said she was pleased to note that lawyers in both the public and private sectors have opportunities to gain experience at the HCCH under the secondment arrangement, which would expand their knowledge of the operation of international organisations, broaden their horizons through learning from international law experts, and inject a Hong Kong perspective into shaping the development of international law.",
            "The virtual signing ceremony was held at the former French Mission Building, an important part of the Hong Kong Legal Hub where the HCCH's Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific in the HKSAR has recently been relocated. The technical support in hosting the ceremony was provided by the Technical Partner, eBRAM, by leveraging its online platform.",
