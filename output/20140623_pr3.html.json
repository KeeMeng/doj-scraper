            "Following is the speech by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, at the opening ceremony of Prosecution Week 2014 today (June 23):",
            "Secretary for Justice; President of the Law Society, Mr Ambrose Lam; Representative of the Bar Association, Mr Graham Harris SC; distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:",
            "Thank you all for joining the official opening of Prosecution Week 2014 organised by the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice. I extend to all of you my warmest welcome.",
            "Prosecution Week owes its genesis to Mr Zervos, my predecessor, now his lordship. For that, we thank him. For those of you who were involved in the first one held in July 2012, you may still be keeping the souvenirs specifically designed for that event. They were two rulers, one had on it printed the words \"RULE OF LAW\", and the other one \"RULE OUT CRIME\" – most fitting themes for the first Prosecution Week.",
            "This term \"rule of law\" – a term we have heard so much - is however not a mere slogan. It is, without doubt, one of Hong Kong's most important core values. It is the golden thread that runs through the fabric of the Prosecution Code which we adhere to. It is a value which we prosecutors are required to comply with and promote.",
            "How the prosecution complies with and promotes the rule of law, and what we do for that purpose, are the key thinking behind the theme of this year's Prosecution Week. We want to be more specific. In Chinese, our theme this year is \"秉持公正，彰顯法治\". As explained and supplemented to by our English theme, we emphasise that the prosecution service needs to be Fearless, Accountable, Impartial and Robust in conducting prosecutions. The acronym is \"FAIR Prosecutions\".",
            "One wonders why \"fearlessness\" is an essential factor. It is. Prosecutions are often controversial. The prosecutor must have the strength and confidence to resist criticism from whatever quarter, no matter how strident or painful. We welcome criticism. We improve as a result. But to make a prosecutorial decision in a particular way because of fear of criticism will be wrong.",
            "The need to be accountable and impartial is obvious. A prosecutor acts on behalf of the community. A prosecutor has no ego when discharging his or her duties. Personal preferences and idiosyncrasies of the prosecutor have no role to play. Political considerations are completely irrelevant. The judgment of the prosecutor on a case must never be overborne by such irrelevant considerations. Independence is the norm.",
            "It is also important to be robust. \"Rule out crime\" – I repeat one of the themes of the First Prosecution Week. It is indeed one of the duties of the prosecutor to ensure that the prosecution case is conducted robustly and firmly. I may put it in another way – prosecution is not for the faint-hearted.",
            "But above all, I emphasise, the prosecution should be fair. That is the most important concept, one which we would like to impress upon the public through its adoption as the theme of this Prosecution Week.",
            "We however appreciate this. We may aspire to be fair. We may actually be acting most fairly. But until the public understands how we operate, and until the public believes that we act fairly, we are at most only half way there. It is with this in mind that Prosecution Week was first introduced, and why we continue it. It aims to provide a platform for closer links with the public, and to help increase the accessibility, openness, transparency and accountability of the criminal justice system to the community as a whole.",
            "The activities of this Prosecution Week 2014 are aimed at bringing the Prosecutions Division and the general public closer together. In particular, we have organised a slogan competition and have received a good response from students of many local secondary schools. Some 108 entries have been submitted. The winners of the competition are with us for today's official opening and the award presentation ceremony will be held shortly.",
            "During Prosecution Week, we will also draw students into the prosecution work process and share our experiences in daily work. We do so through arranging activities such as visits, talks and mock courts. We have even arranged some barrister wigs for students to try on. We have received a keen response from a total of 30 secondary schools for enrolment in the activities, which is the largest number of responses in the three years since Prosecution Week was first launched.",
            "We however appreciate the limitation of this event. It lasts only one week. There are limits as to what we can do during this short span of time. To address that, we have recently launched the Meet the Community programme. It is a programme which runs through the year. The idea is to send our prosecutors out to interested schools and community organisations in the territory. They give talks to students and members of the public on important legal topics relevant to the criminal justice system. The topics we have prepared include the rule of law, the role of prosecutors, drug abuse, cyber bullying, juvenile crimes, sexual offences, white collar crimes, triad activities, etc. On a personal level, we hope that students and our audiences will find the topics useful. What they have heard may help them to identify and steer away from crime. On a general and more important level, we hope that the public will have a better understanding of the criminal justice system. The continuous maintenance of the rule of law hinges on this.",
            "We hope all participants will benefit from Prosecution Week. I know the prosecution can. Thank you.",
            "With these remarks, I invite Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, the Secretary for Justice, to deliver an opening address for Prosecution Week.",
            "Thank you again for attending today's opening ceremony. Special thanks must go to our Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, the Bar Association and the Law Society for their overwhelming backing for Prosecution Week. I am confident that with the support from all of you and the general public, Prosecution Week 2014 will be a great success. Thank you.",

            "以下是刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師今日（六月二十三日）出席檢控週2014揭幕儀式的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "袁司長、律師會會長林新強先生、大律師公會代表夏偉志資深大律師、各位嘉賓、各位先生、女士：",
            "首先多謝各位出席由律政司刑事檢控科舉辦的2014年檢控週開幕典禮，謹致以熱烈歡迎。",
            "檢控週由前任刑事檢控專員、現任高等法院法官薛偉成先生首先推行舉辦。為此，我們要向薛偉成先生致謝。各位如曾參與二○一二年七月首次舉辦的檢控週，或許還保留特別為該項活動設計的紀念品，就是兩把分別印有\"RULE OF LAW\"（法治）及\"RULE OUT CRIME\"（滅罪）的間尺──首次舉辦的檢控週以此為主題，最合適不過。",
            "對於「法治」這詞，我們都耳熟能詳，但這並非口號而已。毫無疑問，法治是香港最重要的核心價值之一，而我們遵行的《檢控守則》，通篇內容皆奉此為圭臬。我們作為檢控人員，既須秉行法治，也須推廣法治。",
            "檢控機關如何秉行法治和推廣法治，以及為此目的應付出甚麼努力，是今年檢控週主題背後的主要理念。我們想更具體說明，以「秉持公正，彰顯法治」作為今年檢控週的中文主題。正如英文主題所解釋和補充，我們強調檢控機關在進行檢控工作時，必須Fearless（無畏無懼）、Accountable（勇於承擔）、Impartial（不偏不倚），並且Robust (嚴厲執行），首四個字母拼起來，就是\"F.A.I.R. Prosecutions\"。",
            "大家也許會問，為何「無畏無懼」是必要的因素。確實如此。檢控工作常會引起爭議，檢控人員必須意志堅定，信心十足，才可應付各方的批評，無論這些批評是如何嚴厲或令人不安。我們歡迎批評，為的是可以作出改善。但是，基於懼怕批評而作出某項檢控決定，卻是錯誤的做法。",
            "檢控人員必須勇於承擔，不偏不倚，理由顯而易見。檢控人員代表社會行事，在履行職務時沒有自我，也不會表現個人偏好和風格，政治因素完全不在考慮之列。檢控人員對案件作出的判斷，永不可受這些毫不相干的考慮因素所支配。檢控的獨立性應視作常規。",
            "嚴厲執行的態度也同樣重要。「滅罪」──我再說，即首次舉辦的檢控週的主題之一。檢控人員其中一項職責，無疑是確保以全心全力和堅定不移的態度檢控案件。或許我可以另一方式說明，檢控工作不適合怯懦的人。",
            "但我強調，首要的是，檢控必須公平公正，這是最重要的概念，我們希望以此作為今年檢控週的主題，讓市民留下深刻印象。",
            "不過我們十分理解一點。我們可能渴求秉持公正，可能確實做到大公無私，但除非公眾明白我們如何運作，以及相信我們處事公正，否則我們極其量只是達到目標的一半。這正是我們推出並繼續舉辦檢控週的原因。這個活動的目的，是提供一個平台，讓我們與公眾更密切聯繫，協助加強刑事司法制度與社會的接觸，以及讓檢控制度更為公開透明和具承擔性。",
            "這次2014檢控週的活動，旨在拉近刑事檢控科和市民的距離。特別一提的是，我們舉辦了標語創作比賽，得到本港多間中學的學生踴躍參加，一共收到108份參賽作品。得獎同學也有出席今天的開幕典禮，我們會在稍後進行頒獎儀式。",
            "在檢控週內，我們也會透過安排其他參觀、講座及模擬法庭等活動，讓學生投入檢控程序當中和分享我們的日常工作經驗。我們更準備了大律師假髮，讓學生試戴。我們共收到三十間中學報名參加有關活動，反應十分熱切，是自檢控週舉辦三年以來最多的數目。",
            "不過，我們深明這項活動有其限制，就是為期只有一星期，而在這短促的時間內所能做的，實有限。為此，我們近日推出了「與公眾會面」計劃。這項計劃全年推行，構思是由我們的檢控人員主動到訪全港感興趣的學校及社區機構，為學生和巿民舉辦講座，講解與刑事司法制度有關的重要法律議題。我們準備好的議題包括秉行法治、檢控人員的角色、濫用藥物、網上欺凌、青少年罪行、性罪行、白領罪行、黑社會活動等。在個人層面，我們希望學生和聽眾會覺得這些議題有用，聆聽後能幫助他們識別罪行，遠離罪惡。在更廣泛而且更重要的層面，我們希望市民對刑事司法制度有更多了解。這是法治得以維繫的關鍵所在。",
            "希望所有參與者都能從檢控週獲益，據我所知，檢控團隊必定獲益良多。多謝各位。",
            "現在謹請律政司司長袁國強資深大律師為檢控週致開幕辭。",
            "再次多謝各位出席今天的開幕典禮，我特別感謝袁司長、大律師公會和律師會對檢控週的鼎力支持，我深信在你們和公眾的支持下，2014年檢控週的活動必定能夠取得美滿成績。多謝各位。",
