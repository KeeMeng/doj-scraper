            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, after attending the luncheon meeting of the Hong Kong Public Administration Association today (May 22):",
            "Reporter: You stressed just now that you would be treating every single case apolitically. What about the Ken Tsang case where seven police officers allegedly beat him up in the Tamar Park? How is the progress of that case right now?",
            "Secretary for Justice: If I remember correctly when I answered that question, I was saying that the court will be dealing with cases apolitically. In response to your questions, I can also guarantee you that our prosecutors, namely the colleagues of the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice, will also decide any cases of prosecution in an apolitical manner. In other words, we will not take into account any political considerations when we decide whether to prosecute or when we decide any prosecution shall or shall not be continued. In response to the question that you just raised, because you were mentioning a specific case and the case is now still under progress, therefore I am not at liberty to divulge to you the details of how that case is being handled. I can tell you two points, though. Point one is my colleagues are looking at the case very carefully and in strict accordance with the law. Point number two, if I may also add, we fully appreciate the sensitivity of the case. And indeed, to ensure that the ultimate advice and recommendation that we are going to make is independent and will be well received by the community, we have in fact decided to engage outside independent senior counsel to advise on the case. As we have done on some other occasions, the engagement of outside independent senior counsel to provide legal advice independently is a very effective way to ensure that ultimately the decision to be made is, first of all, independent, and will be perceived to be independent. So that is one way to alleviate any concern and I hope I have answered your question.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（五月二十二日）出席香港公共行政學會午餐會後，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者︰司長，想問「一地兩檢」的問題，可否談談香港和中央政府有沒有研究會不會在《基本法》附件引入國內法律，如果這樣做，你覺得會不會和你剛才提到，希望將來都能維持法治這個理想會有少許違背的地方？",
            "律政司司長：正如我數日前說，我們以在通車時可以落實「一地兩檢」為工作目標，在我們落實這工作目標時，大家也很清楚，無論我們也好，中央官員也好，大家也有很清晰的目標，就是在《基本法》和符合香港法律框架下做這事，任何方案如有危險違反《基本法》，我們也不會考慮。亦是這原因，那天在深圳接受傳媒訪問時，我們說除了要定大方向外，亦要反覆考慮細節，在運作上會否出現一些法律問題。亦要在考慮大方向後，用細節反覆驗證。原因正是我們不希望有任何情況，無論是在我們設計制度時或在運作上，會出現一些違反《基本法》的情況。所以剛才你的擔心，希望你不需要再繼續有這個擔心，因為我們一定不會希望往後的制度會出現違反《基本法》，這不是香港特區政府想見到，也不是中央官員想見到的。",
            "記者：現時曾健超案件的進展去到哪裏？因警方多次說已交律政司考慮。",
            "律政司司長：警方是交了他們有的資料給我們，我們的同事亦正在看他們的資料，研究相關的證據和法律問題。好像剛才我用英語回答另一位朋友的問題時，就是為了釋除公眾的疑慮，我們已決定聘用外間獨立資深大律師提供法律意見，因為我們明白這一案件社會上非常關注，亦是敏感個案，所以為了釋除公眾疑慮，亦為了往後的結論或我們所作的建議，無論是哪個方向也好，我們是得到獨立資深大律師公正、公平的建議後，我們才會作出。",
