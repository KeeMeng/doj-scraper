            "Following is a question by the Hon Ho Kai-ming and a written reply by the Solicitor General, Mr Wesley Wong, SC (in the absence of the Secretary for Justice), in the Legislative Council today (July 11):",
            "Question:",
            "In June last year, a well-known person was suspected of having intimidated a reporter while the latter was reporting news. The Department of Justice (DoJ) has so far not decided whether or not to institute prosecution against that person. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether, in handling criminal cases that involve well-known persons, the DoJ needs longer time to examine the particulars of the cases in order to make prosecution decisions; if so, of the reasons for that; if not, why the DoJ has so far not yet made any prosecution decision in respect of the aforesaid case;",
            "(2) of the DoJ's considerations in making a prosecution decision in respect of the case, and whether such considerations include the possible impacts of instituting prosecution on the community and public interests;",
            "(3) whether the DoJ has assessed if the fact that it has so far not made any prosecution decision in respect of the case has any social repercussion, such as undermining the morale of the journalists; if it has assessed and the outcome is in the affirmative, whether the DoJ will expedite its handling of the case;",
            "(4) as the Victims of Crime Charter stipulates that \"[s]o far as can be done without prejudicing the progress or outcome, victims of crime shall be kept fully informed of the progress of the case\", of the number of enquiries received by the DoJ in each of the past two years from reporters as victims about the progress of the cases concerned, the number of occasions on which the DoJ failed to make a reply within the pledged time (i.e. 14 working days) and the reasons for that, as well as the improvement measures to be put in place; and",
            "(5) whether the DoJ will compile statistics on a regular basis in respect of cases involving the threatening of freedom of news coverage, and make prosecution decisions expeditiously so as to demonstrate its determination to safeguard freedom of news coverage?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Prosecutors within the Department of Justice (DoJ) always uphold the constitutional duty under Article 63 of the Basic Law in handling all prosecution work in a fair, impartial and open manner. Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that \"the DoJ of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference\".",
            "The independence of the prosecutor is elaborated in the Prosecution Code of the DoJ. According to paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of the Code, in making decisions and exercising discretion, a prosecutor must act fairly and dispassionately on the basis of the law, the facts provable by the admissible evidence, other relevant information known to the prosecution and any applicable policy or guidelines. Specifically, a prosecutor must not be influenced by:",
            "(a) any investigatory, political, media, community or individual interest or representation;",
            "(b) the personal feelings or beliefs of the prosecutor concerning the offence, the suspect, the accused or a victim of crime;",
            "(c) the possible effect of the decision on the personal or professional circumstances of those who have the conduct of the case;",
            "(d) the possible political effect on the government, any political party, any group or individual;",
            "(e) possible media or public reaction to the decision;",
            "(f) the race, religion, sex, ethnic or national origin, colour, language, political or other opinion, social origin, social or political affiliation, official or other position in the community, lawful activities, beliefs, property, health, disability or any other personal characteristics of the suspect or accused or any other person involved or concerned (although such considerations may need to be addressed for other reasons).",
            "A prosecutor must act in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Prosecution Code in making a decision to prosecute or not to prosecute. The fundamental principle is that unless there is sufficient admissible evidence so that the case has a reasonable prospect of conviction, and that it is in the public interest to prosecute, no prosecution should be commenced.",
            "In respect of parts (1) to (5) of the Hon Ho Kai-ming’s question, the DoJ’s response is as follows:",
            "(1) and (3) The time required to process a case from commencement of investigation to institution of prosecution depends on a number of factors, including the nature and complexity of the case, the quantity of evidence to be handled, duration for seeking legal advice and whether further follow-up is necessary pursuant to the legal advice, etc. Since the evidence and the law involved in and the level of complexity of each case differ, the processing time each requires may also vary.",
            "Take the prosecution work relating to the \"Occupy Movement\" as an example. Since the number of arrested persons is large and the volume of evidence involved is substantial, colleagues of the Prosecutions Division have to spend substantial time to study and examine the relevant materials and possible legal or technical issues. For instance, colleagues concerned have to take a long time to go through the video evidence, consider admissibility and other questions relevant under the law of evidence, analyse the specific circumstances of each and every incident, and provide legal advice on the appropriate manner to handle each relevant person. Moreover, unless the relevant incidents could be handled on their own, the numerous incidents involved in the \"Occupy Movement\" are often inter-connected, rendering it impossible to handle individual arrestees separately. Quite the contrary, it is necessary for the DoJ to consider the cases of numerous arrestees in a comprehensive and holistic manner. In respect of the 48 persons who were arrested after the \"Occupy Movement\" (including some of those suspected to have performed a leading role), after seeking the advice of the DoJ, the Police on March 27, 2017 charged nine of them with the offences of conspiracy to commit public nuisance, incitement to commit public nuisance, and incitement to incite public nuisance. The pre-trial review of the case has been fixed for September 17, 2018 and the trial for November 19, 2018. Therefore, contrary to what was suggested in the question, the prosecution work is not such that no prosecutorial decision had been made in respect of any of the organisers concerned.",
            "I wish to reiterate that the DoJ will strive to ensure that all prosecutorial decisions are made in a timely manner, but the progress of individual cases (including those involving celebrities and/or with journalists being the targets of alleged offences) may be affected by the factors mentioned above. Hence, save for cases involving vulnerable witnesses, we are in general unable (nor is it desirable for us) to expedite the handling of cases on account of the identity of the persons involved.",
            "(2) As stated above, a prosecutor will consider only the applicable law, the relevant evidence, the Prosecution Code and any applicable policy or guidelines in deciding whether or not to prosecute a case. According to the Code, prosecution should be instituted only if there is sufficient admissible evidence and where it is in the public interest to do so. Any political or media interest or representation, the possible political effect of the decision to prosecute or otherwise on any group or individual, and the position of the person involved in the community are by no means relevant considerations.",
            "(4) It is the performance pledge of the DoJ’s Prosecutions Division to reply to enquiries on matters related to prosecution policy or decision within 14 working days of receipt of such enquiries, and to issue an interim reply if a substantive reply is not available within this period. On the other hand, in order not to prejudice the criminal proceedings that may arise, it is not appropriate for the DoJ to comment on the specific progress and handling approach of a case when law enforcement agencies are seeking legal advice from the DoJ on the same.",
            "The DoJ does not maintain information on the number of enquiries about the progress of cases involving journalists as victims or the number of delayed replies to such enquiries. Nevertheless, the DoJ will continue its endeavour to handle enquiries on matters related to prosecution policy or decision in compliance with the abovementioned performance pledge and in accordance with the principle not to prejudice criminal proceedings.",
            "(5) Freedom of the press is protected under Article 27 of the Basic Law and other Hong Kong laws. The Special Administrative Region Government, including law enforcement agencies and the DoJ, respects and strives to safeguard freedom of the press. The DoJ takes a serious view of alleged illegal acts targeting at journalists, and will ensure that prosecutorial decisions are made timely.",

            "以下是今日（七月十一日）在立法會會議上何啟明議員的提問和法律政策專員黃惠沖資深大律師（在律政司司長缺席期間）的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "去年六月，有一位知名人士涉嫌恐嚇一名採訪中的記者，而律政司至今仍未決定是否對該人提出檢控。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）律政司在處理涉及知名人士的刑事案件時，是否需較長時間研究案情以作出檢控決定；如是，原因為何；如否，為何律政司至今未就上述案件作出檢控決定；",
            "（二）律政司就該案件作出檢控決定時的考慮因素，以及當中是否包括提出檢控可能會對社會造成的影響及公眾利益；",
            "（三）律政司有否評估至今未就該案件作出檢控決定，有否對社會產生不良影響，例如打擊新聞從業員的士氣；如有評估而結果為有，律政司會否加快處理該案件；",
            "（四）鑑於《罪行受害者約章》訂明「在不妨害案件進度或結果的情況下，罪行受害者有權知悉案件的進展情況」，過去兩年每年律政司接獲記者作為案件的受害人查詢案件進度的宗數、律政司未有在服務承諾時間（即十四個工作天）內作出回覆的宗數和原因，以及有何改善措施；及",
            "（五）律政司會否定期統計涉及威脅新聞採訪自由的案件，並盡快作出檢控決定，以彰顯其維護新聞採訪自由的決心？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "律政司的檢控人員一直恪守《基本法》第六十三條下的憲制責任，以公平、公正和公開的方式處理所有檢控工作。《基本法》第六十三條訂明：「香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」。",
            "就檢控人員的獨立性，律政司的《檢控守則》有詳細闡述。根據《檢控守則》第1.1及1.2段，檢控人員在作出決定和行使酌情權時，檢控人員必須根據法律、可接納的證據所證明的事實、控方已知的其他相關資料，以及任何適用的政策或指引，公正理智地行事。具體而言，檢控人員不得受下列因素影響︰",
            "（a）任何涉及調查、政治、傳媒、社群或個人的利益或陳述；",
            "（b）檢控人員對罪行、疑犯、被告或罪行受害者的個人感受或看法；",
            "（c）作出的決定對處理案件的人在個人或專業方面可能造成的影響；",
            "（d）對政府、任何政黨、任何團體或個人在政治上可能帶來的影響；",
            "（e）傳媒或公眾對有關決定的可能反應；",
            "（f）疑犯、被告或任何其他涉案或相關人士的種族、宗教、性別、人種或國籍、膚色、語言、政見或其他主張、社會階級、社會或政治連繫、公職地位或其他社會地位、合法活動、信念、財產、健康狀況、殘疾，或任何其他個人特性（即使或需基於其他原因而顧及這些考慮因素）。",
            "在決定應否提出檢控時，檢控人員必須依據《檢控守則》的指引行事。基本原則是，除非有充分可被法院接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪，並且符合公眾利益，否則不應展開檢控。",
            "上述有關檢控工作的獨立性，及決定是否提出檢控的原則，適用於每一宗案件。律政司不會因為案件是否涉及公眾人物或傳媒而在處理上有所不同。",
            "就何啟明議員第（一）至（五）項提問，律政司回答如下：",
            "（一）及（三）案件由展開調查至提出檢控的所需處理時間，視乎多項因素而定，包括案件的性質及複雜程度、需要處理的證據數量、諮詢法律意見的時間，以及是否需要就法律意見作出進一步跟進等。由於每宗案件涉及的證據和法律也不一樣，複雜程度也不盡相同，因此所需時間也不一樣。",
            "舉例來說，就與「佔領運動」相關的檢控工作而言，由於被拘捕人士數目眾多，涉及的證據繁多，刑事檢控科的同事須花大量時間去研究和審視相關資料及有可能出現的法律或技術問題，例如負責同事需要用相當長時間審視錄像證據、考慮其「可接納性」等證據法上的問題、分析每件事件的個別情況，以及就每名相關人士的適當處理方法提供法律指引。此外，除非相關事件可先行獨立處理，「佔領行動」涉及的眾多事件往往環環相扣，不可將個別被捕人士作「斬件式」獨立處理。反之，律政司有必要就眾多名被捕人士作整體通盤考慮。就「佔領運動」後拘捕的四十八人（包括部分懷疑在事件中扮演主導角色的人士），警方在徵詢律政司意見後，已於二○一七年三月二十七日以串謀公眾妨擾、煽惑他人公眾妨擾及煽惑他人煽惑公眾妨擾罪名落案控告其中的九名人士。該案已定於二○一八年九月十七日進行審前覆核，及於二○一八年十一月十九日進行審訊。因此，有關的檢控工作並非如問題中所指，仍未就任何有關的發起人作出檢控決定。",
            "我希望重申，律政司會致力確保所有的檢控決定會適時作出，但個別案件（包括涉及知名人士及／或針對新聞從業員的涉嫌違法個案）的處理進度受上所述的因素影響。因此，一般而言我們未能（亦不宜）因為涉案人士的身分而加快處理時間（涉及易受傷害證人的案件除外）。",
            "（二）正如上文所述，檢控人員只會根據適用法律、相關證據、《檢控守則》以及任何適用的政策或指引考慮每一宗案件，決定應否提出檢控。根據《檢控守則》，每一宗案件都只能在確立有充分可被法院接納的證據、並在符合公眾利益的情況下，方可提出檢控。而任何涉及政治或傳媒的利益或陳述、檢控與否對任何團體或個人在政治上可能帶來的影響、以及涉案人士的社會地位，都絕對不是相關的考慮因素。",
            "（四）律政司刑事檢控科的服務承諾，是在接獲關於檢控政策或決定的查詢時，於十四個工作天內作覆，而如果未能在這限期內詳盡作覆，也會給予初步回覆。另一方面，當執法機關正就案件向律政司索取法律指引，律政司不宜評論案件的具體進度及處理方向，以免對可能衍生的刑事法律程序有所影響。",
            "律政司並無就記者作為受害人查詢案件進度的數目或就有關查詢延遲回覆的數目，備存資料。但律政司會繼續努力按上述的服務承諾，並以不影響刑事法律程序為原則，處理關於檢控政策或決定的查詢。",
            "（五）新聞自由受《基本法》第二十七條及其他香港法例保障，特區政府包括執法機關和律政司也尊重和致力維護新聞自由。律政司重視針對新聞從業員的涉嫌違法行為，並會確保檢控決定適時作出。",

            "（f）疑犯、被告或任何其他涉案或相關人士的種族、宗教、性別、人種或國籍、膚色、語言、政見或其他主張、社會階級、社會或政治連繫、公職地位或其他社會地位、合法活動、信念、財產、健康狀況、殘疾，或任何其他個人特性（即使或需基於其他原因而顧及這些考慮因素）",
            "在決定應否提出檢控時，檢控人員必須依據《檢控守則》的指引行事",
            "基本原則是，除非有充分可被法院接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪，並且符合公眾利益，否則不應展開檢控",
            "上述有關檢控工作的獨立性，及決定是否提出檢控的原則，適用於每一宗案件",
            "律政司不會因為案件是否涉及公眾人物或傳媒而在處理上有所不同",
            "就何啟明議員第（一）至（五）項提問，律政司回答如下：",
            "（一）及（三）案件由展開調查至提出檢控的所需處理時間，視乎多項因素而定，包括案件的性質及複雜程度、需要處理的證據數量、諮詢法律意見的時間，以及是否需要就法律意見作出進一步跟進等",
            "由於每宗案件涉及的證據和法律也不一樣，複雜程度也不盡相同，因此所需時間也不一樣",
            "舉例來說，就與「佔領運動」相關的檢控工作而言，由於被拘捕人士數目眾多，涉及的證據繁多，刑事檢控科的同事須花大量時間去研究和審視相關資料及有可能出現的法律或技術問題，例如負責同事需要用相當長時間審視錄像證據、考慮其「可接納性」等證據法上的問題、分析每件事件的個別情況，以及就每名相關人士的適當處理方法提供法律指引",
            "此外，除非相關事件可先行獨立處理，「佔領行動」涉及的眾多事件往往環環相扣，不可將個別被捕人士作「斬件式」獨立處理",
            "反之，律政司有必要就眾多名被捕人士作整體通盤考慮",
            "就「佔領運動」後拘捕的四十八人（包括部分懷疑在事件中扮演主導角色的人士），警方在徵詢律政司意見後，已於二○一七年三月二十七日以串謀公眾妨擾、煽惑他人公眾妨擾及煽惑他人煽惑公眾妨擾罪名落案控告其中的九名人士",
            "該案已定於二○一八年九月十七日進行審前覆核，及於二○一八年十一月十九日進行審訊",
            "因此，有關的檢控工作並非如問題中所指，仍未就任何有關的發起人作出檢控決定",
            "我希望重申，律政司會致力確保所有的檢控決定會適時作出，但個別案件（包括涉及知名人士及／或針對新聞從業員的涉嫌違法個案）的處理進度受上所述的因素影響",
            "因此，一般而言我們未能（亦不宜）因為涉案人士的身分而加快處理時間（涉及易受傷害證人的案件除外）",
            "（二）正如上文所述，檢控人員只會根據適用法律、相關證據、《檢控守則》以及任何適用的政策或指引考慮每一宗案件，決定應否提出檢控",
            "根據《檢控守則》，每一宗案件都只能在確立有充分可被法院接納的證據、並在符合公眾利益的情況下，方可提出檢控",
            "而任何涉及政治或傳媒的利益或陳述、檢控與否對任何團體或個人在政治上可能帶來的影響、以及涉案人士的社會地位，都絕對不是相關的考慮因素",
            "（四）律政司刑事檢控科的服務承諾，是在接獲關於檢控政策或決定的查詢時，於十四個工作天內作覆，而如果未能在這限期內詳盡作覆，也會給予初步回覆",
            "另一方面，當執法機關正就案件向律政司索取法律指引，律政司不宜評論案件的具體進度及處理方向，以免對可能衍生的刑事法律程序有所影響",
            "律政司並無就記者作為受害人查詢案件進度的數目或就有關查詢延遲回覆的數目，備存資料",
            "但律政司會繼續努力按上述的服務承諾，並以不影響刑事法律程序為原則，處理關於檢控政策或決定的查詢",
            "（五）新聞自由受《基本法》第二十七條及其他香港法例保障，特區政府包括執法機關和律政司也尊重和致力維護新聞自由",
            "律政司重視針對新聞從業員的涉嫌違法行為，並會確保檢控決定適時作出",
