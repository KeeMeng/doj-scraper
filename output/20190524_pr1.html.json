            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at a media session after attending the \"Mediate First\" Pledge Event at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre today (May 24):",
            "Reporter: Can you clarify reports that there are three other arbitration cases that you did not resign as arbitrator after you took over to head the Department of Justice? Were these three cases included in the six cases that were approved by the Chief Executive?",
            "Secretary for Justice: First of all, there are two questions that are mentioned. The first is whether I resigned in three cases. The three cases I assume that you are talking about are the three cases of the World Bank ICSID (International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes) cases. They are in the public domain. So if you can go on the web, you will see that in all those three cases I have well resigned as arbitrator. And I am no longer arbitrator in those cases. Those cases are still ongoing because the fact that I resigned and the new arbitrator is appointed to replace my role would, of course, allow the parties to continue to have their dispute resolved under the relevant rules. So those three cases continue but I am not the arbitrator. And if there is any reporting that I have not resigned from those three cases, they are wrong.",
            "Reporter: When did you resign? Did you resign after you took over as the Secretary for Justice? Or did you resign before that? Were these three cases included in the six cases that were approved by the Chief Executive? Thank you.",
            "Secretary for Justice: The resignation process has to be looked at in this way. First of all, bearing in mind the six cases that I have had to handle, for the reasons that we have already mentioned when I took the appointment as the Secretary for Justice. The cases of which there is no further involvement or that I can resign without causing too much troubles to the parties, I have completely resigned. So, in all the cases I resigned. There are six cases as we have reported, as you have noted, and as informed to the Chief Executive where I continue to serve as an arbitrator in order to finish what I am doing, or what I was doing at that point in time with my co-arbitrators. So in those six cases I continued to remain as arbitrator in finishing, for example, the interim award, or final award that I have had to handle, or the rendering the interim order, interim measures, or interlocutory orders that I have had to handle at that point in time. Once those relevant orders and awards have been rendered, assigned and distributed, I immediately resigned. Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（五月二十四日）出席二○一九年「調解為先」承諾書活動開幕儀式後，與傳媒談話的內容：",
            "律政司司長：多謝各位記者到來，今日的活動主題是「調解為先潛能盡展」，調解其實是一個很好處理問題的方法，所以我們希望市民、商業機構、甚或政府的問題，均可先嘗試以調解作為一個方法。在「潛能盡展」方面，它帶出兩點。第一是體育調解，在體育爭議上，調解可以發揮很多作用，譬如兩個足球會的球員轉會時，有時可能會有爭議，我們希望可以考慮用調解，又或贊助商和體育機構也可以用調解處理爭議。第二是deal mediation（交易調解），即是在促成一宗交易時，希望可以用調解，因為這樣可以利用調解的功能或技巧，把雙方的討論或交易完成。我們今日把從國際到本地做調解的工作都帶出來，希望大家為我們報道一下，從而把調解的方法，向市民甚至國際推廣。",
            "記者：司長，有報道指，你有三宗仲裁案件到現在仍未完成審理，你有否申報這三宗案件？",
            "律政司司長：首先，請給我少許時間解釋整個仲裁過程大概是怎樣。就該三宗仲裁案件，我已離開，並非仲裁員了。當然，仲裁案件不會因為我辭職，不再擔任仲裁員便完結。他們會繼續在更換仲裁員之後，讓仲裁法庭繼續審理案件，所以案件的進度與我有否再參與，其實不是掛鉤的，並無關係。另外，我亦要多說一點，譬如你們很關注這三宗案件是否我還有處理，現時來說，我已經完全沒有再處理任何仲裁案件。",
            "記者：你是否知道自己仍在處理這些仲裁案？此外，你在行政會議申報的六宗案件，是否包括這三宗？",
            "律政司司長：我已經無再處理任何仲裁案件，你剛才提及的六宗，我在上任時，向行政長官按照相關規則申報的，我亦已做完了。",
