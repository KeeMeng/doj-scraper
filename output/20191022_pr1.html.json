            "In response to some views that Hong Kong has jurisdiction over the Taiwan homicide case, the Department of Justice (DoJ) today (October 22) issued the following statement:",
            "Hong Kong has a common law system. Anyone who has a clear understanding of our law would understand that Hong Kong adopts the territoriality principle in respect of criminal jurisdiction. In general, such jurisdiction applies only when the whole or part of the criminal act takes place within Hong Kong's boundary. In response to views that Hong Kong should have jurisdiction over the homicide case given that the victim and the suspect are both Hong Kong citizens and that the crime was planned in Hong Kong, the DoJ must reiterate that it has already carefully and comprehensively considered the Police's investigation and the available evidence. There has only been sufficient evidence in Hong Kong to institute criminal prosecution in Hong Kong courts against the suspect for money laundering but not for other offences.",
            "In making prosecutorial decisions, the DoJ has always taken into account the available evidence and applicable laws, and acted independently in accordance with the Prosecution Code. A prosecution would only be commenced if there is sufficient admissible evidence to demonstrate a reasonable prospect of conviction. The DoJ would never institute prosecutions without sufficient evidential and legal bases. Furthermore, if the suspect is acquitted in Hong Kong, under the legal principle of double jeopardy, it may not be possible for subsequent prosecution of the same criminal act in another jurisdiction, with the result that the suspect may not be held legally responsible for his criminal act. Making arbitrary demands to the prosecutorial authority to commence prosecutions without sufficient evidential and legal bases is neither responsible nor does it accord with the principle of fair administration of justice.",
            "Anyone who committed an offence and completed serving his sentence would be released from prison. There is no legal basis for the Government to detain any discharged prisoner arbitrarily. The rule of law is a fundamental core value of Hong Kong such that government departments must carry out their duties according to the law and must not exercise their authority arbitrarily.",
            "It is the responsibility of every civilised society to bring those who break the law to justice. Justice could be served by the suspect surrendering himself voluntarily in response to an arrest warrant and facing the legal consequence willingly. Refusing to let the suspect surrender is not only in defiance of justice but also an irresponsible act contrary to the rule of law.",

            "針對有看法指香港有權處理台灣殺人案，律政司今日（十月二十二日）發出以下聲明：",
            "香港一直沿用普通法，對香港法律有清晰了解的人必然會明白在刑事司法管轄權方面，香港是奉行「屬地原則」，一般只會在全部或部分犯罪行為發生在香港境內，才會有司法管轄權。就有意見指出「本案加害者被害者均為香港居民，且預謀犯罪地在香港，港方應有司法管轄權」，律政司必須再次重申，已經對案件謹慎和全面地考慮警方的調查及所得的證據，在香港只有足夠證據控告疑犯清洗黑錢的罪名，並沒有足夠證據就其他罪行向他在香港法院提出刑事檢控。",
            "律政司的刑事檢控決定，均是嚴謹地按證據、適用法律和《檢控守則》獨立地作出，並只會在有充分可被法庭接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪的情況下，才會提出起訴。律政司絕對不會在沒有充分證據和法律基礎的情況下提出起訴。再者，若疑犯在香港被判無罪，基於「一罪不能兩審」的法律原則，他在另一個司法管轄區未必能夠就同一犯罪行為再被起訴，最終可能不需要負上相關的法律責任。任意要求檢控機關在沒有充分證據和法律基礎的情況下提出起訴，既不負責任，也不符合秉行公義的原則。",
            "任何人在香港因干犯罪行服刑完畢後均會獲釋，政府並沒有法律依據可以將釋囚任意繼續拘留。香港是一個法治社會，政府部門都必須依法執行職務，不能隨意行使職權。",
            "把違法的人繩之於法，是每一個文明社會應有之義。犯案者因應通緝令而自首，並願意承擔法律後果，能夠使公義得以彰顯。斷然拒絕犯案者自首，是罔顧公義及極不負責任的做法，亦有違法治的精神。",
