            "Following is the translation of a speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, to move the resumption of the second reading of the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2015 at the Legislative Council today (July 9):",
            "Acting President,",
            "First of all, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Bills Committee of the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2015, the Hon Kenneth Leung, and other members of the Bills Committee for their hard work in completing the scrutiny of the Bill. I am also grateful to the relevant bodies, including the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Law Society of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors and the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, for their valuable opinions.",
            "As I pointed out when introducing the Bill into this Council in February this year, the main objective of the Bill is to amend the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) so as to remove possible legal uncertainties that might arise from the opt-in mechanism provided for domestic arbitration in Part 11 of the Ordinance. We therefore propose amendments to the Bill to make it clear that parties opting for domestic arbitration should be free to decide on the number of arbitrators, whilst retaining the right to seek the assistance of the Court of First Instance of the HKSAR on the matters set out in sections 2 to 7 of Schedule 2 to the Ordinance.",
            "Furthermore, the Bill adds four new state parties (Note 1) to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (which is also known as the New York Convention) to the Schedule to the Arbitration (Parties to New York Convention) Order (Cap 609 sub leg A). In addition, the Bill also reflects a change in the official name of an existing state party (Note 2) and the extension of the application of the New York Convention by another existing state party (Note 3) to one of its territories.",
            "As a result of a recent change to the list of parties to the New York Convention, I will be moving a Committee Stage Amendment (CSA) shortly. The Bills Committee has noted the proposed CSA and expressed no objection to it.",
            "Conclusion",
            "The Department of Justice has been making every effort to enhance the status of Hong Kong as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region. Since the commencement of the existing Arbitration Ordinance in 2011, we have been in close contact with the arbitration sector and other stakeholders to ensure that the Arbitration Ordinance can be promptly updated. The Bill, when enacted, will help improve the opt-in mechanism for domestic arbitration, thereby further improving the arbitration regime of Hong Kong.",
            "With these remarks, Acting President, I urge Members to support the Second Reading of the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2015 and the amendment that I am going to propose at the Committee Stage. Thank you, Acting President.",
            "Note 1: The four new parties are: Bhutan, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guyana.",
            "Note 2: The name \"Bolivia\" has been changed to \"Bolivia (the Plurinational State of)\".",
            "Note 3: The United Kingdom has submitted a notification to extend the territorial application of the New York Convention to the British Virgin Islands.",

            "代主席：",
            "首先，我要感謝《2015年仲裁（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）法案委員會主席梁繼昌議員及其他委員的努力，令相關審議工作順利完成。我亦要感謝各有關團體，包括香港大律師公會、香港律師會、香港測量師學會，及香港國際仲裁中心提供的寶貴意見。",
            "正如我今年二月在向本會提交《條例草案》時指出，《條例草案》的主要目的，是修訂《仲裁條例》（第609章），以消除該條例因第十一部為本地仲裁而設的可供選用機制可能引起的不明確法律問題。因此，我們建議修訂《仲裁條例》，以清楚訂明選擇本地仲裁的當事人可自由決定仲裁員人數，但同時保留相關當事人就《仲裁條例》附表二第二至七條載述的事宜向特區原訟法庭尋求協助的權利。",
            "《條例草案》亦會在《仲裁（紐約公約締約方）令》（第609章附屬法例Ａ）附表中加入一九五八年《承認及執行外國仲裁裁決公約》（簡稱《紐約公約》）四個新締約方（註一）。此外，《條例草案》提出的建議修訂亦會反映《紐約公約》一個現有締約方的官方名稱有所更新（註二），以及另一現有締約方將該公約的適用範圍擴展到該締約方的一個領土（註三）。",
            "因應《紐約公約》締約方名單的新近變動，我稍後會在全體委員會審議階段動議一項修正案。法案委員會知悉該修正案的內容，亦沒有提出反對意見。",
            "結語",
            "律政司一直致力提升香港作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心的地位。自現行的《仲裁條例》於二○一一年實施以後，我們一直與仲裁界及其他持份者保持緊密溝通，適時對《仲裁條例》作出修改。《條例草案》獲得通過後，將會有效改善為本地仲裁而設的可供選用機制，從而進一步完善香港的仲裁制度。",
            "代主席，我謹此陳辭，懇請各位議員支持通過二讀《條例草案》，以及我稍後動議的一項修正案。多謝主席。",
