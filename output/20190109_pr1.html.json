            "The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, and the Minister of Justice of Japan, Mr Takashi Yamashita, signed the MoC at a ceremony in the HKSAR.",
            "The MoC provides a framework for Hong Kong and Japan to strengthen their communication, collaboration and co-operation on issues relating to international arbitration and mediation and to facilitate the development of services for international arbitration and mediation in Hong Kong and Japan.",
            "The International Affairs Division of the Minister's Secretariat of the Ministry of Justice will be the focal point for Japan while the newly established Inclusive Dispute Avoidance and Resolution (IDAR) Office of the DoJ will be the focal point for Hong Kong, to be responsible for implementation of the MoC. The IDAR Office spearheads the co-ordination of initiatives to promote Hong Kong as an ideal hub for deal making and a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services. It aims to facilitate access to justice and promote inclusive growth and sustainable development.",
            "The MoC reflects the joint efforts of Hong Kong and Japan in strengthening their co-operation and exchange of information regarding training in international arbitration and mediation, and provides a framework for the DoJ and the Ministry of Justice of Japan to promote collaborative initiatives and exchanges. It is expected that Hong Kong and Japan will benefit greatly from their co-operation in the development and provision of arbitration and mediation services.",
