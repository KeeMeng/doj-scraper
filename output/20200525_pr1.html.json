            "Different views have been expressed in recent days by legal sector on the draft Decision on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to safeguard national security (draft Decision), a spokesman for the Department of Justice today (May 25) issued the following statement to address the concerns:",
            "The National People's Congress (NPC) is the highest organ of state power in the People's Republic of China. Under the Constitution, the NPC has the power to introduce laws and other legal instruments including making Decisions. The Decision is to be made pursuant to Article 31, 62(2), (14) and (16) of the Constitution and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. Under Article 6 of the draft Decision, the NPC delegated the Standing Committee of the NPC (NPCSC) the duty to make the national security law applicable to the HKSAR.",
            "National security is outside the limits of the autonomy of the HKSAR but a matter under the purview of the Central Authorities. In view of the current situation in Hong Kong and the difficulty faced by the HKSAR to complete on their own legislation for safeguarding national security in the foreseeable future, the Central Authorities have the right and duty to introduce a national law to improve at the national level the legal framework and enforcement mechanisms for national security for the HKSAR. Such national law is under the ambit of \"defence and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the Region\" as set out in Article 18(3) of the Basic Law.",
            "Under Article 23 of the Basic Law, HKSAR is authorised to legislate national security laws, however, it does not preclude the Central Authorities from legislating at a national level for national security.",
            "As clearly stated in the draft Decision and the Explanatory Statement of the draft Decision, when making the Decision, the NPC will comply with the laws, the \"one country, two systems\" principle and also endeavour to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of people in Hong Kong.",
            "Article 2 of the Basic Law clearly stipulates that the HKSAR enjoys executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. Article 85 also states that the HKSAR courts shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. The independence of the Judiciary is respected and upheld in the HKSAR.",
            "Given that the details of the national security law to be enacted by the NPCSC and introduced to Annex III of the Basic Law to be promulgated by the HKSAR are not yet made public at this stage, it is inappropriate for anyone to make unwarranted speculations on the content of the legislation.",
            "The HKSAR Government would continue to provide explanation when necessary. It is hoped that members of the public would understand in an objective manner.",

            "近日法律界就有關建立健全香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的決定（草案）（《決定》）表達了不同意見，律政司發言人今日（五月二十五日）作出以下聲明回應關注：",
            "全國人民代表大會（全國人大）是中華人民共和國最高的國家權力機關。根據《中華人民共和國憲法》（《憲法》），全國人大有權制定法律及其他法律文書包括作出決定。《決定》是根據《憲法》第三十一條、第六十二條（二）、（十四）和（十六）以及《基本法》相關條文所作出。根據《決定》第六條，全國人大授權全國人大常務委員會（人大常委會）制定適用於香港特別行政區的維護國家安全法律。",
            "國家安全屬於中央事權，並不在香港特別行政區的自治範圍之內。鑑於香港現時情況，以及香港特別行政區在可見未來，自行就維護國家安全完成立法所面對的困難，中央有權力亦有責任制定全國性法律，從國家層面改善香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。有關的全國性法律是屬於《基本法》第十八條（三）下的「國防、外交和其他按《基本法》規定不屬於香港特別行政區自治範圍的法律」。",
            "根據《基本法》第二十三條，香港特別行政區獲授權訂立國家安全法，然而，這並不影響中央在國家層面為維護國家安全立法的權力。",
            "《決定》及相關《說明》已清晰指出，全國人大會根據法律與「一國兩制」方針作出決定，並切實保障香港居民合法權益。",
            "《基本法》第二條清楚訂明香港特別行政區享有行政管理權、立法權、獨立的司法權和終審權。《基本法》第八十五條亦表明，香港特別行政區法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。司法獨立在香港特別行政區獲得尊重與保障。",
            "將會由人大常委會制定、並列入《基本法》附件三以及由香港特別行政區公布的國家安全法，細節現時尚未公布，任何人都不適宜對該法案內容作出毫無根據的揣測。",
            "香港特別行政區政府將繼續在有需要時就議題作出解釋，希望公眾人士對此能夠客觀理解。",
