            "More than 300 Mainland legal professionals, representatives of enterprises and government officials attended a \"Seminar on the Legal and Dispute Resolution Services in Hong Kong\" in Beijing today (August 19) to better understand Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services and business environment, as well as to strengthen the exchanges and co-operation with Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services sectors.",
            "The Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, delivered a speech at the seminar's opening ceremony. He said that there was plenty of room for co-operation between the Mainland and the HKSAR in the areas of legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "He noted that the relations between Hong Kong and Beijing, including trade and investment relations, have been very close. Hong Kong is Beijing's largest source of foreign investment. Moreover, as an international financial centre, many Beijing enterprises opted for Hong Kong as their investment base.",
            "\"The number of Mainland enterprises opting to 'go global' and foreign enterprises making investments in the Mainland will be on the rise as a result of the Belt and Road vision and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,\" he said.",
            "\"Mainland enterprises should consider learning more about international trade and investment laws as well as cross-boundary trade dispute resolution services in order to prepare for 'going global'. Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution professionals can provide professional and diversified services for Mainland enterprises in this regard.\"",
            "Mr Yuen stressed that Hong Kong has rich experience in international legal and dispute resolution services. Under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle, Hong Kong has a well-established legal system which has earned international recognition. Hong Kong can act as a neutral venue and provide dispute resolution services when disputes arise between Mainland and foreign enterprises.",
            "The presence of world-class arbitration institutions is another distinguishing feature of Hong Kong. The establishment of offices by internationally renowned arbitration institutions in Hong Kong not only indicates their recognition of Hong Kong's status as an international arbitration centre in the Asia Pacific region, but also equips Hong Kong to better provide high-end and diversified dispute resolution services.",
            "He also said that apart from arbitration, Hong Kong is committed to promoting mediation services. Resolving disputes by mediation is economical and allows more flexibility in reaching settlement agreements that will satisfy all parties when compared to litigation. It can also reduce the negative impact of disputes on the relationship of both sides.",
            "The \"Seminar on the Legal and Dispute Resolution Services in Hong Kong\" is jointly organised by the Beijing Office of the HKSAR Government, the Department of Justice, the Ministry of Justice and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). Co-organisers include Invest Hong Kong of the HKSAR Government, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in China, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, the Beijing Investment Promotion Bureau and the Beijing Chinese Overseas Friendship Association.",
            "Also attending today's seminar were the Director of the Beijing Office, Ms Gracie Foo, and the Vice-Chairman of the CCPIT, Mr Yin Zonghua.",

            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師在研討會的開幕禮上致辭時表示，內地與香港特區在法律和解決爭議服務方面有很大的合作空間。",
            "他指出香港和北京的關係，包括經貿投資關係，一直非常緊密。香港既是北京最大的外資來源地，也是國際金融中心，很多北京企業選擇香港作為投資基地。",
            "他說：「國家現在正推動『一帶一路』的發展策略，加上快將成立的亞洲基礎設施投資銀行，內地企業『走出去』和外地企業到內地進行大規模投資的情況將不斷增加。」",
            "「內地企業應對國際商貿投資法律和解決跨境商貿爭議服務多加了解，從而做好『走出去』的準備。在這方面，香港的法律與解決爭議專業人士可以為內地企業提供專業而多元化的服務。」",
            "袁國強強調，香港在國際法律及解決爭議服務方面有豐富經驗。在「一國兩制」下，香港的完善法律制度在國際上得到認同。當內地企業與外國企業發生爭議的時候，香港可擔當中立的第三地，提供解決爭議服務。",
            "他說香港的另一項特點，是設有世界級仲裁機構的辦事處。這些國際知名的仲裁機構在香港設立辦事處，不但代表它們肯定香港作為亞太區國際仲裁中心的地位，也令香港擁有更完備的條件去提供高端而多元化的解決爭議服務。",
            "他亦表示除仲裁外，香港也致力推動調解服務。以調解來解決爭議，符合經濟效益，相比訴訟可以更具彈性達成各方也滿意的和解協議，也能夠減低爭議對雙方關係造成的負面影響。",
            "「香港法律及解決爭議服務研討會」由香港特區政府駐北京辦事處、律政司、司法部和中國國際貿易促進委員會聯合主辦。協辦機構包括香港特區政府投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局、中國香港（地區）商會、中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會、北京市投資促進局以及北京海外聯誼會。",
            "出席今日研討會開幕禮的嘉賓還有香港特別行政區政府駐北京辦事處主任傅小慧及中國國際貿易促進委員會副會長尹宗華。",
