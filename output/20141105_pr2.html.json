            "Following is a question by the Hon Ng Leung-sing and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council today (November 5):",
            "Question:",
            "On October 20 this year, the High Court granted interim injunctions restraining participants of the assemblies triggered by the Occupy Central movement from continued occupation of certain passageways in Mong Kok and obstruction of the entrance to the car park, the fire access and emergency vehicular access of a building in Admiralty. Protesters are also forbidden to obstruct the plaintiffs from removing the obstacles in question. However, some protesters refused to obey the injunctions. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it knows the total number of interim and formal injunctions granted by the High Court in the past five years, and the enforcement situation of such injunctions; and",
            "(2) as some protesters refused to obey the aforesaid injunctions, what actions the law enforcement agencies intend to carry out; whether, in the light of this incident, the authorities will consider comprehensively reviewing and improving the mechanism for enforcing injunctions?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's success and the Government places great importance in upholding the rule of law. Amongst others, respect for the authority of the Court is a fundamental aspect of the concept of the rule of law. Court orders, including injunction orders (whether interim or permanent), should be fully respected and strictly followed. Even if a party does not agree that an injunction should be granted, the party should lodge an appeal or make other appropriate application to the relevant Court pursuant to the relevant procedure instead of deliberately acting in breach of the injunction. Loss of respect for the Courts and the orders they make will erode the rule of law, which in turn will cause harm to our society.",
            "The Government's reply to the Member's question is as follows:",
            "(1) Application for injunction is a type of civil proceeding dealt with by the Courts. We have consulted the Judiciary on this part of the question. We have been advised that the Judiciary does not have readily available statistics on the number of injunctions granted by the Courts in the past five years.",
            "Enforcement of injunctions is generally dealt with by the parties to the relevant civil proceedings, although the Bailiffs will render assistance as and when appropriate and Judges will deal with such applications as may be incidental to the enforcement of injunctions. According to its records, the Judiciary has received a total of six applications in the past five years requesting the assistance of the Bailiffs in the serving of injunction orders. All of the orders in these six requests have been duly served.",
            "(2) Since applications for injunction are civil (as opposed to criminal) in nature, they are generally and mostly handled by private litigants. Accordingly, in the absence of specific Court direction or order, the Police are generally not involved in the enforcement of an injunction order. However, the Police have a statutory duty under the Police Force Ordinance, Cap 232 to take appropriate actions if a breach of the peace occurs or when suspected criminal acts have been committed. If the relevant Court order expressly directs the Police to perform certain specified acts for the purpose of assisting a party to enforce an injunction, the Police will provide such assistance as is specified in the relevant Court order.",
            "An injunction is a solemn order made by the Court and that it is in the overall and long-term interests of the rule of law and the proper administration of justice that all injunction orders should be complied with. With a view to protecting the due administration of justice (which is fundamental to the upholding of the rule of law), the Government (through the Police or otherwise) is ready and willing to assist in the enforcement of the injunction orders in such ways as the Court may find it appropriate to direct.",
            "As regards the specific cases referred to in the question, before the Court hands down its judgments, the Police will continue to dispatch appropriate manpower and make appropriate deployment to maintain public order and protect public safety. The Government also urges those who are unlawfully blocking the roads should strictly and fully observe the relevant Court orders as soon as possible.",
            "On the mechanism for enforcing injunctions, the Government will, as usual, keep the relevant law under review and will consider the need of any reform as and when necessary.",

            "以下為今日（十一月五日）在立法會會議上吳亮星議員的提問和律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "高等法院在本年十月二十日頒下臨時禁制令，禁止佔領中環運動所引發的集會的參加者繼續佔領旺角若干條街道和阻塞金鐘一幢大廈的停車場出入口、消防通道及緊急車輛通道，而示威人士亦不得阻礙原告人清除有關障礙物。然而，有示威人士拒絕遵行該等禁制令。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）是否知悉在過去五年，高等法院共頒下多少項臨時及正式的禁制令，以及該等禁制令的執行情況為何；及",
            "（二）鑑於有示威人士拒絕遵行上述禁制令，執法部門擬採取的行動為何；因應是次事件，當局會否考慮全面檢討及改善禁制令的執行機制？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "法治是香港賴以成功的基石，政府對維護法治高度重視。法治有多項根本要素，而尊重法院權威是其中之一。法庭命令，包括臨時或永久禁制令，都必須絕對尊重並嚴格遵從。其中一方即使不同意法院頒下禁制令，也應依照有關程序向相關法院提出上訴或其他適當的申請，而非故意違抗禁制令。不尊重法院及法院所作的命令會侵蝕法治，以致對本港社會造成傷害。",
            "政府就議員的問題答覆如下：",
            "（一）申請禁制令是由法院處理的其中一類民事法律程序。我們已就這部分的問題諮詢司法機構，並收到回覆表示，司法機構並無備存法院在過去五年所頒發禁制令的統計數字。",
            "禁制令的強制執行事宜一般由涉及相關民事法律程序的各方處理，但執達主任會在適當情況下提供協助，而法官也會處理由強制執行禁制令所衍生的申請。根據司法機構的記錄，司法機構在過去五年接獲要求執達主任協助送達禁制令的申請共六宗，當中所涉的禁制令均已妥為送達。",
            "（二）由於禁制令的申請屬民事（而非刑事）性質，大部分申請一般均由私人訴訟人處理。因此，如沒有具體的法庭指示或命令，警方一般不會參與強制執行禁制令。但《警隊條例》（第232章）賦權警方在有人破壞社會安寧或作出懷疑刑事作為時，採取適當行動。如有法庭命令明確指示警方作出某些指明作為，以協助有關一方執行禁制令，警方會提供有關的法庭命令所指明的協助。",
            "禁制令是由法院頒發的嚴肅命令，遵從所有法院發出的禁制令才符合法治及妥善執行司法的整體長遠利益。為保障妥善執行司法（這是維護法治的基礎），政府已準備好並願意按法院所指示其認為恰當的方式，透過警方或其他部門協助強制執行有關禁制令。",
            "關於問題所指的情況，在法院作出判決前，警方會繼續調派適當人手及作出適當部署，以維持公共秩序及保障公共安全。政府亦呼籲仍非法堵塞道路的人士應從速嚴格和絕對遵從法庭命令。",
            "就禁制令的執行機制，政府會照常不時檢討相關法律，並在有必要時考慮是否需予改革。",
