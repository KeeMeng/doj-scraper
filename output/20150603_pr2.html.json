            "Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council today (June 3):",
            "Question:",
            "The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) handed down a judgment last month that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (Chinachem Foundation) was to hold an estate of tens of billion of Hong Kong dollars as a trustee and would not receive the estate as an absolute gift. In addition, as the will indicated that the testatrix wished to \"entrust\" the supervision of the Foundation to a managing organisation outside the Foundation, CFA would exercise its inherent jurisdiction to establish a scheme for the administration of the charitable trusts. Following the handing down of the judgment, the Secretary for Justice (SJ) told the media that the Department of Justice would discuss with the relevant parties, including the Chinachem Foundation, the arrangements for and the details of the execution of the will. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether SJ will, in following up the CFA judgment, examine the past position concerning the administration of the estate, including checking and recovering all the unauthorised expenditures;",
            "(2) whether it has initiated investigations to ascertain if the persons concerned have acted with negligence or wilful intent or even in conspiracy to commit a breach of trust in handling the estate; if it has, of the progress of the investigations; if not, the reasons for that;",
            "(3) whether SJ, as the protector of charities, has monitored the operation, expenditure and debt positions of the Chinachem Foundation; if he has, of the details; and",
            "(4) whether SJ has approached the persons nominated in the aforesaid will for appointment as members of the managing organisation (e.g. the Premier of the State Council) to gain an understanding of whether they are willing to be appointed and to discuss with them how the Chinachem Foundation is to be supervised; if he has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Since December 10, 2007, the Estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang referred to in the question (the Estate) has, in accordance with a court order, been administered and preserved by independent interim administrators appointed by the court. All the interim administrators are professional accountants. The judgment of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) dated May 18, 2015 does not affect the current independent interim administrators' discharge of the abovementioned duties to manage and preserve the Estate in accordance with the court's appointment order until any further court order.",
            "A consolidated reply to part (1) to (4) of the question raised by the Hon Paul Tse is set out in the ensuing paragraphs.",
            "Pursuant to the court's order, the interim administrators are authorised to manage the properties and affairs of the Estate. Their principal responsibilities are to get in and preserve the properties of the Estate, including making enquiries as they deem reasonably necessary or taking out relevant legal proceedings, and requiring any person(s) having custody, control or management of properties of the Estate to deliver or transfer to the interim administrators such properties, so as to ensure that the Estate is properly preserved.",
            "Except with the prior consent of both the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (the Foundation) or the court's consent, the interim administrators shall not distribute any part of the Estate, and no unauthorised person shall use any property of the Estate.",
            "The interim administrators, being \"officers of the court\", owe a duty to the court on matters relating to the interim administration of the Estate and the court may give directions to the interim administrators if and when necessary. In discharge of their duties, the interim administrators shall investigate and take follow up actions against any irregularity known to them which may prejudice the proper preservation and management of the Estate. The interim administrators are also required to submit periodical reports to the court, the DoJ and the Foundation on the conduct of the administration.",
            "The DoJ has, at all times, paid attention to the administration of the Estate and kept contact with the interim administrators, including considering the periodical reports provided by the interim administrators; obtaining further information from the interim administrators; requiring the interim administrators to take follow up actions and provide report as the circumstances require; assisting the court in legal proceedings taken out by the interim administrators in the course of interim administration; and making applications to or seeking guidance from the court on the interim administration of the Estate as may be required.",
            "By its judgment dated May 18, the CFA held that the Foundation would hold Mrs Nina Wang's Estate as a trustee, rather than receiving it as an unconditional absolute gift. The judgment has clarified the proper interpretation of the Will at law, and provided a legal basis and clear guidance for the future implementation of the Will.",
            "As the protector of charities, the Secretary for Justice (SJ) is necessarily a party to charity proceedings and represents the beneficial interest or objects of the charity. Upon detailed consideration of the CFA's judgment, the DoJ will actively follow up on the detailed arrangements for the implementation of Mrs Nina Wang's Will, including continuing to keep in contact with the Foundation as the trustee of the Estate and approaching other persons concerned, discussing the follow-up actions required and seeking guidance from the court as may be required.",
            "As regards whether SJ has monitored the affairs of the Foundation, including its operation, expenditure and debts, charities are generally allowed to operate autonomously under their own governing bodies and in accordance with their own rules and regulations. Except otherwise prescribed by statute, the charity may operate autonomously and decide the manner in which the public is to be informed about its operation. Unless there is sufficient information or evidence which suggests a potential breach of charitable trust or maladministration on the part of any charities, thus prejudicing the beneficial interest of the charities, the DoJ is not a \"regulator\" as such and would not regulate the daily management and operation of individual charities.",
            "DoJ will continue to closely monitor the interim administrators' work in managing and preserving the Estate and the litigation involving the Foundation, and take such follow up actions as may be appropriate, with a view to protecting and safeguarding the interest of the charity.",

            "以下是今日（六月三日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問及律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "終審法院上月裁定，華懋慈善基金有限公司（華懋基金）是以受託人形式持有數百億元遺產，而不是以無條件饋贈形式接收有關遺產。此外，鑑於遺囑顯示立遺囑人希望將該基金「交託」由該基金以外管理機構監管，終審法院將運用本身固有司法管轄權，為該慈善信託制訂管理計劃。律政司司長在裁決頒布後向傳媒表示，律政司會就遺囑執行安排及細節與有關各方（包括華懋基金）磋商。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）律政司司長跟進終審法院判決時，會否審查該筆遺產過去管理狀況，包括查核及追討所有未獲授權開支；",
            "（二）有否主動調查相關人士在處理該筆遺產時有否疏忽或蓄意甚至串謀違反信託行為；如有，調查進度為何；如否，原因為何；",
            "（三）律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，有否監察華懋基金的運作、開支及債務狀況；如有，詳情為何；及",
            "（四）律政司司長有否接觸獲上述遺囑提名為管理機構成員人士（例如國務院總理），以了解他們是否願意及商討如何監管華懋基金；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "問題所涉及的已故龔如心的遺產自二○○七年十二月十日起，按照法庭所頒的命令由法庭委任的獨立臨時遺產管理人管理和保存。有關獨立臨時遺產管理人一直由專業會計師擔任。終審法院在本年五月十八日的判決並不影響現任獨立臨時遺產管理人在現階段繼續按法庭的委任履行上述妥善管理和保存該筆遺產的職責，直至法庭另有頒發命令為止。",
            "就謝偉俊議員的第（一）至（四）項提問，現綜合回覆如下。",
            "按照法庭的命令，臨時遺產管理人獲授權管理該筆遺產中的財產及相關事務，其主要職責是查明和保護該筆遺產內的財產，包括作出合理及必要的查詢或開展相關法律程序，以及要求任何保管、控制及管理屬於該筆遺產的財產的人士交出及轉移有關財產予臨時遺產管理人，以確保該筆遺產得以妥善保存。",
            "除非預先得到律政司及華懋慈善基金有限公司（華懋慈善基金）雙方的同意或法庭批准，臨時遺產管理人不得分配該筆遺產，任何未獲授權的人士亦不可擅自動用遺產內的財產。",
            "臨時遺產管理人作為「法院人員」，須就遺產管理事宜向法庭負責，而法庭亦有權在有需要時向臨時遺產管理人頒布指令。在其職責範圍內，臨時遺產管理人會調查及跟進其知悉的任何有損該筆遺產的妥善保存和運用的不當行為。臨時遺產管理人亦須定期向法庭、律政司及華懋慈善基金遞交報告，交代遺產管理的情況。",
            "律政司一直關注該筆遺產的管理狀況，並與臨時遺產管理人保持聯繫，包括審閱臨時遺產管理人的定期報告、按情況及需要進一步向臨時遺產管理人了解相關事宜、要求臨時遺產管理人作出跟進和匯報、在有需要時協助法庭處理臨時遺產管理人在過程中提出的法律程序，以及在有需要時就遺產管理事宜向法庭提出申請或尋求指示。",
            "終審法院剛於五月十八日就龔如心遺囑所作的判決，即華懋慈善基金是以受託人的身分持有該筆遺產，而不是以無條件饋贈形式接收有關遺產，釐清了遺囑在法理上的適當詮釋，為往後執行遺囑提供了清晰的法律基礎和指引。",
            "律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，是慈善法律程序的必然一方，並且代表慈善組織的實益權益或宗旨。律政司在詳細研究終審法院的判詞後，會積極跟進龔如心遺囑執行方面的安排及細節，包括繼續與作為遺產信託人的華懋慈善基金保持聯繫及接觸其他相關人士，商討各項跟進工作及在有需要時向法庭尋求指示。",
            "至於律政司司長有否監察華懋慈善基金的運作、開支及債務狀況等事宜，一般而言，各類慈善組織可以在各自的決策組織下，按照本身的組織章程大綱和章程細則獨立運作。除法例另有規定外，有關慈善組織可自行運作和決定如何向公眾作出交代。除非有充分資料或證據顯示任何慈善組織有可能出現違反慈善信託或行政失當從而損害慈善組織的實益權益，律政司並非主動規管慈善組織的日常管理和營運的「規管者」。",
            "律政司會繼續密切關注臨時遺產管理人就遺產的管理和保存的工作，以及牽涉華懋慈善基金的法律訴訟，並在有需要時作出適當的跟進，以維護及保障相關的慈善利益。",
