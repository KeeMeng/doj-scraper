            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, and the Director of Public Prosecutions (Designate), Mr Keith Yeung, SC, to the media today (August 1):",
            "Secretary for Justice: Dear friends from the media, the purpose of today's meeting is to announce the Government's appointment of Mr Keith Yeung Kar-hung, SC, to succeed Mr Kevin Zervos, SC, as the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who will leave the civil service in September.",
            "A prosecution service that is fair, just, in accordance with the law and free from political intervention is of fundamental importance in maintaining the rule of law. The Department of Justice (DoJ) has all along placed great emphasis on the quality of our prosecution work.",
            "In November 2012, the DoJ conducted a promotion-cum-open recruitment exercise so as to source a suitable candidate for the post of DPP. After the selection process which took more than six months, the Selection Committee chaired by the Secretary for the Civil Service considered Mr Yeung to be the most suitable candidate and decided to appoint him as the next DPP.",
            "With over 25 years of experience in the legal profession, Mr Yeung has a wealth of experience and an in-depth knowledge in criminal law and civil law, especially commercial crime and securities-related legal matters.",
            "Over the years, Mr Yeung has been actively involved in legal and related services. As the Vice-chairman of the Bar Association as well as in other capacities, he has been involved in different areas of work for promoting the development of legal services and the legal profession.",
            "Further, Mr Yeung is no stranger to the work of the Government. He has been involved in various public services, including Chairman of the Non-local Higher and Professional Education Appeal Board and Deputy Chairman of the Appeal Board Panel (Town Planning).",
            "Mr Yeung enjoys a very good reputation in the Bar. I am confident that he will bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the DoJ, and that he will discharge his role as the DPP in a fair and balanced manner. I and my colleagues in the DoJ very much look forward to working with him.",
            "Last but certainly not least, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my special gratitude to the incumbent DPP, Mr Kevin Zervos, SC, for his valuable service in the DoJ for over 21 years. During his tenure as the DPP, he has strived to uphold the rule of law by handling prosecutions in a just and impartial manner. He has also been active in promoting community awareness of the rule of law by organising a number of public activities, such as the Prosecution Week, which has been held twice, to enhance public understanding of the rule of law and criminal prosecution. His outstanding performance has won the recognition and praise of the Government as well as members of the legal profession. I wish Mr Zervos, SC, every success in whatever new venture he will take up.",
            "Now I would invite Mr Yeung to say a few words.",
            "Director of Public Prosecutions (Designate): Dear friends, I am glad to meet you today. This is my very first time in this capacity.",
            "The system of criminal prosecutions is a vital aspect of the Hong Kong legal system. Its key objective is to uphold the rule of law. To achieve that, we need an independent, fair, impartial and open system of public prosecutions.",
            "Under Article 63 of the Basic Law, the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference.",
            "Over the years, the Secretary for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions and members of the 400-strong Prosecutions Division of the Department have been striving to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong. They have conducted criminal prosecutions with a high degree of professionalism and competence. Their efforts are well recognised by the international community.",
            "Now I am privileged and I am glad to join them as a member. I look forward to working with them and to have a productive relationship with them.",
            "In discharging the duties of the Director of Public Prosecutions, I will try my utmost. I will uphold the prosecutorial independence preserved and vested upon the Department of Justice by the Basic Law. I will handle all criminal prosecutions in a fair and impartial manner. I will be guided by the public interest. I will uphold the rule of law.",
            "I look forward to working with all the colleagues and the team in the Department of Justice. We will together to handle criminal prosecutions in Hong Kong in a fair, independent, impartial and professional manner. Thank you.",
            "Reporter: What have you done to make up the knowledge of DoJ and what is the most pressing issue for you?",
            "Director of Public Prosecutions (Designate): As perceived lack of experience is concerned, I have been practising for 25 years. Over the 25 years, I've never ceased practising in criminal law. In fact, criminal law has always been a very important aspect of my practice. So when defending, I have the chance to observe how the prosecution works and in fact over the years, I have also done prosecution works on behalf of the Department of Justice. So in that regard I am confident I have enough experience and knowledge about the operation of the Department of Justice. In any event it is also very important that we are not talking about an individual. We are talking about a team. Within the Department of Justice, there is a team of highly professional and experienced lawyers. And no doubt we will work together and achieve prosecutions and prosecution policies in accordance with the established policies.",
            "Reporter: Mr Yeung is not promoted from the people working in the DoJ. Do you think morale will be affected?",
            "Secretary for Justice: As I said in my opening, we conducted an open recruitment-cum-promotion exercise. The reason why we embark upon that exercise is to ensure that we can source the best candidate from both the private Bar as well as internally within the Department of Justice. Our aim is to ensure that we have (a) identified all the best candidates and (b) to ensure the most appropriate candidate will be appointed as the next Director of Public Prosecutions. I can assure you that all the colleagues in the Prosecutions Division understand the reason why we embark upon that exercise and there will be no negative impact on the morale of all the colleagues in the Prosecutions Division. Indeed on the contrary as I said earlier, I myself and all the colleagues within the Department of Justice, including those colleagues in the Prosecutions Division, are very much looking forward to work with and co-operate with Mr Keith Yeung, SC. Thank you very much.",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師與候任刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師今日（八月一日）會見傳媒的談話全文︰",
            "律政司司長︰今日同大家見面的目的，是向大家宣布政府已經決定委任楊家雄資深大律師為下一任的刑事檢控專員，並將於九月九日正式上任。",
            "持平、公正、依法及不受政治干預的刑事檢控工作，是維護法治的重要一環。律政司一直非常重視刑事檢控工作的質素。",
            "律政司在去年十一月底開展了「內部晉升及公開招聘」工作，尋找合適的人士出任刑事檢控專員一職。經過超過半年的遴選程序，由公務員事務局局長主持的遴選委員會，認為楊先生是最合適的人選，並因此決定委任他為下一任的刑事檢控專員。",
            "楊先生在法律界已經服務超過二十五年，無論在刑事、民事方面的工作，特別是商業罪案及與證券有關的法律事務，楊先生都有非常豐富的經驗及深厚的法律知識。",
            "楊先生過去多年來亦積極參與法律界及相關工作。他曾經以大律師公會的副主席及其他身分參與大律師公會的工作，積極推動法律服務及業界的發展。",
            "楊先生對政府的工作亦絕不陌生，他曾經參與多項公職工作，包括「非本地高等及專業教育上訴委員會」主席，及「上訴委員團（城市規劃）」副主席。",
            "楊先生在業內享有十分良好的聲譽，我深信楊先生會為律政司引進豐富的經驗和專業才能，以公正和持平的態度履行刑事檢控專員的職責，我和律政司的其他同事十分期待與楊先生合作。",
            "最後，我希望藉此機會衷心感謝現任的刑事檢控專員薛偉成資深大律師。他服務了律政司超過二十一年，他出色的工作表現，備受政府及法律界人士的尊崇及讚許。",
            "薛偉成資深大律師在任期間，一直致力維護法治，以公正和不偏不倚的態度處理檢控工作。他亦積極推廣法治的普及工作，舉辦了多項公開活動，例如已經舉辦了兩屆的「檢控週」，大大加強市民對法治及刑事檢控工作的認識。我衷心祝願他有更美好的新發展。",
            "我現在邀請楊家雄資深大律師與大家說幾句話。",
            "候任刑事檢控專員︰各位傳媒朋友，很高興今日與大家第一次見面。刑事檢察制度是香港法律制度重要的一環，其最重要的目的是維護香港的法治精神。在這方面，擁有一個獨立、公平、公正及公開的刑事檢察制度，對維護香港司法制度和維護香港法治這個香港最重要的核心價值，至為重要。",
            "根據《基本法》第６３條，香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉。",
            "在過去的日子，律政司司長、刑事檢控專員及刑事檢控科四百多位同事，一直捍衞香港的法治，以高度專業的水準及精神進行刑事檢察工作，深受國際社會的認同。",
            "我非常高與能加入成為他們其中一分子，我期望與他們有非常愉快的合作。",
            "各位，在履行刑事檢控專員的職責時，我會竭盡所能，堅守《基本法》第６３條賦與律政司獨立主理香港刑事檢察的權力；我會不偏不倚，我會大公無私，我會以社會及市民的利益為依歸，我會維護香港的法治。",
            "我極期待與律政司的團隊繼續公正、獨立、客觀和專業地處理香港刑事檢控工作。多謝各位。",
            "記者︰為何會揀選楊先生？是否基於楊先生在商業罪案和證券方面的知識，方便處理新地案或商交所案？問楊先生，有否信心處理這些大案？",
            "律政司司長︰楊家雄先生是一位資深的大律師，他在法律工作方面，無論在民事、刑事，都有豐富經驗。特別在刑事方面，他在不同類型的刑事案件，包括商業的刑事案件和與證券有關的案件有非常良好和豐富的經驗，而且一直在業界享負盛名。我對楊先生在專業方面的知識絕對有信心，亦絕對對楊先生領導才能方面有信心，可以領導律政司刑事檢控科其他同事面對將來的艱巨刑事檢控工作。",
            "候任刑事檢控專員︰就着我的經驗，我多年來接觸不同的刑事官司，特別是涉及商業罪案、訛騙以及有關股市買賣各方面的問題，我有經驗和有信心。就這位朋友問，就一些大案，在我心目中，案件沒有分大小，任何案件都影響人的一生，所有案件都會依足檢控指引和政策，根據我們的專業，考慮所有的證據和一切情況後，作出決定。我特別強調，任何案件無分大小，特別所謂政治，於刑事檢控專員來說，於刑事檢控政策來說，這完全不是一個考慮因素。",
            "記者︰司長，可否談談律政司決定不檢控林奮強？楊先生，你對於林奮強這些商業買賣涉及的案件有何看法？",
            "律政司司長︰有關林奮強先生的事件，由於他與我同時是行政會議成員，所以當事件發生時，我已經為了避嫌，亦根據以往一向的做法，授權現任刑事檢控專員處理此事。我作為律政司司長，確保處理這事的程序大公無私。就這事件，我理解約於五時左右，現任刑事檢控專員會與傳媒詳細解釋他的決定。簡單來說，第一，刑事檢控專員親自看過有關的證據和相關法例，他認為不應該進行任何檢控工作。第二，為了程序公義，為了這件比較敏感的事情對香港市民有好的交代，我們轉聘了外間獨立的刑事資深大律師，一位非常資深的刑事資深大律師，獨立地給予專業法律意見。這位資深大律師亦是最後作出結論，法律上不應有任何檢控行動。第三，廉政公署的Operations Review Committee（審查貪污舉報諮詢委員會）亦有檢視此案，亦同意我剛才提及的刑事檢控專員的意見，以及外間獨立資深大律師的意見。至於有關詳情，在五時十五分，現任刑事檢控專員會有詳細解釋，大家可留待當時提出。",
            "記者︰陳茂波案進展如何？",
            "律政司司長︰就陳茂波事件，我們知道有市民向廉政公署作出投訴。正如日前律政司發出的聲明，我亦以一貫做法，將這事授權刑事檢控專員處理。現階段因為這情況不方便向大家作進一步評論。",
            "記者︰兩位與發起佔領中環的戴耀廷副教授是大學同學，如果日後有關佔領中環的檢控工作，你會如何處理？是否有需要避嫌？",
            "律政司司長︰我可以清楚向大家說明，無論是同學關係，或者其他朋友，或者其他關係，絕對絕對不會影響我們處理律政司工作，無論是民事或刑事檢控的工作。第二點我希望強調的是，現行制度，特別是律政司一直沿用的制度，在某一個案事件，若有需要的話，有完善制度避嫌，或作出相關的措施。所以剛才這位傳媒朋友所說，我們與戴耀廷副教授的關係是大學同學，不會影響我們處理工作時，仍然保持公平公正和依法辦事的態度。",
            "記者︰專員上任後會否加快處理曾蔭權案？",
            "候任刑事檢控專員︰正如我剛才所說，我會竭盡全力，盡快處理我需要處理的案件。現階段，直到今日，我仍然是個求職者，所以我仍未看有關檔案，亦不應該有機會看。所以，就個別案件，無論社會有多關心該案件，我無從幫助。我強調，我會竭盡全力，盡快處理我應做的事情。",

            "就這位朋友問，就一些大案，在我心目中，案件沒有分大小，任何案件都影響人的一生，所有案件都會依足檢控指引和政策，根據我們的專業，考慮所有的證據和一切情況後，作出決定",
            "我特別強調，任何案件無分大小，特別所謂政治，於刑事檢控專員來說，於刑事檢控政策來說，這完全不是一個考慮因素",
            "記者︰司長，可否談談律政司決定不檢控林奮強？楊先生，你對於林奮強這些商業買賣涉及的案件有何看法？",
            "律政司司長︰有關林奮強先生的事件，由於他與我同時是行政會議成員，所以當事件發生時，我已經為了避嫌，亦根據以往一向的做法，授權現任刑事檢控專員處理此事",
            "我作為律政司司長，確保處理這事的程序大公無私",
            "就這事件，我理解約於五時左右，現任刑事檢控專員會與傳媒詳細解釋他的決定",
            "簡單來說，第一，刑事檢控專員親自看過有關的證據和相關法例，他認為不應該進行任何檢控工作",
            "第二，為了程序公義，為了這件比較敏感的事情對香港市民有好的交代，我們轉聘了外間獨立的刑事資深大律師，一位非常資深的刑事資深大律師，獨立地給予專業法律意見",
            "這位資深大律師亦是最後作出結論，法律上不應有任何檢控行動",
            "至於有關詳情，在五時十五分，現任刑事檢控專員會有詳細解釋，大家可留待當時提出",
            "記者︰陳茂波案進展如何？",
            "律政司司長︰就陳茂波事件，我們知道有市民向廉政公署作出投訴",
            "正如日前律政司發出的聲明，我亦以一貫做法，將這事授權刑事檢控專員處理",
            "現階段因為這情況不方便向大家作進一步評論",
            "記者︰兩位與發起佔領中環的戴耀廷副教授是大學同學，如果日後有關佔領中環的檢控工作，你會如何處理？是否有需要避嫌？",
            "律政司司長︰我可以清楚向大家說明，無論是同學關係，或者其他朋友，或者其他關係，絕對絕對不會影響我們處理律政司工作，無論是民事或刑事檢控的工作",
            "第二點我希望強調的是，現行制度，特別是律政司一直沿用的制度，在某一個案事件，若有需要的話，有完善制度避嫌，或作出相關的措施",
            "所以剛才這位傳媒朋友所說，我們與戴耀廷副教授的關係是大學同學，不會影響我們處理工作時，仍然保持公平公正和依法辦事的態度",
            "記者︰專員上任後會否加快處理曾蔭權案？",
            "候任刑事檢控專員︰正如我剛才所說，我會竭盡全力，盡快處理我需要處理的案件",
            "現階段，直到今日，我仍然是個求職者，所以我仍未看有關檔案，亦不應該有機會看",
            "所以，就個別案件，無論社會有多關心該案件，我無從幫助",
            "我強調，我會竭盡全力，盡快處理我應做的事情",
