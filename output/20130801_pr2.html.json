            "The following is a statement given today (August 1) by the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Department of Justice, Mr Kevin P Zervos, SC, on the case of Mr Franklin Lam Fan-keung:",
            "In late October 2012, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) received complaints against Mr Franklin Lam Fan-keung, a non-official member of the Executive Council (ExCo), which also involved his wife in relation to the sale of 4 properties held by them through various companies.",
            "At the outset of this case, the Secretary for Justice (SJ) delegated it to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in order to avoid any possible perception of bias as a result of Mr Lam being a colleague of the SJ in ExCo.",
            "The ICAC conducted a comprehensive investigation and submitted their finalised report to the DPP for consideration in late May 2013.",
            "The DPP considered the case and instructed a Senior Counsel at the Bar of Hong Kong, Mr Peter Duncan, SC, to provide an independent opinion on the issue of whether a prosecution of Mr and Mrs Lam was appropriate upon the application of the law and established prosecution policy to the evidence.",
            "Mr Duncan submitted his finalised advice to the DPP in late July 2013. He advised the DPP not to prosecute Mr and Mrs Lam.",
            "The DPP considered the opinion of Senior Counsel, the evidence, the law and all other relevant material. He concluded that there was insufficient evidence and therefore there was not a reasonable prospect of securing a conviction against Mr and Mrs Lam.",
            "The DPP explained to the SJ the basis of his decision. Having studied the materials, the SJ agreed with the decision of the DPP.",
            "Prosecution criteria",
            "According to The Statement of Prosecution Policy and Practice, a prosecutor must consider two issues in deciding whether to prosecute. First, is the evidence sufficient to justify the institution or continuation of proceedings. Second, if it is, does the public interest require a prosecution to be pursued? See paragraph 7.1.",
            "A prosecution should not be started or continued unless the prosecutor is satisfied that there is admissible, substantial and reliable evidence that a criminal offence known to the law has been committed by a person. The proper test is whether there is a reasonable prospect of a conviction. See paragraph 8.1.",
            "The complaints",
            "On July 1, 2012, Mr Lam was appointed a non-official member of ExCo. On October 27, 2012, new measures were implemented in the form of Buyer's Stamp Duty and an increased rate and extended holding period for Special Stamp Duty to regulate the property market. It was complained that Mr Lam in putting up his 4 properties for sale may have used privileged information obtained in his capacity as an ExCo member. It was also complained that in offering extra commission to the selling agent of the properties he was offering an advantage to an agent under section 9(2) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, Cap 201.",
            "The relevant offences",
            "In order to understand the decision that has been reached in this case, it is necessary to summarise the relevant aspects of the criminal offences upon which the evidence gathered was assessed.",
            "The allegations investigated by the ICAC centred on the offences of misconduct in public office and offering an advantage to an agent.",
            "The offence of Misconduct in public office is committed where:",
            "(1) a public official;",
            "(2) in the course of or in relation to his public office;",
            "(3) wilfully misconducts himself; by act or omission, for example, by wilfully neglecting or failing to perform his duty;",
            "(4) without reasonable excuse or justification; and",
            "(5) where such misconduct is serious, not trivial, having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities. See HKSAR v Shum Kwok-sher [2001] 3 HKLRD 399; HKSAR v Sin Kam-wah (2005) 8 HKCFAR 192. See also HKSAR v Wong Lin-kay [2012] 2 HKLRD 898 which requires misconduct by a public officer in relation to powers and duties exercisable by him for the public benefit.",
            "Section 9(2) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, Cap 201 (POBO) requires proof:",
            "(1) that there exists a principal/agent relationship; (See Ng Siu-chau v HKSAR (2000) 3 HKCFAR 621, HKSAR v Fung Hok-cheung [2008] 3 HKLRD 846 (CA));",
            "(2) that there be an offer to an agent that comes within the definition of those terms in ss.2(2)(a) of the POBO;",
            "(3) of an advantage within the definition in s.2(1) of the POBO;",
            "(4) that the offer of the advantage be as an inducement to, reward for or otherwise on account of;",
            "(5) that agent conducting himself in relation to his principal's affairs or business, by either",
            "(i) doing or forbearing to do an act in relation to his principal's affairs or business; or",
            "(ii) showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal's affairs or business (See Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch'ng Poh [1997] HKLRD 652(PC)).",
            "The use of confidential information",
            "As we know, on October 27, 2012 the cooling measures for the property market were implemented. From the information gathered by the ICAC, in early June 2012, Mr Lam became aware that he was to be appointed a non-official member of ExCo. At about this time, Mrs Lam engaged a property agent from a Property Agency to sell 4 properties. It was on July 1, 2012 that Mr Lam was appointed to ExCo. It was in late August 2012, that senior members of Government began to discuss implementing concrete measures to regulate the property market. On September 13, 2012, the Financial Secretary gave instructions to introduce such measures. On October 17, 2012, senior Government officials decided that specific cooling measures would be announced on October 26, 2012 to be implemented the following day. On October 25, 2012 a meeting of ExCo was arranged for October 26, 2012 to discuss the proposals. Mr Lam was not in Hong Kong at the time and did not attend the meeting.",
            "On the information available, it is clear that Mr Lam did not use such information in relation to the sale of the properties in question. According to the evidence, they were put on the market in early June 2012, well before any consideration or discussion had taken place at senior levels of Government for the implementation of cooling measures which were subsequently implemented on October 27, 2012.",
            "As stated to the ICAC by the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Housing, the proposal of the Buyer's Stamp Duty was first discussed at a meeting on August 23, 2012 and throughout the formulation of the new measures there was no consultation or discussion with any non-official member of ExCo, including Mr Lam. There does not appear to be any other means by which Mr Lam may have received or come to know about the new measures and in any event could not have done so before late August 2012 when the measures were the subject of high level discussion within Government.",
            "There was simply no evidence to support an offence of misconduct in public office against Mr Lam.",
            "Mr Lam gave two radio interviews on October 31 and November 1, 2012. In the interview on October 31, 2012, he explained that he had decided not to buy or sell any property during his term as an ExCo member in order to avoid any possible conflict of interest but wished to raise funds for meeting exigencies which might arise so he decided to sell some of his properties.",
            "The extra commission",
            "In a statement to the ICAC by the property agent, in early June 2012 when Mrs Lam engaged him to sell the 4 properties, she told him that should the properties be sold at prices higher than the bottom prices she had set, the difference could be given to the agents who had successfully facilitated the transactions as extra commission. The agent however explained to Mrs Lam that such a proposal was not feasible as the Property Agency's policy was to disclose all the commission to both the purchaser and the vendor in the preliminary Sale and Purchase Agreement and in general a purchaser would not agree to the agent collecting an extra commission. Mrs Lam responded that if that was the case, the difference would be donated. It was the only occasion that mention was made by Mrs Lam of extra commission. The agent nevertheless caused an entry to be made into the Property Agency's computer system that if the selling price exceeded the bottom price, the difference will go to the agent.",
            "The Chief Executive Officer of the Property Agency also stated that the amount of commission to be paid by the vendor and the purchaser to their respective agents, whether it be higher or lower than the usual 1% of the purchase price, had to be fully disclosed to the other party and the Property Agency.",
            "Subsequently, only 1 property was sold by the Property Agency in September 2012. The agent who transacted the sale confirmed that no extra commission was paid. Another 1 of the 4 properties was sold to the wife of a friend of Mr Lam in October 2012 without the involvement of the Property Agency or any other property agent. The other 2 properties were not sold.",
            "The agent engaged by Mrs Lam stated to the ICAC that sometime in June 2012, Mr Lam had a telephone conversation with him and told him that he was selling the properties to raise funds as he would be performing public duties on a voluntary basis. There was no mention of an extra commission.",
            "In the radio interview on October 31, 2012, Mr Lam mentioned the extra commission but in another radio interview on November 1, 2012, he added that in discussion between his wife and the agent it was suggested that the difference between the purchase price and the bottom price could be donated.",
            "There was only one discussion about the extra commission and that was between Mrs Lam and the property agent in June 2012. It was somewhat unclear and it is not certain whether it was suggested to be paid to an agent or a charity. It was inputted into the Property Agency's computer as a payment to an agent but there was discussion about it being donated. In any event, the commission payment from the records was 1% in relation to only 1 property that was sold.",
            "The payment of the extra commission was not concealed within the Property Agency. It was inputted into its computer and with respect to each of the 4 properties. It was permissible within the Property Agency for agents to receive a commission higher than 1% of the transaction price but it was required by the Property Agency that it be fully disclosed to the other party to the transaction. It cannot be said to be a secret commission between the property agent and his or her principal, the Property Agency.",
            "Senior Counsel's opinion",
            "Senior Counsel carefully evaluated the evidence and materials and advised that there was no evidence to warrant a charge of misconduct in public office against Mr Lam; there was insufficient evidence to warrant a charge of offering an advantage to an agent against Mr and Mrs Lam and no other offences were revealed.",
            "Senior Counsel concluded that there was no evidence that Mr Lam used confidential information obtained in his capacity as an ExCo member. In relation to the extra commission, he is of the view that the evidence suggested that Mrs Lam was not offering a commission that was secret. He was of the view that the compelling conclusion was that the proposal envisaged the payment to be made with the full knowledge of the principal.",
            "Conclusion",
            "A prosecution can only ever be instituted on the basis of sufficiency of evidence and it should never be started unless there is admissible, substantial and reliable evidence to justify placing a person upon trial. From the provable facts of a case, there must be a reasonable prospect of securing a conviction before a prosecution may be brought. In this case, there simply was not.",
            "The decision taken has been explained so that the public are fully and properly informed about this case which has been the subject of public concern.",

            "以下為律政司刑事檢控專員薛偉成資深大律師今日（八月一日）就林奮強案發表的聲明︰",
            "2012年10月底，廉政公署（廉署）接獲投訴，指行政會議非官守成員林奮強先生及其太太透過多間公司出售所持有4個物業。",
            "在案件開始時，律政司司長（司長）授權刑事檢控專員處理案件，避免因林先生是司長在行政會議的同事而可能產生偏頗的印象。",
            "廉署對本案展開全面調查，並於2013年5月底向刑事檢控專員提交最後報告以供考慮。",
            "刑事檢控專員研究本案，並委託香港一名資深大律師，即鄧樂勤資深大律師，引用法律及既定的檢控政策考慮證據，就應否檢控林奮強夫婦，提供獨立法律意見。",
            "2013年7月底，鄧樂勤先生向刑事檢控專員提交了最終意見，建議不檢控林奮強夫婦。",
            "刑事檢控專員考慮了資深大律師的意見、有關證據、法律及所有其他相關材料。他認為本案沒有充分證據，因而沒有合理機會使林奮強夫婦達至定罪。",
            "刑事檢控專員向司長說明他作出決定的依據。司長研究過有關材料後，同意刑事檢控專員的決定。",
            "檢控準則",
            "根據《檢控政策及常規》，檢控人員決定是否作出檢控，必須考慮兩點。首先，是否有充分證據支持提出或繼續進行法律程序？第二，假使證據充分，提出檢控是否符合公眾利益？見第7.1段。",
            "除非檢控人員認為已有可接納、實質及可靠的證據證明某人已干犯一項法律上已知的刑事罪行，否則不該提出或繼續檢控。正確的標準是衡量是否有合理機會達到定罪。見第8.1段。",
            "有關投訴",
            "2012年7月1日，林先生獲委任為行政會議非官守成員。當局在2012年10月27日推出新措施，以買家印花稅和增加特別印花稅的款額及延長其時限規管物業市場。有關投訴指林先生可能利用了他以行政會議成員身分所取得受保密權涵蓋的資料，放售4個物業。有關投訴亦指，他向代理銷售這些物業的經紀提供額外佣金的做法，是香港法例第201章《防止賄賂條例》第9（2）條所指的向代理人提供利益。",
            "相關罪行",
            "要理解本案的決定，須扼要闡述刑事罪行的相關方面，因這些方面是評估所得證據的基礎。",
            "廉署所調查的指控主要針對公職人員行為失當罪及向代理人提供利益罪。",
            "如有以下情況，即屬干犯公職人員行為失當罪：",
            "(1)犯案者為公職人員；",
            "(2)在擔任公職或與擔任公職有關的情況期間；",
            "(3)藉作為或不作為，故意作出失當行為；例如故意疏忽職守或沒有履行職責；",
            "(4)沒有合理辯解或理由；及",
            "(5)考慮到有關公職和任職者的責任、他們所尋求達致的公共目標的重要性及偏離責任的性質和程度，而釐定有關的失當行為屬於嚴重而非微不足道。請參閱香港特別行政區 訴 岑國社 [2001] 3 HKLRD 399一案；香港特別行政區 訴 冼錦華 （2005） 8 HKCFAR 192一案。另請參閱香港特別行政區 訴 黃連基 [2012] 2 HKLRD 898一案，根據該案，公職人員的行為失當必須是與他為公眾利益而可行使的權力和職責有關。",
            "第201章《防止賄賂條例》第9（2）條規定必須證明：",
            "（1）存在主事人／代理人的關係（見Ng Siu-chau 訴 香港特別行政區（2000） 3 HKCFAR 621案，香港特別行政區 訴 Fung Hok-cheung [2008] 3 HKLRD 846（CA）案）;",
            "（2）有向代理人提供利益，而情況符合《防止賄賂條例》第2（2）（a）條條款的定義；",

            "使用機密資料",
            "據我們所知，冷卻樓市措施在2012年10月27日實施。廉署搜集的資料顯示，林先生在2012年6月初知悉將獲委任為行政會議非官守成員。在差不多同一時間，林太委託某地產代理一名地產經紀出售4個物業。2012年7月1日，林先生獲委任為行政會議成員。政府高級官員在2012年8月底開始討論規管樓市的實質措施。2012年9月13日，財政司司長就推出有關措施發出指示。2012年10月17日，政府高級官員決定於2012年10月26日宣布有關的具體措施，並在翌日實施。2012年10月25日，行政會議安排在2012年10月26日舉行會議，討論有關建議。林先生當時不在香港，沒有出席會議。",
            "所得的資料清楚顯示，林先生在出售有關物業的事件中，沒有使用該等資料。根據有關證據，該等物業在2012年6月初在市場放售，遠早於政府高層就落實冷卻樓市措施作出考慮或進行討論的時間。該等措施其後在2012年10月27日實施。",
            "正如運輸及房屋局常任秘書長向廉署表示，有關買家印花稅的建議首次在2012年8月23日會議上進行討論，而在制訂有關新措施的整個過程中，並沒有徵詢行政會議任何非官守成員（包括林先生）的意見，亦沒有與他們進行討論。事件上看來，林先生沒有其他途徑可收到有關新措施的資訊或得悉這些措施。無論如何，政府高層在2012年8月底才討論這些事項，因此，他不可能在此之前收到有關措施的資訊或得悉這些措施。",
            "本案根本沒有證據證明林先生干犯了公職人員行為失當罪。",
            "林先生在2012年10月31日及11月1日接受電台訪問。他在2012年10月31日的訪問中解釋，為了避免任何可能出現的利益衝突，他決定在擔任行政會議成員期間不進行任何物業買賣，但他希望籌集資金以應付可能出現的緊急情況，於是決定出售部分物業。",
            "額外佣金",
            "根據地產經紀向廉署作出的陳述，林太在2012年6月初委託他銷售該4個物業時向他表示，如果該等物業以高於她開出的底價售出，便會把差額給予促成交易的經紀，作為額外佣金。然而，該經紀向林太解釋，這建議並不可行，原因是他所屬的地產代理的政策規定，必須在臨時買賣合約中向買賣雙方披露所有佣金，而買家一般都不會同意讓經紀收取額外佣金。林太的回應是，若然如此，便會捐出差額。這是林太唯一一次提及額外佣金。儘管如此，該名經紀仍在地產代理的電腦系統輸入一項資料，說明假若售價高於底價，差額便歸該名經紀所有。",
            "地產代理的行政總裁亦表示，賣家和買家向各自的經紀支付的佣金金額，不論是高於或低於一般的購入價的1%，均須向另一方和地產代理全面披露。",
            "其後該地產代理只在2012年9月賣出1個物業。負責該宗買賣交易的經紀確認並無獲支付額外佣金。2012年10月，林先生向朋友的妻子售出該4個物業中的另外一個，當中沒有牽涉該地產代理或任何其他地產經紀。其他兩個物業均沒有售出。",
            "林太委託的經紀向廉署表明，在2012年6月某天，林先生在與他的電話對話中表示將會義務擔任公職，因此出售有關物業以籌措資金。其間並無提及額外佣金。",
            "在2012年10月31日的電台訪問中，林先生提及額外佣金，但在11月1日的電台訪問中，他補充說，把賣價與底價之間的差價捐出的建議曾在他太太與經紀討論期間提出。",
            "有關額外佣金的討論，只在2012年6月林太與物業經紀之間進行了一次。但該討論並沒有清楚或明確指出究竟是建議把額外款項付予經紀或慈善組織。雖然物業代理的電腦將有關款項記錄為交付經紀的款項，但亦有討論提及捐出該筆款項。不管如何，記錄顯示所涉及支付了的佣金，就只有唯一售出的物業的1%佣金。",
            "支付額外佣金一事在該地產代理內部並無隱瞞。就所涉及的4項物業的額外佣金一事已輸入了公司電腦。該地產代理容許經紀收取超出成交價1%的款項作為佣金，但規定必須全面披露予交易的另一方。該筆佣金不能視為經紀與其主事人（即地產代理）之間的秘密佣金。",
            "資深大律師的意見",
            "資深大律師審慎評估證據及材料後，認為沒有證據支持對林先生控以公職人員行為不當罪，也沒有足夠證據支持對林奮強夫婦控以向代理人提供利益罪，亦沒有發現任何其他罪行。",
            "資深大律師的結論是，沒有證據證明林先生使用了以其行政會議成員身分所取得的機密資料。至於額外佣金方面，他認為有關證據顯示，林太並沒有提供秘密佣金。他認為，令人信服的結論是，有關建議是預期在主事人完全知悉的情況下支付款項。",
            "結語",
            "檢控必須在證據充分的情況下提出。除非已有可接納、實質及可靠的證據把某人交付審訊，否則便不應作出檢控。提出檢控前，必須確定案件的可證明事實具有合理機會達至定罪。而本案明顯未達到這項標準。",
            "我們已解釋所作的決定，讓市民對這宗備受社會關注的案件有全面和充分的了解。",

            "The allegations investigated by the ICAC centred on the offences of misconduct in public office and offering an advantage to an agent.",
            "The offence of Misconduct in public office is committed where:",
            "(1) a public official;",
            "(2) in the course of or in relation to his public office;",
            "(3) wilfully misconducts himself; by act or omission, for example, by wilfully neglecting or failing to perform his duty;",
            "(4) without reasonable excuse or justification; and",
            "(5) where such misconduct is serious, not trivial, having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities",
            "See HKSAR v Shum Kwok-sher [2001] 3 HKLRD 399; HKSAR v Sin Kam-wah (2005) 8 HKCFAR 192",
            "See also HKSAR v Wong Lin-kay [2012] 2 HKLRD 898 which requires misconduct by a public officer in relation to powers and duties exercisable by him for the public benefit.",
            "Section 9(2) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, Cap 201 (POBO) requires proof:",
            "(1) that there exists a principal/agent relationship; (See Ng Siu-chau v HKSAR (2000) 3 HKCFAR 621, HKSAR v Fung Hok-cheung [2008] 3 HKLRD 846 (CA));",
            "(2) that there be an offer to an agent that comes within the definition of those terms in ss.2(2)(a) of the POBO;",
            "(3) of an advantage within the definition in s.2(1) of the POBO;",
            "(4) that the offer of the advantage be as an inducement to, reward for or otherwise on account of;",
            "(5) that agent conducting himself in relation to his principal's affairs or business, by either",
            "(i) doing or forbearing to do an act in relation to his principal's affairs or business; or",

            "The use of confidential information",
            "As we know, on October 27, 2012 the cooling measures for the property market were implemented",
            "From the information gathered by the ICAC, in early June 2012, Mr Lam became aware that he was to be appointed a non-official member of ExCo",
            "At about this time, Mrs Lam engaged a property agent from a Property Agency to sell 4 properties",
            "It was on July 1, 2012 that Mr Lam was appointed to ExCo",
            "It was in late August 2012, that senior members of Government began to discuss implementing concrete measures to regulate the property market",
            "On September 13, 2012, the Financial Secretary gave instructions to introduce such measures",
            "On October 17, 2012, senior Government officials decided that specific cooling measures would be announced on October 26, 2012 to be implemented the following day",
            "On October 25, 2012 a meeting of ExCo was arranged for October 26, 2012 to discuss the proposals",
            "Mr Lam was not in Hong Kong at the time and did not attend the meeting.",
            "On the information available, it is clear that Mr Lam did not use such information in relation to the sale of the properties in question",
            "According to the evidence, they were put on the market in early June 2012, well before any consideration or discussion had taken place at senior levels of Government for the implementation of cooling measures which were subsequently implemented on October 27, 2012.",
            "As stated to the ICAC by the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Housing, the proposal of the Buyer's Stamp Duty was first discussed at a meeting on August 23, 2012 and throughout the formulation of the new measures there was no consultation or discussion with any non-official member of ExCo, including Mr Lam",
            "There does not appear to be any other means by which Mr Lam may have received or come to know about the new measures and in any event could not have done so before late August 2012 when the measures were the subject of high level discussion within Government.",
            "There was simply no evidence to support an offence of misconduct in public office against Mr Lam.",
            "Mr Lam gave two radio interviews on October 31 and November 1, 2012",
            "In the interview on October 31, 2012, he explained that he had decided not to buy or sell any property during his term as an ExCo member in order to avoid any possible conflict of interest but wished to raise funds for meeting exigencies which might arise so he decided to sell some of his properties.",
            "The extra commission",
            "In a statement to the ICAC by the property agent, in early June 2012 when Mrs Lam engaged him to sell the 4 properties, she told him that should the properties be sold at prices higher than the bottom prices she had set, the difference could be given to the agents who had successfully facilitated the transactions as extra commission",
            "The agent however explained to Mrs Lam that such a proposal was not feasible as the Property Agency's policy was to disclose all the commission to both the purchaser and the vendor in the preliminary Sale and Purchase Agreement and in general a purchaser would not agree to the agent collecting an extra commission",
            "Mrs Lam responded that if that was the case, the difference would be donated",
            "It was the only occasion that mention was made by Mrs Lam of extra commission",
            "The agent nevertheless caused an entry to be made into the Property Agency's computer system that if the selling price exceeded the bottom price, the difference will go to the agent.",
            "The Chief Executive Officer of the Property Agency also stated that the amount of commission to be paid by the vendor and the purchaser to their respective agents, whether it be higher or lower than the usual 1% of the purchase price, had to be fully disclosed to the other party and the Property Agency.",
            "Subsequently, only 1 property was sold by the Property Agency in September 2012",
            "The agent who transacted the sale confirmed that no extra commission was paid",
            "Another 1 of the 4 properties was sold to the wife of a friend of Mr Lam in October 2012 without the involvement of the Property Agency or any other property agent",
            "The other 2 properties were not sold.",
            "The agent engaged by Mrs Lam stated to the ICAC that sometime in June 2012, Mr Lam had a telephone conversation with him and told him that he was selling the properties to raise funds as he would be performing public duties on a voluntary basis",
            "There was no mention of an extra commission.",
            "In the radio interview on October 31, 2012, Mr Lam mentioned the extra commission but in another radio interview on November 1, 2012, he added that in discussion between his wife and the agent it was suggested that the difference between the purchase price and the bottom price could be donated.",
            "There was only one discussion about the extra commission and that was between Mrs Lam and the property agent in June 2012",
            "It was somewhat unclear and it is not certain whether it was suggested to be paid to an agent or a charity",
            "It was inputted into the Property Agency's computer as a payment to an agent but there was discussion about it being donated",
            "In any event, the commission payment from the records was 1% in relation to only 1 property that was sold.",
            "The payment of the extra commission was not concealed within the Property Agency",
            "It was inputted into its computer and with respect to each of the 4 properties",
            "It was permissible within the Property Agency for agents to receive a commission higher than 1% of the transaction price but it was required by the Property Agency that it be fully disclosed to the other party to the transaction",
            "It cannot be said to be a secret commission between the property agent and his or her principal, the Property Agency.",
            "Senior Counsel's opinion",
            "Senior Counsel carefully evaluated the evidence and materials and advised that there was no evidence to warrant a charge of misconduct in public office against Mr Lam; there was insufficient evidence to warrant a charge of offering an advantage to an agent against Mr and Mrs Lam and no other offences were revealed.",
            "Senior Counsel concluded that there was no evidence that Mr Lam used confidential information obtained in his capacity as an ExCo member",
            "In relation to the extra commission, he is of the view that the evidence suggested that Mrs Lam was not offering a commission that was secret",
            "He was of the view that the compelling conclusion was that the proposal envisaged the payment to be made with the full knowledge of the principal.",
            "Conclusion",
            "A prosecution can only ever be instituted on the basis of sufficiency of evidence and it should never be started unless there is admissible, substantial and reliable evidence to justify placing a person upon trial",
            "From the provable facts of a case, there must be a reasonable prospect of securing a conviction before a prosecution may be brought",
            "In this case, there simply was not.",
            "The decision taken has been explained so that the public are fully and properly informed about this case which has been the subject of public concern.",

            "2012年7月1日，林先生獲委任為行政會議成員",
            "政府高級官員在2012年8月底開始討論規管樓市的實質措施",

            "無論如何，政府高層在2012年8月底才討論這些事項，因此，他不可能在此之前收到有關措施的資訊或得悉這些措施",

            "林先生在2012年10月31日及11月1日接受電台訪問",
            "他在2012年10月31日的訪問中解釋，為了避免任何可能出現的利益衝突，他決定在擔任行政會議成員期間不進行任何物業買賣，但他希望籌集資金以應付可能出現的緊急情況，於是決定出售部分物業",

            "根據地產經紀向廉署作出的陳述，林太在2012年6月初委託他銷售該4個物業時向他表示，如果該等物業以高於她開出的底價售出，便會把差額給予促成交易的經紀，作為額外佣金",
            "然而，該經紀向林太解釋，這建議並不可行，原因是他所屬的地產代理的政策規定，必須在臨時買賣合約中向買賣雙方披露所有佣金，而買家一般都不會同意讓經紀收取額外佣金",
            "林太的回應是，若然如此，便會捐出差額",
            "這是林太唯一一次提及額外佣金",
            "儘管如此，該名經紀仍在地產代理的電腦系統輸入一項資料，說明假若售價高於底價，差額便歸該名經紀所有",
            "地產代理的行政總裁亦表示，賣家和買家向各自的經紀支付的佣金金額，不論是高於或低於一般的購入價的1%，均須向另一方和地產代理全面披露",
            "其後該地產代理只在2012年9月賣出1個物業",
            "負責該宗買賣交易的經紀確認並無獲支付額外佣金",
            "2012年10月，林先生向朋友的妻子售出該4個物業中的另外一個，當中沒有牽涉該地產代理或任何其他地產經紀",
            "其他兩個物業均沒有售出",
            "林太委託的經紀向廉署表明，在2012年6月某天，林先生在與他的電話對話中表示將會義務擔任公職，因此出售有關物業以籌措資金",
            "其間並無提及額外佣金",
            "在2012年10月31日的電台訪問中，林先生提及額外佣金，但在11月1日的電台訪問中，他補充說，把賣價與底價之間的差價捐出的建議曾在他太太與經紀討論期間提出",
            "有關額外佣金的討論，只在2012年6月林太與物業經紀之間進行了一次",
            "但該討論並沒有清楚或明確指出究竟是建議把額外款項付予經紀或慈善組織",
            "雖然物業代理的電腦將有關款項記錄為交付經紀的款項，但亦有討論提及捐出該筆款項",
            "不管如何，記錄顯示所涉及支付了的佣金，就只有唯一售出的物業的1%佣金",
            "支付額外佣金一事在該地產代理內部並無隱瞞",
            "就所涉及的4項物業的額外佣金一事已輸入了公司電腦",
            "該地產代理容許經紀收取超出成交價1%的款項作為佣金，但規定必須全面披露予交易的另一方",
            "該筆佣金不能視為經紀與其主事人（即地產代理）之間的秘密佣金",
            "資深大律師的意見",
            "資深大律師審慎評估證據及材料後，認為沒有證據支持對林先生控以公職人員行為不當罪，也沒有足夠證據支持對林奮強夫婦控以向代理人提供利益罪，亦沒有發現任何其他罪行",
            "資深大律師的結論是，沒有證據證明林先生使用了以其行政會議成員身分所取得的機密資料",
            "至於額外佣金方面，他認為有關證據顯示，林太並沒有提供秘密佣金",
            "他認為，令人信服的結論是，有關建議是預期在主事人完全知悉的情況下支付款項",
            "結語",

            "除非已有可接納、實質及可靠的證據把某人交付審訊，否則便不應作出檢控",
            "提出檢控前，必須確定案件的可證明事實具有合理機會達至定罪",
            "而本案明顯未達到這項標準",
            "我們已解釋所作的決定，讓市民對這宗備受社會關注的案件有全面和充分的了解",
