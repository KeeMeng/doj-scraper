            "Following is a question by the Hon Wong Ting-kwong and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (February 7):",
            "Question:",
            "It has been reported that early last month, a woman, who was dissatisfied with the court judgment on a certain case, hurled abuses at the magistrate of the case outside the courtroom and was subsequently arrested by the Police for alleged contempt of court. However, there have been people in the past from time to time who were neither arrested nor prosecuted after they had publicly hurled abuses or curses at judges. For example, in October 2016, a former Member of this Council, after having been convicted of a charge of common assault, publicly hurled abuses at the magistrate of the case by calling him a \"dog judge\" by name, and his supporters even uttered the curse that \"the whole family of the magistrate would go to hell\". Some members of the public have queried the inconsistent standards on law enforcement adopted by the authorities in respect of acts of contempt of court. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the respective numbers of persons arrested and prosecuted in the past three years for alleged contempt of court, with a breakdown by the type of acts involved in such cases (e.g. obstructing or refusing the execution of court rulings or orders, acting in a disorderly manner before a court and insulting a judge either inside or outside a courtroom);",
            "(2) of the respective criteria adopted by the authorities for determining whether a person who has allegedly committed an act of contempt of court (especially hurling abuses at a judge) should be arrested and prosecuted; whether the considerations involved include the political stance and background of the person involved in the case, the race and nationality of the judge being insulted, and the stance expressed by legal professionals and bodies on the act involved in the case; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and",
            "(3) whether the authorities will review those cases that occurred in the past three years in which abuses and curses were publicly hurled at judges and the persons involved were neither arrested nor prosecuted, so as to respond to the queries raised by members of the public regarding the authorities' inconsistent standards on law enforcement; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Judicial independence is an essential element of the rule of law. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government respects the freedom of speech of individuals. Members of the public have the right to express their views on court decisions and related matters within the boundary permitted by the law. Rational discussions can also promote awareness of the rule of law. However, as pointed out by the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, Mr Geoffrey Ma Tao-li, at this year's Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year, \"… any comments that may be made about the work of the Judiciary, whether seemingly positive or negative, should be done on an informed basis.\" I should stress that personal attacks, insults and even threats against judges and judicial officers would severely undermine the authority of the courts and damage public confidence in the judicial system.",
            "I would also like to reiterate that, effective enforcement of court orders and the law is especially important for upholding the rule of law. Interim injunctions are orders made by the court, and should be observed notwithstanding that they are interim in nature. Breaching or omitting to comply with interim injunctions may also very likely amount to contempt of court. In a judgment concerning an interim injunction, the court has observed that even if the defendants are of the view that a court order is wrongly granted, instead of simply disobeying it, they should first comply with it and then seek to challenge that order pursuant to the judicial process.",
            "As I stated at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year, it is my duty as the Secretary for Justice to ensure that the independence of our Judiciary, as enshrined in the Basic Law, is respected and judges are not arbitrarily attacked or criticised.",
            "As always, the Department of Justice (DoJ) is very concerned about any conduct that may constitute a contempt of court, and will not hesitate to take suitable follow-up measures where appropriate and necessary.",
            "Under common law, criminal contempt of court means conduct calculated to interfere with the due administration of justice, and there must be a real risk that the due administration of justice would be undermined by the relevant conduct. \"Contempt of court\" covers a wide range of conducts. Examples of conducts that may constitute criminal contempt as mentioned above are conducts disrupting court hearing or insulting judicial officers; refusing to be sworn to give evidence when called as a witness in the face of the court; scandalising the court by published words outside the court; publication of any report which prejudices the fair trial of an on-going proceeding; and obstructing the execution of court orders, etc. To take the contempt of scandalising the court as illustration, past cases show that contemnors can be sentenced to substantial fines and imprisonment.",
            "Generally speaking, once any conduct that may constitute a contempt of court has come to its knowledge or been referred by the Judiciary, the DoJ will refer the case to law enforcement agencies (LEAs) for investigation. If members of the public witness or note any conduct which in their view may constitute a contempt of court, they can certainly make a report and provide information to the LEAs as well.",
            "It is worth mentioning that in certain circumstances, the courts are empowered by legal provisions to summarily punish those who commit a contempt of court, for example, under section 99 of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap 227) and section 20 of the District Court Ordinance (Cap 336). These statutory provisions cover insulting behaviours in the face of a magistrate or a judge. Depending on the applicable provisions, offenders are liable to the maximum penalty of a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months to two years.",
            "Besides, contempt of court situations may also arise in civil litigation. Civil contempt of court generally refers to the breach or omission to comply with a court order or an undertaking given to the court by a party to the civil proceedings. In cases of civil contempt, it is generally for a party to the proceedings to apply to the court for a committal order against the other party who is alleged to be in breach of the court order. The applying party needs to prove to the court that the other party has breached or omitted to comply with the relevant court order or undertaking given to the court. Depending on the severity of the conduct in contempt of court, the types of punishment may include imprisonment, suspended committal order or fines.",
            "The consolidated response of the DoJ to the three questions raised by the Hon Wong Ting-kwong concerning arrests and prosecutions for suspected contempt of court is as follows:",
            "Contempt of court covers a wide range of conducts and offences, and government LEAs and the DoJ have not kept a set of figures covering all relevant cases. Hence, the Government is unable to provide relevant figures in respect of cases involving alleged contempt of court.",
            "If the Police have reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has committed contempt of court, the Police will commence investigation. The Police Force is a professional LEA. It has always been acting in accordance with the law, and handling and investigating every case in a fair and just manner. In considering whether to take any arrest action in an individual case, the Police must consider whether the person concerned is suspected to have contravened the law, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the evidence available. The political stance or background of the person concerned is not a relevant consideration of the Police in taking law enforcement actions.",
            "If necessary, the Police will seek legal advice from the DoJ. The DoJ has to decide whether to bring prosecution in a case in accordance with the Prosecution Code: the first consideration is whether the evidence is sufficient to justify a prosecution, that is, whether the admissible and reliable evidence demonstrates a reasonable prospect of conviction; if there is sufficient evidence to prosecute, further consideration is given as to whether the public interest requires a prosecution to proceed.",
            "While contempt of court proceedings (which proceed according to procedures of civil proceedings) are different from general criminal proceedings, the guiding principles of arrest and prosecution as mentioned above are applicable to cases that may constitute contempt of court.",
            "Moreover, for cases in respect of which decisions have been made not to prosecute, provided there are justifiable circumstances (for example, where unanticipated significant evidence becomes available at a later time), the DoJ will review the previous decisions not to prosecute.",
            "I must emphasise that officers of the LEAs and the DoJ act fairly by adhering to the above guiding principles, and will not, and should not, be influenced by irrelevant factors such as political stance and background, race and nationality of the person(s) concerned, or the opinions of the public or professional bodies. Most importantly, they will not apply double standards.",
            "Thank you. President.",

            "以下是今日（二月七日）在立法會會議上黃定光議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "據報，上月初，有一名不滿某案件判決的女子在法庭外辱罵該案的裁判官，其後被警方以涉嫌藐視法庭拘捕。然而，過去不時有人公開辱罵或詛咒法官後未有被拘捕或檢控。例如，二○一六年十月，本會一名前議員被裁定普通襲擊罪罪成後，公開具名辱罵該案的裁判官為「狗官」，而其支持者更詛咒該法官「死全家」。有市民質疑，當局就藐視法庭行為的執法標準不一致。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）過去三年，因涉嫌藐視法庭而被拘捕及檢控的人數分別為何，並按涉案行為的類別（例如阻撓或拒絕執行法庭裁決或命令、擾亂法庭秩序及在法庭內或外辱罵法官）列出分項數字；",
            "（二）當局分別以何準則決定是否拘捕及檢控涉嫌曾作出藐視法庭（特別是辱罵法官）行為的人士；當中的考慮因素是否包括涉案人的政治立場及背景、被辱罵法官的種族及國籍，以及法律專業人士及團體就涉案行為表達的立場；若是，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及",
            "（三）當局會否覆檢過去三年內發生、對涉案人未作出拘捕或檢控的公開辱罵及詛咒法官案件，以回應市民對當局執法標準不一致的質疑；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "司法獨立是法治的重要元素。香港特區政府尊重個人的言論自由，社會人士有權在法律容許的範圍內就法院的裁決或相關事項發表意見，理性的討論亦可以提高法治意識。然而，正如終審法院首席法官馬道立在本年法律年度開啟典禮上指出，「針對司法機構工作的評論，不論表面看來是褒是貶，都應當在有理可據的基礎上作出。」我強調，對法官及司法人員作出人身攻擊及辱駡，甚至是向他們作出威嚇，均會嚴重損害法院的權威及打擊公眾對司法制度的信心。",
            "我重申，法庭命令及法律要有效地執行，對維護法治尤為重要。臨時強制令是法庭作出的命令，雖然是臨時性質亦必須遵守。違反或忽略遵守臨時強制令亦極有可能構成藐視法庭。法院在處理臨時禁制令的判決中曾指出，即使被告人認為法庭命令有錯，也不應違抗，而是應先遵守命令，再依循司法程序提出反駁理據。",
            "我在法律年度開啟典禮上説明，身為律政司司長，我有責任確保《基本法》明訂的司法獨立受到尊重，法官不會遭任意攻擊或批評。",
            "一如過往，律政司對任何可能構成藐視法庭的行為，都十分關注，在合適和有需要時，會毫不猶豫採取適當的跟進措施。",
            "普通法所指的刑事藐視法庭，是指蓄意干擾司法工作妥善執行的行為，而相關行為有確實風險會對司法工作的妥善執行構成干擾。藐視法庭涵蓋多種不同的行為。在法庭上作出擾亂聆訊或侮辱司法人員的行為、被法庭傳召為證人的人拒絕宣誓作供、在法庭外發布誹謗法院的言論、在審訊當中發布影響公平審訊的報道、妨礙執行法院命令等等，均可能構成以上所指的刑事藐視法庭。以誹謗法院的藐視法庭為例，過往有案件顯示藐視法庭者可被判處巨額罰款及監禁。",
            "一般而言，如律政司獲悉可能構成藐視法庭的行為或由司法機構轉介，會將個案轉介執法機構調查。若公眾人士目擊或注意到他們認為可能構成藐視法庭的行為，當然亦可向執法機構舉報及提供資料。",
            "值得一提的是，在某些情況下，法律條文亦賦予法院權力循簡易程序懲處藐視法庭的人，例如是《裁判官條例》（第227章）第99條及《區域法院條例》（第336章）第20條，這些條文涵蓋在裁判官或法官席前作出具侮辱性的行為，干犯者最高可被判處10,000元罰款及六個月至兩年監禁（視乎適用的條文而言）。",
            "此外，在民事訴訟中也可出現藐視法庭的情況。民事藐視法庭一般而言是指民事訴訟一方違反或忽略服從法庭的命令，或對法庭作出的承諾。民事藐視法庭一般由訴訟一方向法庭申請提出將涉嫌違反法庭命令的另一方交付羈押，提出申請的一方需要向法庭證明另一方違反或忽略服從有關法庭命令或對法庭作出的承諾。藐視法庭的行為視乎嚴重程度，處罰方法可以包括入獄、緩刑或罰款。",
            "就黃定光議員有關涉嫌藐視法庭行為拘捕及檢控的三個問題，律政司綜合回覆如下：",
            "涉及藐視法庭行為的種類和罪行眾多，政府執法部門及律政司未有備存一套涵蓋所有相關個案的數字。因此，政府未能提供涉嫌藐視法庭案件的相關數字。",
            "如警方有合理懷疑有人涉嫌藐視法庭，會展開調查。警方是專業的執法部門，一向依法辦事，並一直以公平公正的態度去處理和調查每一宗案件。就每一宗案件考慮是否作出拘捕時，警方必須根據案件的情況和所得的證據考慮涉案人士是否有涉嫌違法。有關人士的政治立場或背景，不是警方執法時的考慮因素。",
            "若有需要，警方會向律政司尋求法律意見。律政司須按照《檢控守則》行事，決定是否進行檢控：首先須考慮是否有充分證據進行檢控，即根據可接納和可靠的證據，是否有合理機會達致定罪；如有充分證據進行檢控，則須進一步考慮作出檢控是否符合公眾利益。",
            "雖然懲處藐視法庭的法律程序與一般的刑事訴訟程序有別（有關案件會根據民事訴訟程序進行），但以上有關拘捕和檢控的基本原則均適用於可能構成藐視法庭的個案。",
            "再者，就已決定不進行檢控的案件，如有充分理由（例如獲得案中原先未有預期可獲得的重要證據），則律政司亦會覆檢先前不進行檢控的決定。",
            "我必須強調，執法人員和律政司是按上述的基本原則公正地行事，不會亦不得受涉案人士的政治立場和背景、種族和國籍、社會大眾或專業團體的輿論等等與案件無關的因素所影響，更不會持雙重標準。",
            "多謝主席。",

            "一如過往，律政司對任何可能構成藐視法庭的行為，都十分關注，在合適和有需要時，會毫不猶豫採取適當的跟進措施",
            "普通法所指的刑事藐視法庭，是指蓄意干擾司法工作妥善執行的行為，而相關行為有確實風險會對司法工作的妥善執行構成干擾",
            "藐視法庭涵蓋多種不同的行為",
            "在法庭上作出擾亂聆訊或侮辱司法人員的行為、被法庭傳召為證人的人拒絕宣誓作供、在法庭外發布誹謗法院的言論、在審訊當中發布影響公平審訊的報道、妨礙執行法院命令等等，均可能構成以上所指的刑事藐視法庭",
            "以誹謗法院的藐視法庭為例，過往有案件顯示藐視法庭者可被判處巨額罰款及監禁",
            "一般而言，如律政司獲悉可能構成藐視法庭的行為或由司法機構轉介，會將個案轉介執法機構調查",
            "若公眾人士目擊或注意到他們認為可能構成藐視法庭的行為，當然亦可向執法機構舉報及提供資料",
            "值得一提的是，在某些情況下，法律條文亦賦予法院權力循簡易程序懲處藐視法庭的人，例如是《裁判官條例》（第227章）第99條及《區域法院條例》（第336章）第20條，這些條文涵蓋在裁判官或法官席前作出具侮辱性的行為，干犯者最高可被判處10,000元罰款及六個月至兩年監禁（視乎適用的條文而言）",
            "此外，在民事訴訟中也可出現藐視法庭的情況",
            "民事藐視法庭一般而言是指民事訴訟一方違反或忽略服從法庭的命令，或對法庭作出的承諾",
            "民事藐視法庭一般由訴訟一方向法庭申請提出將涉嫌違反法庭命令的另一方交付羈押，提出申請的一方需要向法庭證明另一方違反或忽略服從有關法庭命令或對法庭作出的承諾",
            "藐視法庭的行為視乎嚴重程度，處罰方法可以包括入獄、緩刑或罰款",
            "就黃定光議員有關涉嫌藐視法庭行為拘捕及檢控的三個問題，律政司綜合回覆如下：",
            "涉及藐視法庭行為的種類和罪行眾多，政府執法部門及律政司未有備存一套涵蓋所有相關個案的數字",
            "因此，政府未能提供涉嫌藐視法庭案件的相關數字",
            "如警方有合理懷疑有人涉嫌藐視法庭，會展開調查",
            "警方是專業的執法部門，一向依法辦事，並一直以公平公正的態度去處理和調查每一宗案件",
            "就每一宗案件考慮是否作出拘捕時，警方必須根據案件的情況和所得的證據考慮涉案人士是否有涉嫌違法",
            "有關人士的政治立場或背景，不是警方執法時的考慮因素",
            "若有需要，警方會向律政司尋求法律意見",
            "律政司須按照《檢控守則》行事，決定是否進行檢控：首先須考慮是否有充分證據進行檢控，即根據可接納和可靠的證據，是否有合理機會達致定罪；如有充分證據進行檢控，則須進一步考慮作出檢控是否符合公眾利益",
            "雖然懲處藐視法庭的法律程序與一般的刑事訴訟程序有別（有關案件會根據民事訴訟程序進行），但以上有關拘捕和檢控的基本原則均適用於可能構成藐視法庭的個案",
            "再者，就已決定不進行檢控的案件，如有充分理由（例如獲得案中原先未有預期可獲得的重要證據），則律政司亦會覆檢先前不進行檢控的決定",
            "我必須強調，執法人員和律政司是按上述的基本原則公正地行事，不會亦不得受涉案人士的政治立場和背景、種族和國籍、社會大眾或專業團體的輿論等等與案件無關的因素所影響，更不會持雙重標準",
            "多謝主席",
