            "The Chief Executive, Mr C Y Leung, held a press conference today (November 7) with the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mrs Carrie Lam; the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC; and the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Raymond Tam. Following is the transcript of remarks at the press conference:",
            "Chief Executive: Certain elected members of the current-term Legislative Council (LegCo), including Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching, deliberately violated the oath-taking procedure and content requirements of the oath. They even insulted the Country and the Chinese people in their words and deeds in the oath-taking, as well as advocated \"Hong Kong independence\". Their conduct has caused widespread indignation in Hong Kong and across the Country. The SAR Government considers that their conduct seriously undermines the rule of law and deals a heavy blow to \"one country, two systems\".",
            "On the 18th of last month, the SAR Government commenced legal proceedings in the court, requesting the court to rule that Leung and Yau have failed to fulfill the legal requirements and should be disqualified as LegCo members in accordance with Article 104 of the Basic Law, the Oaths and Declarations Ordinance, as well as previous court rulings of related cases.",
            "This morning at its meeting in Beijing, in accordance with the requirements of Article 67(4) of the Constitution and Article 158(1) of the Basic Law, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) issued its Interpretation (Interpretation) and clear explanations concerning oath-taking by public officers specified in Article 104 of the Basic Law, including LegCo members, when assuming office.",
            "It is an important part of the constitutional and legal systems of HKSAR for the NPCSC to exercise its power conferred by the Constitution and the Basic Law to interpret provisions of the Basic Law. The Interpretation is intended to ensure that public officers specified in Article 104 of the Basic Law, when assuming office and taking oath in accordance with law, must read out the oath as prescribed in the law, including \"to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\", in an accurate, complete and solemn manner.",
            "The Interpretation has clarified that any oath taken in a manner that is not sincere or solemn is considered a \"decline\" to take an oath, and that the oath taken is rendered invalid. As such, the person taking the oath is regarded as having forthwith lost his/her qualification for the corresponding public office and they therefore cannot assume such public office, nor exercise his/her duties or enjoy the corresponding benefits of the office.",
            "The Interpretation clearly explains the meaning of Article 104 of the Basic Law and the consequences of contravening the provision. The Interpretation also explains clearly the requirements for oath-taking by specified public officers.",
            "All specified public officers, including LegCo members, when taking oath in assuming office, must pledge in the oath in a sincere and solemn manner to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. This is both to comply with the legal and constitutional requirements and a prerequisite for standing for election or assuming office. Any words or deeds that deliberately contravene the above requirements, defy the prescribed oath-taking procedure, or even use the opportunity to insult the Country and the Chinese people, and advocate secession must be stopped in accordance with the law. I and the SAR Government support the Interpretation passed by the NPCSC today. As the Chief Executive of the SAR, I have the duty to implement the Basic Law in accordance with Article 48 of the Basic Law. I and the SAR Government will implement the Interpretation fully.",
            "Hong Kong is an inalienable part of the Country. The Hong Kong people have the duty to uphold national unity, territorial integrity and security, as well as the dignity and interests of the Chinese people. I am certain the Hong Kong community will agree that every LegCo member has the duty to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, and to fully implement the constitutional arrangements and legal requirements under \"one country, two systems\".",

            "行政長官：各位，本屆立法會有當選議員，包括梁頌恆和游蕙禎，在就職宣誓過程中，故意違反宣誓的程序和誓詞的規定，甚至作出侮辱國家和民族的言行，宣揚「港獨」主張，因而在香港以至全國引起了極大的憤慨。特區政府認為，他們的行為嚴重衝擊法治，破壞「一國兩制」，造成極大的衝擊和極壞的影響。",
            "特區政府已於上月十八日根據《基本法》第一百零四條、《宣誓及聲明條例》及法院先前就相關案例所作的判決，啟動司法程序，要求法院裁決梁、游二人未能符合法定要求，並應被取消議員資格。",
            "今日早上，全國人大常委會在北京的會議上，根據憲法第六十七條第四項及《基本法》第一百五十八條第一款的規定，就《基本法》第一百零四條所指定的公職人員，包括立法會議員的就職宣誓，作出清晰的解釋（下稱《解釋》）和說明。",
            "全國人大常委會根據憲法和《基本法》賦予的權力對《基本法》條文進行解釋，是香港特區憲制和法律制度的重要部分。全國人大常委會今次所作的解釋，旨在確保《基本法》第一百零四條中所列明的公職人員就職時依法宣誓，必須準確、完整、莊重地宣讀包括 「擁護中華人民共和國香港特別行政區基本法，效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區」內容的法定誓詞。全國人大常委會的《解釋》進一步釐清，任何以不真誠、不莊重方式進行的宣誓，均屬「拒絕」宣誓，所作的宣誓因而無效；宣誓人亦即喪失相應的公職資格，並且不得就任該公職，也不得行使其職權和享受相應的待遇。",
            "上述《解釋》清楚說明《基本法》第一百零四條的含意和違反該條文的後果，亦明確了指定公職人員的宣誓要求。",
            "公職人員，包括立法會議員，依法宣誓就職，必須在宣誓中真誠莊嚴地承諾擁護中華人民共和國香港特別行政區《基本法》和效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區，這是符合法律和憲制性要求的必要之舉，也是參選或出任該條所列公職的法定要求和條件。特區政府和社會大眾對任何刻意違反上述規定、蔑視依法宣誓程序，甚或借機侮辱國家民族、鼓吹分裂國家和主權的行為，都必須遏止，嚴正依法處理。我和特區政府對全國人大常委會今日通過的《解釋》，表示支持，我作為特區的首長，有責任根據《基本法》第四十八條執行《基本法》，我和特區政府將全面切實執行。",
            "香港是國家不可分離的部分，全體香港市民有責任維護國家的統一、領土完整和安全，以及民族的尊嚴和利益。我深信社會大眾都會認同，每一位特區立法機關的議員，都有責任擁護中華人民共和國香港特別行政區《基本法》，效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區，並且貫徹執行「一國兩制」下的憲制安排和規定。",
