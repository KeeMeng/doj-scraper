            "The Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, yesterday (October 14, London time) appealed to the participants of the London Law Expo 2014 to choose Hong Kong as the venue for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "Mr Yuen was delivering a speech at the main panel session of the London Law Expo 2014 yesterday morning. He said that capitalising on its robust legal system and modern legal infrastructure, Hong Kong has been positioning itself as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region for a considerable period of time.",
            "He highlighted that there are six reasons why Hong Kong should be considered as an ideal venue for international legal and dispute resolution services in the region. They are Hong Kong's geographic location and the trend of global economic development; Hong Kong's common law legal system; the rule of law and judicial independence; the presence of a strong team of legal and dispute resolution practitioners; strong Government support; and Hong Kong's modern and robust infrastructure, which supports the effective provision of international legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "In respect of queries which have recently been raised as to the state of the rule of law or judicial independence in Hong Kong, Mr Yuen pointed out, \"However, all those assertions and queries which sought to suggest that the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong are being eroded are no more than mistaken perception. Not only is there no evidence to support such bare assertions, the objective circumstances point to the opposite direction, i.e. the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong are as good as before.\"",
            "Apart from attending the Expo, Mr Yuen also delivered a speech at a luncheon organised by the Hong Kong Association to explain the legal and constitutional regime relating to the election of the Chief Executive (CE) by universal suffrage, as stipulated in Article 45 of the Basic Law, and the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Issues Relating to the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by Universal Suffrage and on the Method for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the Year 2016 on August 31, 2014.",
            "He said that issues concerning constitutional development have always been controversial. It is exactly for this reason that it is necessary to be rational and pragmatic, so that the people of Hong Kong can reach a consensus and move forward.",
            "\"Irrespective of one's view on the formation and composition of the nominating committee, the election of CE by 'one man, one vote' will necessarily be a step forward, and will certainly be a system more democratic than the current system of election of CE by the Election Committee.",
            "\"There is no reason to allow perfection to be the enemy of the good, and there is no reason not to pursue universal suffrage simply because the community remains to have divergent views on what is the best system,\" Mr Yuen said.",
            "Mr Yuen yesterday also met with the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Mr Chris Grayling, exchanging views on matters of common interest including the latest developments of legal and dispute resolution services in Hong Kong and the UK.",

            "袁國強在二○一四年倫敦法律博覽會的專題討論會議上致辭時說，香港憑藉健全的法律制度和現代法律基建，一直定位為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心。",
            "他指出，有六個因素令香港應被考慮作為理想的國際法律和解決爭議服務地點。這些因素分別為︰香港的地理位置及全球經濟發展趨勢、香港的普通法法制、法治和司法獨立、強大的法律和解決爭議執業者團隊、政府的強力支援、以及香港的現代化和健全基建，使其有效提供國際法律和解決爭議服務。",
            "就近期有人質疑香港的法治或司法獨立狀況，袁國強指出：「然而，所有這些指香港的法治和司法獨立正被侵蝕的斷言和質疑，均是錯誤的。這些斷言並沒有證據支持，客觀情況更是恰恰相反，香港的法治和司法獨立狀況跟以往一樣良好。」",
            "除出席博覽會外，袁國強亦在一個由香港工商協會主辦的午餐會上致辭，解釋根據《基本法》第四十五條有關行政長官由普選產生的法律和憲法制度，以及全國人民代表大會常務委員會於八月三十一日作出《關於香港特別行政區行政長官普選問題和2016年立法會產生辦法的決定》。",
            "他說有關政制發展的議題一向具爭議性，正因如此，必須理性務實，以使香港市民能達致共識和向前邁進。",
            "袁國強說：「不論個別人士就提名委員會組成的看法如何，行政長官由『一人一票』選出必然是向前邁進的一步，亦肯定是個較現時由選舉委員會選出行政長官更為民主的制度。」",
            "「沒有理由為追求完美而窒礙發展，亦沒有理由因社會仍對如何才是最好的制度意見分歧而不追求普選。」",
            "袁國強昨日亦與司法大臣兼大法官紀嘉林會面，就雙方關注有關香港和英國法律和解決爭議服務最新發展事宜交換意見。",
