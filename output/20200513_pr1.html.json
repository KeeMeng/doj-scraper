            "In accordance with the Government's commitment, the proposed increase reflects the outcome of the biennial review of the bereavement sum by making reference to the Consumer Price Index (A) (CPI(A)). The increased sum will reflect the cumulative impact of inflation experienced over the period from March 2018 to March 2020.",

It allows an action for damages to be brought against a person for the benefit of the dependants of the deceased in respect of that person's wrongful act, neglect or default which has caused the death of the deceased. An action under the Ordinance may include a claim for damages for bereavement in the sum as prescribed in section 4(3). Section 4(5) of the Ordinance provides that the LegCo may by resolution vary the sum.",
