            "Following is a question by the Hon James To and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (December 12):",
            "Question:",
            "At its meeting held on July 20, 2015, the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services of this Council discussed the administration of the estate of the late Ms Nina Kung. In addition, the Government disclosed early this year that it had drawn up in May 2017 the latest draft of the administration scheme on using the estate for charitable purposes (the Scheme) and was awaiting a response from the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the Foundation). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) given that a government representative undertook at the aforesaid meeting to provide the Panel with the information on the arrangements for the interim administration of the estate and a breakdown of its properties insofar as it was allowed under the law, of the reasons why the Government has not yet provided such information, and whether it will do so immediately;",
            "(2) whether it knows the following information on the estate: (i) the current total value, (ii) the respective total amounts of fees collected so far by the interim administrators of the estate, the managers recruited from outside and other persons involved in the administration of the estate (please specify), and (iii) the amounts of money used for charitable purposes in each of the past three years; and",
            "(3) whether the discussions conducted between the Government and the Foundation on the Scheme have been concluded;",
            "(i) if not, whether the Government has set a deadline; at what time the latest the Government will seek the Court's directions to ensure that the Scheme will be confirmed and implemented expeditiously; whether it will consider taking measures to enhance the administration of the estate (e.g. appointing government officials to sit on the Board of Governors of the Foundation); and",
            "(ii) if so, whether the Government has submitted the Scheme to the Court?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "A reply to the questions raised by the Hon James To in relation to the matters concerning the administration of the Estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang is as follows.",
            "(1) and (2) At the meeting of the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services on July 20, 2015, Members asked the Department of Justice (DoJ) to provide information on (a) arrangements approved by the Court concerning the interim administration of the Estate; (b) background, qualification and remuneration of each member of the Executive Committee (Exco) of the Chinachem Group; and (c) a list of the properties of the Estate.",
            "The Secretary for Justice had explained in detail the arrangements approved by the Court concerning the interim administration of the Estate in her reply to the questions raised by the Hon Paul Tse at the meeting of the Legislative Council on January 31 early this year. Since December 10, 2007, the Estate has, pursuant to a Court order, been administered on an interim basis by independent interim administrators appointed with the sanction of the Court of First Instance. The current interim administrators are Mr Christopher Chan, Mr Jong Yat-kit and Mr Wong Tak-wai of PricewaterhouseCoopers.",
            "Being \"officers of the Court\", the interim administrators owe a duty to the Court on matters relating to the interim administration of the Estate. The Court may also give directions to the interim administrators if and when necessary. The work of the interim administrators will continue to be monitored by the Court, including the consideration of the periodical reports and other relevant materials provided by them.",
            "DoJ has, at all times, been paying close attention to the administration of the Estate and has been in frequent contact with the interim administrators, including considering the periodical reports provided by the interim administrators, approaching the interim administrators to further understand matters relating to the interim administration of the Estate, requesting the interim administrators to take follow-up actions and provide reports as the circumstances require, assisting the Court in legal proceedings taken out by the interim administrators, and seeking directions from the Court in the course of interim administration as may be required.",
            "DoJ will continue to closely monitor the interim administrators' work in managing and preserving the Estate and the litigation involving the Chinachem Group and the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the Foundation), and take such follow-up actions as may be appropriate.",
            "DoJ has sought updates on the Estate from the parties concerned. With their consent, information which can be disclosed is set out below:",
            "The core assets of the Estate comprise the assets of the companies in the Chinachem Group with a net asset value of about HK$137 billion as at August 31, 2018 based on the relevant unaudited combined management accounts. According to the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal dated May 18, 2015, the Chinachem Group was valued in 2012 at over HK$82 billion.",
            "Since the Chinachem Group is not a listed company, after having sought the views from the concerned parties, apart from the net asset value disclosed above, it would not be appropriate for us to disclose the breakdown of its properties which contain sensitive and confidential information.",
            "The Chinachem Group is managed by its Exco and its current members are as follows (set out in the alphabetical order of the surnames in English (save for the interim administrators)):",
            "(1) Mr Chan Kam-por (Group's Chief Financial Officer);",
            "(2) Mr Donald Choi (Group's Chief Executive Officer);",
            "(3) Dr Kung Yan-sum (Chairman of Exco meetings);",
            "(4) Mr Derek Leung (Chief Treasury Officer, Head of Lands/Valuation of the Group);",
            "(5) Ms Liu Yuan-chun (Group's Director of Human Resources);",
            "(6) Mr Ng Shung-mo (Group's Head of Sales);",
            "(7) Mr Wong Hung-han (Deputy Head of Leasing and Chief Operating Officer of the Group);",
            "(8) Mr Osborn Edward (Representative of the interim administrators);",
            "(9) Mr Christopher Chan (one of the interim administrators); and",
            "(10) Mr Jong Yat-kit (one of the interim administrators).",
            "During the period from 2015 to 2018 (up till November 30, 2018), the Chinachem Group has in each year made donations for charity purpose to different charitable organisations and other entities in the amounts of about HK$9.7 million, HK$5 million, HK$4 million and HK$3 million respectively, the aggregate sum being over HK$22 million.",
            "As for the fees of the independent interim administrators, they have been prescribed by the Court in the Appointment Order and are subject to the Court's scrutiny. As the relevant order was made at a hearing not open to public, it is inappropriate for DoJ to provide further details of such information in the absence of any order of the Court directing disclosure.",
            "DoJ and the Foundation have also been monitoring the fees charged by the interim administrators. Should DoJ and the Foundation consider the amount to be too high or unreasonable, an application may be made to the Court for taxation of the fees, in order to ensure that the interim administrators' fees remain reasonable.",
            "(3) By its judgment of May 18, 2015 concerning the Will of the late Mrs Nina Wang, the Court of Final Appeal held that the Foundation is to hold the Estate as a trustee rather than receiving it as an unconditional absolute gift. As the work in implementing the Will is still ongoing, the said judgment does not affect the current independent interim administrators' discharge of the abovementioned duties to manage and preserve the Estate pursuant to the Court's appointment until any further Court order. Therefore, at this stage the Estate has not been vested on the Foundation. DoJ will continue to pay close attention to the financial condition of the Foundation.",
            "Since the handing down of the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal on May 18, 2015 (CFA Judgment), DoJ and the Foundation have had meetings and have been in communications on the contents of the proposed Scheme. In order to facilitate constructive and frank discussions, the parties have agreed that the details of such communications should be kept in confidence in the meantime. Meetings have been held to discuss specific areas of the proposed Scheme, including the establishment of the \"supervisory\" managing organisation, and that a draft Scheme has been prepared taking into account the clauses of the 2002 Will and the relevant guidance contained in the CFA Judgment.",
            "DoJ and the Foundation are actively discussing the content of the draft Scheme with a view to reaching consensus as soon as practicable. We anticipate that DoJ may make an application to the Court for directions concerning the Scheme by the first quarter of 2019, if necessary.",
            "In addition, DoJ will continue to liaise with the interim administrators and request relevant information when appropriate on the detailed arrangements for the implementation of the Will.",

            "本會司法及法律事務委員會於二○一五年七月二十日的會議上，討論已故龔如心女士的遺產管理事宜。此外，政府於今年初披露，已於二○一七年五月備妥該筆遺產用作慈善用途的管理計劃（管理計劃）的最新草擬本，並正等待華懋慈善基金（基金）作出回應。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）鑑於政府代表於上述會議中答允，在法律容許的情況下，向該事務委員會提供遺產的臨時管理安排及財產分項資料，政府為何仍未提供該等資料，以及可否立刻提供；",
            "（二）是否知悉，該筆遺產的下列資料：（i）現時總值、（ii）臨時遺產管理人、外聘經理及其他涉及管理遺產人士（請列明）分別至今已收取的費用總額，以及（iii）過去三年每年用於慈善用途的款額；及",
            "（三）政府與基金就管理計劃進行的磋商是否已完成；（i）若否，政府有否設定限期；政府最遲會於何時向法庭尋求指示，以確保盡快確定及執行管理計劃；會否考慮採取措施加強管理該筆遺產（例如委任政府官員加入基金的董事會）；（ii）若是，政府是否已向法庭提交管理計劃？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "就涂謹申議員有關已故龔如心女士的遺產管理等事宜的提問，律政司回覆如下：",
            "（一）及（二）立法會司法及法律事務委員會委員於二○一五年七月二十日舉行的會議中要求律政司提供資料，闡述（甲）法庭就該筆遺產批准的臨時管理安排，（乙）華懋集團管治委員會內各成員的背景、資歷及薪酬，以及（丙）該筆遺產下的財產的分項資料。",
            "律政司司長於本年一月三十一日在立法會會議上回應謝偉俊議員提問的答覆中，已詳細解釋法庭就該筆遺產批准的臨時管理安排。自二○○七年十二月十日起，該筆遺產按照法庭所頒的命令，由原訟法庭委任的獨立臨時遺產管理人作臨時管理。現時的臨時遺產管理人由羅兵咸永道會計師事務所的陳偉棠、庄日杰及黃德偉出任。",
            "作為「法院人員」（officers of the Court），臨時遺產管理人須就遺產管理事宜向法庭負責，而法庭亦有權在有需要時向臨時遺產管理人頒布指令。臨時遺產管理人的工作一直受法庭監管，包括審閱其定期提交的報告和其他相關資料。",
            "律政司一直以來也有密切關注該筆遺產的管理狀況及與臨時遺產管理人保持緊密聯繫，包括審閱臨時遺產管理人的定期報告、進一步向臨時遺產管理人了解相關事宜、按情況及需要要求臨時遺產管理人作出跟進和匯報、協助法庭處理臨時遺產管理人在過程中提出的法律程序，以及在有需要時就該筆遺產的臨時遺產管理事宜向法庭尋求指示。",
            "律政司會繼續密切關注臨時遺產管理人就該筆遺產的管理和保存的工作，以及牽涉華懋集團及基金的法律訴訟，並在有需要時作出適當的跟進。",
            "就該筆遺產的資料，律政司已向有關人士索取更新資料。經取得他們的同意，現將可以公開的資料載列如下:",
            "該筆遺產的核心資產包括華懋集團內各公司的資產。按有關未經審核的合計管理報表，截至二○一八年八月三十一日為止，華懋集團的資產淨值約為港幣一千三百七十億元。根據終審法院二○一五年五月十八日頒下的判決，華懋集團於二○一二年的資產值約超過港幣八百二十億元。",
            "由於華懋集團不是上市公司，在徵詢了有關人士的意見後，除上述資產淨值外，律政司不便透露財產分項的詳情，因當中涉及敏感及機密資料。",
            "華懋集團由管治委員會監督，現任成員如下（按英文姓氏排序（臨時遺產管理人除外））:",
            "（一）陳鑑波（集團財務總監）；",
            "（二）蔡宏興（集團行政總裁）；",
            "（三）龔仁心醫生（集團管治委員會會議主席）；",
            "（四）梁煒才（集團司庫及土地評估部主管）；",
            "（五）劉元春（集團人力資源部主管）；",

            "（九）陳偉棠（其中一位臨時遺產管理人）；及",
            "（十）庄日杰（其中一位臨時遺產管理人）。",
            "在二○一五至二○一八年期間（截至二○一八年十一月三十日為止），華懋集團每年均向不同的慈善機構及其他單位捐款作慈善用途，總額超過港幣二千二百萬元。在上述期間，每年捐出總額分別為約港幣九百七十萬元、港幣五百萬元、港幣四百萬元及港幣三百萬元。",
            "至於有關獨立臨時遺產管理人收取的費用，在法庭的委任命令經已有所規定，並受法庭的監督。由於有關命令是在非公開的聆訊作出，在法庭沒有頒令披露的情況下，我們不能透露有關資料。",
            "律政司及基金亦有一直審閱臨時遺產管理人的收費，倘雙方認為某筆費用過高或不合理，可向法庭提出申請，要求評定有關費用，以確保臨時遺產管理人的費用維持在合理的水平。",
            "（三）終審法院於二○一五年五月十八日就已故龔如心女士的遺囑所作的判決，裁定基金是以受託人的身分持有該筆遺產，而不是以無條件饋贈形式接收有關遺產。由於落實執行遺囑的工作仍在進行中，該判決並不影響現任獨立臨時遺產管理人繼續按法庭的委任履行上述妥善管理和保存該筆遺產的職責，直至法庭另有頒發命令為止。因此，現階段基金未有接管該筆遺產。律政司會繼續關注基金的財務狀況。",
            "在終審法院於二○一五年五月十八日頒下判決（終審法院判決）後，律政司一直與基金就擬備管理計劃的內容進行會面及保持溝通。為了促進有建設性及坦誠的討論，雙方同意在現階段將有關溝通的詳情保密。雙方曾討論擬備管理計劃的各具體事項，包括有關「監管機構」的設立，並參照二○○二遺囑的條文及終審法院判決所載的有關指示擬備了管理計劃擬稿。",
            "律政司與基金正積極討論管理計劃擬稿的內容，並希望盡快取得共識。如有需要，律政司或會在二○一九年第一季度就該管理計劃向法庭提出申請以尋求指示。",
            "此外，律政司將繼續就執行該遺囑的詳細安排與臨時遺產管理人保持聯絡及在適時索取有關資料。",

            "（一）及（二）立法會司法及法律事務委員會委員於二○一五年七月二十日舉行的會議中要求律政司提供資料，闡述（甲）法庭就該筆遺產批准的臨時管理安排，（乙）華懋集團管治委員會內各成員的背景、資歷及薪酬，以及（丙）該筆遺產下的財產的分項資料",
            "律政司司長於本年一月三十一日在立法會會議上回應謝偉俊議員提問的答覆中，已詳細解釋法庭就該筆遺產批准的臨時管理安排",
            "自二○○七年十二月十日起，該筆遺產按照法庭所頒的命令，由原訟法庭委任的獨立臨時遺產管理人作臨時管理",
            "現時的臨時遺產管理人由羅兵咸永道會計師事務所的陳偉棠、庄日杰及黃德偉出任",
            "臨時遺產管理人的工作一直受法庭監管，包括審閱其定期提交的報告和其他相關資料",
            "律政司一直以來也有密切關注該筆遺產的管理狀況及與臨時遺產管理人保持緊密聯繫，包括審閱臨時遺產管理人的定期報告、進一步向臨時遺產管理人了解相關事宜、按情況及需要要求臨時遺產管理人作出跟進和匯報、協助法庭處理臨時遺產管理人在過程中提出的法律程序，以及在有需要時就該筆遺產的臨時遺產管理事宜向法庭尋求指示",
            "律政司會繼續密切關注臨時遺產管理人就該筆遺產的管理和保存的工作，以及牽涉華懋集團及基金的法律訴訟，並在有需要時作出適當的跟進",
            "就該筆遺產的資料，律政司已向有關人士索取更新資料",
            "經取得他們的同意，現將可以公開的資料載列如下:",
            "該筆遺產的核心資產包括華懋集團內各公司的資產",
            "按有關未經審核的合計管理報表，截至二○一八年八月三十一日為止，華懋集團的資產淨值約為港幣一千三百七十億元",
            "根據終審法院二○一五年五月十八日頒下的判決，華懋集團於二○一二年的資產值約超過港幣八百二十億元",
            "由於華懋集團不是上市公司，在徵詢了有關人士的意見後，除上述資產淨值外，律政司不便透露財產分項的詳情，因當中涉及敏感及機密資料",
            "華懋集團由管治委員會監督，現任成員如下（按英文姓氏排序（臨時遺產管理人除外））:",
            "（一）陳鑑波（集團財務總監）；",
            "（二）蔡宏興（集團行政總裁）；",
            "（三）龔仁心醫生（集團管治委員會會議主席）；",
            "（四）梁煒才（集團司庫及土地評估部主管）；",
            "（五）劉元春（集團人力資源部主管）；",
            "（六）吳崇武（集團銷售部主管）；",
            "（七）王弘瀚（集團租務部副主管及營運總監）；",
            "（八）區兆邦（臨時遺產管理人的代表）；",
            "（九）陳偉棠（其中一位臨時遺產管理人）；及",
            "（十）庄日杰（其中一位臨時遺產管理人）",
            "在二○一五至二○一八年期間（截至二○一八年十一月三十日為止），華懋集團每年均向不同的慈善機構及其他單位捐款作慈善用途，總額超過港幣二千二百萬元",
            "在上述期間，每年捐出總額分別為約港幣九百七十萬元、港幣五百萬元、港幣四百萬元及港幣三百萬元",
            "至於有關獨立臨時遺產管理人收取的費用，在法庭的委任命令經已有所規定，並受法庭的監督",
            "由於有關命令是在非公開的聆訊作出，在法庭沒有頒令披露的情況下，我們不能透露有關資料",
            "律政司及基金亦有一直審閱臨時遺產管理人的收費，倘雙方認為某筆費用過高或不合理，可向法庭提出申請，要求評定有關費用，以確保臨時遺產管理人的費用維持在合理的水平",
            "（三）終審法院於二○一五年五月十八日就已故龔如心女士的遺囑所作的判決，裁定基金是以受託人的身分持有該筆遺產，而不是以無條件饋贈形式接收有關遺產",
            "由於落實執行遺囑的工作仍在進行中，該判決並不影響現任獨立臨時遺產管理人繼續按法庭的委任履行上述妥善管理和保存該筆遺產的職責，直至法庭另有頒發命令為止",
            "因此，現階段基金未有接管該筆遺產",
            "律政司會繼續關注基金的財務狀況",
            "在終審法院於二○一五年五月十八日頒下判決（終審法院判決）後，律政司一直與基金就擬備管理計劃的內容進行會面及保持溝通",
            "為了促進有建設性及坦誠的討論，雙方同意在現階段將有關溝通的詳情保密",
            "雙方曾討論擬備管理計劃的各具體事項，包括有關「監管機構」的設立，並參照二○○二遺囑的條文及終審法院判決所載的有關指示擬備了管理計劃擬稿",
            "律政司與基金正積極討論管理計劃擬稿的內容，並希望盡快取得共識",
            "如有需要，律政司或會在二○一九年第一季度就該管理計劃向法庭提出申請以尋求指示",
            "此外，律政司將繼續就執行該遺囑的詳細安排與臨時遺產管理人保持聯絡及在適時索取有關資料",
            "2018年12月12日（星期三）"
