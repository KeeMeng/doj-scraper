            "The Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice today (September 5) released its annual report, \"Prosecutions Hong Kong 2016\", which reviews the Division's work and important cases of last year.",
            "In his fourth and last letter presenting the report as Director of Public Prosecutions to the Secretary for Justice, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, described the year 2016 as \"challenging yet fruitful\". In the Director's Overview, he explained the challenges faced by the prosecution team in terms of case load, as well as the difficult and controversial nature of the cases handled. This notwithstanding, prosecutors remained apolitical in handling their prosecution work. \"Our mindset is accordingly clear, and we make a point to keep it clear .... We shall not allow ourselves to be influenced by any irrelevant considerations,\" Mr Yeung said.",
            "In his letter to the Secretary for Justice, Mr Yeung also summarised the Prosecutions Division's work in 2016 in respect of the development of the criminal justice system. He said, \"We in 2016 took forward two separate public consultations, one on prosecution works in the Magistracy, and the other on the use of live television link by complainants when giving evidence on certain sexual offences.",
            "\"Our arguments in HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam & Anor contributed towards the revision by the court of the previous sentencing practice of giving a full one third discount to even court door pleas, which revision brought about far-reaching changes to plea patterns at all three levels of the court system.",
            "\"The Prosecutions Division also took active part in the exercise commenced in September 2016 by the Judiciary in modernising the case management regime in criminal proceedings in the Court of First Instance, leading to the finalisation and implementation of Practice Direction 9.3 in June this year.\" These efforts and achievements are further elaborated in the Director's Overview.",
            "It is also reported that with the appointment of Miss Anna Lai as Senior Counsel in 2016, the Prosecutions Division has, for the first time since establishment, four silks each heading one sub-division. Looking ahead, with the additional manpower resources acquired and resumption of recruitment of Court Prosecutors in 2017, it is Mr Yeung's view that \"the Prosecutions Division is well equipped to face new challenges in the future\".",
            "Apart from a detailed account of the main activities of and key cases handled by the different sub-divisions and units of the Prosecutions Division, this latest review also provides information on various trainings and conferences, both locally and internationally, in which prosecutors participated during the year. Moreover, the division also continued to actively reach out to its partners and the community by organising events such as Prosecution Week and the Meet the Community programme.",
            "The review also contains an interview with one ex-member of the Prosecutions Division – Mr Peter Power who retired in September 2016 as Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions – sharing his invaluable work experience, beliefs and views as a veteran prosecutor. Moreover, Professor Simon Young, who led the Continuing Legal Education Programme of the Division in the year, contributed an article on the Continuity of Continuing Legal Education for Hong Kong Prosecutors.",

            "刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師在第四封，亦是任內最後一封向律政司司長提交年報的信件中，形容二○一六年為「極具挑戰性，卻又碩果豐收」的一年。在年報的序言中，他指出檢控團隊在工作量以及案件的艱巨和富爭議性程度方面所面對的挑戰。儘管如此，檢控人員在處理檢控工作時仍保持政治中立。楊家雄說：「我們思維理念清晰，亦特意將其保持清晰……我們不容許自己受任何不相關的考慮因素影響。」",
            "在給律政司司長的信中，楊家雄亦總結了刑事檢控科於二○一六年在推動刑事司法制度發展方面的工作。他說：「二○一六年，我們分別進行兩項公眾諮詢，一項是關於在裁判法院的檢控工作，另一項涉及申訴人就某些性罪行的審訊以電視直播聯繫方式提供證據。」",
            "「在香港特別行政區 訴 吳文南及另一人案中，我們的論據有助法院修改以往的判刑慣例，即縱使被告在正式開審前一刻方才認罪，法院也給予三分之一的十足刑期減免。此項修改對全部三級法院的被告認罪模式帶來深遠影響。」",
            "「另一方面，司法機構在二○一六年九月展開工作，將原訟法庭刑事訴訟程序案件管理制度現代化，最終於今年六月敲定並實施《實務指示9.3》。刑事檢控科亦有積極參與所涉的諮詢工作。」年報的序言會進一步闡述這方面的努力和成果。",
            "年報亦提及隨着黎婉姬在二○一六年獲委任為資深大律師，刑事檢控科自成立以來首次有四位資深大律師各自領導一個分科。展望未來，楊家雄認為，在取得額外人力資源及在二○一七年恢復招聘法庭檢控主任的情況下，刑事檢控科現已整裝待發，迎接未來的新挑戰。",
            "這份最新的年報除詳述刑事檢控科不同分科及小組的主要工作和所處理的重要案件外，也提供有關檢控人員年內在本地及海外參加的各項培訓及會議的資訊。此外，刑事檢控科亦通過舉辦各種活動，如檢控週和「與公眾會面」計劃等，繼續積極與其合作夥伴及社會大眾保持聯繫。",
            "年報亦載有於二○一六年九月榮休的高級助理刑事檢控專員鮑偉華的專訪。鮑偉華作為一位經驗豐富的檢控官，分享了他的寶貴工作經驗、信念及見解。此外，為刑事檢控科主持持續法律進修課程的楊艾文教授撰寫了一篇有關香港檢控人員持續法律進修的文章。",
