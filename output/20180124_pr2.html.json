            "Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (January 24):",
            "Question:",
            "The Secretary for Justice (SJ) is a principal official under the Political Appointment System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The functions of SJ include controlling law drafting and criminal prosecutions, soliciting support from this Council and the public for government policies and proposals, etc. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the respective mechanisms currently in place for ensuring that the work of the Department of Justice (DoJ) relating to criminal prosecutions is free from any interference and for handling the situation that role conflicts have arisen between the exercise of criminal prosecution function by SJ and her exercise of other functions or her personal affairs;",
            "(2) of the number of times, in each of the past five years, for which the exercise of a function of SJ was transferred to the Solicitor General, the Director of Public Prosecutions or other law officers of DoJ in order to avoid any perceived or real role conflicts; among them, the number of times for which the work relating to criminal prosecutions was involved; and",
            "(3) given that the Special Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Human Rights of the Hong Kong Bar Association and a former Executive Council Member have separately proposed earlier on that SJ shall vest all decisions relating to criminal prosecutions in the Director of Public Prosecutions, to be made independently and free from any interference, to avoid the public perception that certain criminal prosecution decisions might have been affected by SJ's exercise of other functions, whether the Government will consider that proposal; if not, of the justifications for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The maintenance of public support and confidence in the criminal justice system is crucial for upholding the rule of law. To achieve this, it is important that prosecutorial independence should be ensured. In this regard, it is enshrined under Article 63 of the Basic Law that the Department of Justice (DoJ) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference. As head of DoJ, the Secretary for Justice (SJ) has a constitutional duty and responsibility to make decisions and supervise conduct of criminal prosecutions.",
            "Decisions to prosecute or not, as the case may be, must be based on an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and the law and be in accordance with the published Prosecution Code. The prosecution will consider whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute, and the test is whether the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate a reasonable prospect of conviction; if there is sufficient evidence to prosecute, the prosecution will then consider whether it is in the public interest to do so. The legal discussions within DoJ are always conducted with professionalism, free from political considerations, and, most importantly, in confidence. Some decisions are hard to make, but DoJ is duty bound to make decisions that are legally correct and free from any interference, difficult or unpalatable though they may be.",
            "In respect of the Hon Kenneth Leung's three questions regarding how to ensure the independence of the work of DoJ relating to criminal prosecution, the consolidated response of DoJ is as follows:",
            "There are appropriate checks and accountability mechanisms in place to ensure free and independent control of prosecutions in Hong Kong. In general, in circumstances where there is any actual or potential conflict of interest on his or her part, the SJ, after satisfying himself or herself that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has no connection with any of the persons or events concerned, will delegate to the DPP the authority to handle the matter (including the consideration of and decision as to whether any prosecution action is warranted). Moreover, should it transpire subsequently that the handling of any such legal proceedings or prosecutorial matters may give rise to any conflict of interest, actual or potential on the part of the legal officers who had been so delegated, the delegation given will be reviewed. Depending upon the facts of each individual case, independent advice from outside counsel may also be sought. This practice has been consistently applied.",
            "In a number of cases in recent years where there was such delegation (or a withdrawal of such delegation), the Administration would, as appropriate in the circumstances of the case, issue statements as to the arrangement at appropriate juncture. According to our records, in the 5-year period from 2013 to 2017, the number of occasions on which the former SJ delegated the exercise of certain functions to other legal officers within DoJ regarding cases with actual or potential conflict of interest, are 10 times, 11 times, four times, five times and nine times respectively. Apart from one occasion each in 2013, 2015 and 2016, and two occasions in 2017 involving civil proceedings, all other delegations related to criminal prosecution work.",
            "The abovementioned system has worked well in the past and will continue to do so. The making of prosecutorial decisions is governed by the Prosecution Code, free from influence from any actual or potential conflict of interest, and where charges are laid, the cases are considered by the Courts. DoJ would continue to review and enhance the declaration and delegation systems in DoJ in respect of actual or potential conflict of interest.",
            "Notwithstanding the above, we are aware that there are suggestions that the SJ should delegate all prosecutorial decisions to the DPP, so as to ensure the independence of such decisions. As I have pointed out just now, decisions to prosecute or not, as the case may be, must be based on an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and the law and be in accordance with the published Prosecution Code. In making the decisions, it must be free from any political considerations. Currently, the independence of prosecutorial decisions is sufficiently safeguarded by Article 63 of the Basic Law.",
            "Currently no review has been conducted, nor is there any timetable, on the issue of SJ vesting all decisions relating to criminal prosecutions in the DPP. However, DoJ is willing to listen to views that this Council, the legal professional bodies and the public may have. Any future consideration of the matter will be subject to the key principles set out above. In any event, all colleagues within DoJ (including the DPP, officers of the Prosecutions Division and myself) will remain conscious of the importance of prosecutorial independence, a cardinal principle that is stressed in the Prosecution Code. All prosecutorial decisions will continue to be made independently without political or other improper or undue influence.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "以下是今日（一月二十四日）在立法會會議上梁繼昌議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "律政司司長（司長）是香港特別行政區政府政治委任制度下的主要官員。司長的職能包括主管法例草擬和刑事檢控工作，以及就政府政策和建議爭取本會及公眾支持等。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）現時分別有何機制，確保律政司的刑事檢控工作不受干涉，以及處理司長行使刑事檢控職能，與她行使其他職能或與其個人事務發生角色衝突的情況；",
            "（二）過去五年，每年為免產生觀感上或實質上的角色衝突情況，司長的某項職能交由法律政策專員、刑事檢控專員或律政司內其他法律人員行使的次數；當中有多少次是與刑事檢控工作有關；及",
            "（三）鑑於大律師公會憲法及人權事務委員會及一名前行政會議成員早前分別建議，司長把刑事檢控決定一概交由刑事檢控專員在不受干預的情況下獨立作出，以免公眾認為某些刑事檢控決定或受司長行使其他職能所影響，政府會否考慮該項建議；若否，理據為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "維持公眾對刑事司法制度的支持和信心對維護法治至關重要。為了達到這個目的，我們必須確保檢控工作的獨立性。就此，《基本法》第六十三條規定，香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉。身為律政司的首長，律政司司長有憲制責任和職責就刑事檢控工作作出決定及監督該方面的工作。",
            "檢控與否的決定，必須就所得的證據和相關法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按照已頒布的《檢控守則》行事。控方須考慮是否有充分證據進行檢控，並以根據有關證據是否有合理機會達致定罪為驗證標準；如有充分證據進行檢控，控方繼而須考慮作出檢控是否符合公眾利益。律政司內一貫堅守專業精神，進行法律討論時，不作政治考慮，並且以保密尤為至要。有些決定不易作出，但不論如何艱巨，甚或不受歡迎，律政司責無旁貸，必須作出法律上正確的決定而不受任何干涉。",
            "就梁繼昌議員有關如何確保律政司獨立進行檢控工作的三個問題，律政司綜合回答如下︰",
            "當局設有適當的制衡和問責機制，確保香港檢控工作獨立自主。一般來說，如律政司司長遇有實際或潛在利益衝突的情況，在信納刑事檢控專員與任何相關人士或事件沒有關連後，會授權刑事檢控專員處理有關事宜（包括考慮應否展開檢控行動及就此作出決定）。此外，假若其後有關獲授權的法律人員處理相關法律程序或檢控工作時亦會面對實際或潛在利益衝突，有關授權會再作檢討。視乎每宗個別案件的案情，律政司也可能會尋求外間、外聘執業大律師的獨立意見。律政司一直沿用這做法。",
            "近年有一些案件涉及這種授權（或撤銷這種授權），當局都會按照案件的合適情況，在適當時候就有關安排發出聲明。根據我們的記錄，由二○一三年至二○一七年的五年內，前任律政司司長就有實際利益衝突或潛在利益衝突的個案，而要將某項職能交由律政司內其他法律人員行使的次數分別為10次、11次、四次、五次及九次；當中除於二○一三年、二○一五年、二○一六年各有一次及二○一七年有兩次涉及民事法律程序的授權外，其他所有的授權均是與刑事檢控工作有關。",
            "上述制度一直行之有效，將來也會如此。作出檢控決定須遵循《檢控守則》的規定，不受任何實際或潛在利益衝突影響，而一旦提出檢控，案件便交由法院審理。律政司會不斷檢討及優化律政司就有關實際或潛在利益衝突的申報及授權制度。",
            "雖然如此，我們知悉有建議認為司長應把刑事檢控決定一概交由刑事檢控專員作出，以保障有關決定的獨立性。正如我剛才指出，檢控與否的決定，必須就所得的證據和相關法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按照已公布的《檢控守則》行事。在作出決定時，不得有任何政治考慮。現時，檢控決定的獨立性已受到《基本法》第六十三條充分保障。",
            "我們現時未有就把刑事檢控決定一概交給刑事檢控專員事宜進行檢討，也未有時間表。然而，律政司願意聽取立法會、法律專業團體及公眾對此事的意見，而日後任何對此事宜的考慮會按上述關鍵原則進行。無論如何，檢控的獨立性是《檢控守則》所強調的基本原則，而所有的律政司同事（包括刑事檢控專員、刑事檢控科的人員及本人）會保持警覺，緊記檢控獨立的重要性。所有檢控決定會繼續在不受政治或其他不當或不必要的壓力左右的情況下獨立地作出。",
