            "Following is the transcript of remarks made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, after attending the seminar \"Legal and Dispute Resolution: Key for International Trade\" in Jakarta, Indonesia, today (September 17):",
            "Reporter: Do you think it is fair to say that separation of powers does exist under the legal framework as part of the common law regime?",
            "Secretary for Justice: In the context of separation of powers, we can describe that as a political doctrine; you can describe that as a principle of governance. In Hong Kong, there have been discussions about this doctrine or principle. But I think the crux of the matter as far as HKSAR is concerned, after July 1, 1997, one looks at nowhere but the Basic Law. The Basic Law is crystal clear, particularly if you look at Chapter 4 of the Basic Law. Chapter 4 deals with the political structure. And Article 43 states quite clearly that the Chief Executive is the head of the HKSAR. In that capacity, he represents HKSAR and it is also in the same provision that sets out the double accountability principle. And in so far as the rest of Chapter 4 is concerned, it goes on to deal with, first of all, the executive authorities of Hong Kong, then the legislative authorities of Hong Kong and the Judiciary of Hong Kong. If you look at the executive authorities of Hong Kong, Article 60 of the Basic Law also said the Chief Executive is the head of the HKSAR Government. In that sense, the position of the Chief Executive is very clearly set out in Hong Kong. But as we have been stressing ever since this incident has arisen, the important point is no one is suggesting that the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is above the law. I do not believe that is the intention of the speech in question either. I don't think anyone who has read the Basic Law would have understood it that way. And also I think one can see as a matter of fact, as a matter of daily operation ever since July 1, 1997, the Chief Executive has never been and will never be above the law. If you look at the crux of the matter, stripped of all the debates, which if I may say are not that really essential to the issue, the crux of the matter is whether one should have any concern that there is any suggestion of change of circumstances which would cause people to believe that the Chief Executive would be above the law. That I think is a question that can have only one answer and that the answer is no. The Chief Executive has been and will continue to be subject to the monitoring by the legislature and the Judiciary.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（九月十七日）出席在印尼雅加達舉行的「國際貿易的關鍵：法律及仲裁」研討會後，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者︰《基本法》解釋權是張曉明較大，抑或馬道立的權威較大？另外，你去年七月很清晰地說過，香港和西方一樣實行「三權分立」，可否再次澄清你這言論，目前香港是否實行「三權分立」？",
            "律政司司長：我覺得在這件事上，大家無謂再糾纏在一些字眼上。每個地方的制度不同，即使你說西方國家的「三權分立」，不同地方也有不同制度。香港很清楚，我們的制度是根據《基本法》，《基本法》制度的設計有兩點可以說是很清楚。第一是我們的行政、立法和司法權來自中央授權，這是第一點。授權後，《基本法》第四章處理「政治體制」時，亦將行政機關、立法機關和司法機關的權限寫得很清楚。我自己看這事，當然我理解是張曉明主任作該演說後，在社會上引起很多討論，這是可以理解的。但討論過程中，正如我星期一時回應，也有些不太客觀或持平的。我相信引致香港市民最擔心的，是究竟是否有些人將「超然」兩個字理解為「凌駕」呢？這絕對沒有這方面的問題，亦是為何我們說《基本法》寫得很清楚，在《基本法》的框架下，行政長官是香港特區和香港特區政府的首長，但亦非常清楚的是，他一定受立法和司法的機構的監管。司法獨立的原則亦完全沒有任何疑問。若你看張曉明主任那份演說，如果我沒有記錯，最少有兩部分有提及。我知道昨日馬道立法官亦出來說了一些意見。我相信馬法官的意見亦和我們一直理解《基本法》下的情況符合，亦反映香港非常尊重司法獨立的情況。所以你說「三權分立」應如何理解，我亦要問你用「三權分立」那個字時，究竟你自己的說法是怎樣。",
