            "Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2013 today (January 14):",
            "Chief Justice, Judges and other Members of the Judiciary, Chairman of the Bar Association, President of the Law Society, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:",
            "First of all, let me extend my warmest welcome to all the guests attending this event, especially those who travelled from the Mainland or overseas jurisdictions. Being an international city, Hong Kong welcomes every opportunity to have exchanges with other jurisdictions.",
            "As I only assumed office on July 1, 2012, this is the first Opening of the Legal Year that I have the privilege to attend as the Secretary for Justice. May I take this opportunity to report on certain recent development as well as to outline the key focuses of my work in the years ahead.",
            "Centre for Legal Service and Dispute Resolution",
            "A combination of factors including our free economy, our status as an international financial centre, our commercial network with other cities and our efficient legal system have placed Hong Kong in a good position to be a leading centre for legal services and dispute resolution in the Asian Pacific Region. Much effort has previously been made in this regard, and I have no doubt that this is a direction that we should continue to pursue.",
            "In September last year, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) established the CIETAC Hong Kong Arbitration Centre, which is the very first branch of CIETAC outside the Mainland. The presence of this centre, coupled with the Asia Office of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, reinforces Hong Kong's status as an international arbitration centre.",
            "Enforceability of arbitral award is a highly relevant consideration when parties consider where to arbitrate. Although Hong Kong arbitral awards are already enforceable in over 140 jurisdictions, we will continue to enlarge the enforcement network. In this regard, I wish to report that any previous doubt concerning the enforceability of Hong Kong arbitral awards in India was removed when the Indian Government declared in March 2012 that the People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macao) is a reciprocating partner for the purposes of enforcement of arbitral awards under the New York Convention. Further, just last Monday, Hong Kong and Macao concluded an Arrangement on Mutual Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards. This Arrangement will be implemented by way of amendments to the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609), which we plan to introduce within this legislative year.",
            "Last year also witnessed considerable development in the promotion of mediation. The Mediation Ordinance was enacted in June 2012 and came into operation on January 1, 2013. This Ordinance provides the legislative framework for the conduct of mediation in Hong Kong, with emphasis on protecting confidentiality. The Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association Ltd., which is an industry-led body incorporated in August 2012 and scheduled to commence operation in around April this year, will be responsible for setting training and accreditation standards as well as addressing disciplinary matters.",
            "The Department of Justice will continue to take an active role in promoting mediation. A new Steering Committee on Mediation has recently been set up, with three sub-committees respectively tasked to monitor regulatory matters, accreditation and training matters as well as public education and publicity. Amongst others, this Steering Committee will monitor the operation of the Mediation Ordinance, the setting of accreditation standards and other matters concerning the future development of mediation.",
            "The promotion of arbitration and mediation will not be confined to the territory of Hong Kong. Together with the relevant stakeholders, we are keeping a close interest in Qianhai and Nansha as well as emerging markets in Asia.",
            "Law Reform",
            "Every system of law has to evolve with the needs of the community it serves. This explains the importance of having a robust system of law reform. In Hong Kong, undoubtedly the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has made great contribution in this regard.",
            "In recent years, concerns have been expressed over the progress of implementation of LRC's recommendations and queries have been raised as to whether our law reform regime requires reform. My predecessor was instrumental in putting in place administrative measures for monitoring the progress of implementing LRC recommendations. I will continue to monitor the situation and will further explore ways to improve the overall situation including the process of research, deliberation and implementation.",
            "As regards implementation, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill will be introduced within this legislative year so as to implement the recommendations contained in the LRC Report on Privity of Contract. As regards the LRC Report on Class Action, a Working Group comprising representatives from the relevant sectors has recently been set up to consider the best way forward.",
            "Efforts will also be made to ensure that areas which may deserve reform will be considered by the LRC. In this regard, I would like to announce that the LRC has in its meeting last month decided to establish two sub-committees to consider the topics of archives law and access to information. I appreciate that the Ombudsman has recently also announced an investigation into related issues. The LRC will certainly take into account the result of the Ombudsman's investigation (if not invite their participation) and embark upon a comprehensive comparative study on the relevant laws in overseas jurisdictions with a view to considering whether, and if so, how the law in Hong Kong in this regard should be reformed.",
            "Legal Aid",
            "Effective access to justice is a fundamental part of the rule of law. Substantive legal rights would be of little value if one lacks the means to participate effectively in the justice system. In recent years, there have been calls for reform of our legal aid system. The Legal Aid Services Council is responsible for advising on our legal aid policy including the feasibility and desirability of the establishment of an independent legal aid authority. As I understand, a report will be tendered by the Legal Aid Services Council in due course. Whilst we need to have appropriate strategic planning and to balance competing demands for resources, the Administration is certainly prepared to consider constructive recommendations which can improve our legal aid system. When the report is made available, I would endeavour to work with my colleagues in the Administration to seriously consider the recommendations with a view to enhancing access to justice for the less privileged sector of our community as much as is practicable.",
            "Law Drafting",
            "Translating policies into legislations has never been an easy task. In Hong Kong, there is the added dimension that both Chinese and English are official languages. Accordingly, in the context of legislative drafting, it is not merely a matter of translating Chinese into English or vice versa. Instead, legislations should be properly drafted in both languages and in as plain a language (whether Chinese or English) as possible, so that it does not require a well-trained lawyer to understand the meaning of our legislations. In last October, we have a very experienced bilingual Law Draftsman joining the Department of Justice. Both of us see the desirability to explore ways to further improve the drafting of bilingual legislations.",
            "As part of the implementation of the Legislation Publication Ordinance (Cap. 614), our Law Drafting Division is pressing ahead with the establishment of an electronic database of all the Hong Kong legislations with legal status. The aim is to provide easy access to legislations with legal status, so as to replace the existing electronic version which does not enjoy any legal status and which is provided for information only. With proper funding, it is expected that the new electronic database can be implemented in around 2016 or 2017.",
            "Prosecution Work",
            "Criminal prosecution is an important part of the work undertaken by the Department of Justice. Article 63 of the Basic Law guarantees that criminal prosecutions should be free from any interference. Our Department will faithfully discharge this role in an independent and fair manner, so as to ensure that in all cases which warrant prosecution, criminals will be brought to justice, irrespective of his or her status or wealth.",
            "It is our goal to provide a modern, progressive, efficient and fair prosecution service so as to uphold the rule of law. The Prosecutions Division has in the past placed and will continue to place emphasis on continuous training and regular seminars. Preparation of training materials, such as the \"Criminal Advocacy Course Manual\" published last month, provide useful guidance to counsel within and outside our Department in the course of their prosecution work. Apart from conferences on topics including sentencing and cybercrime, there is the notable example of the Criminal Law Conference held in November last year where local and overseas judges, practitioners and academics gathered to exchange views on areas of criminal law which may deserve reform.",
            "Looking forward, the Heads of Prosecuting Agencies Conference will be held in May this year. There will also be other training courses including one on prosecuting animal cruelty cases. The Prosecution Division will continue to engage in exchanges with prosecution agencies of other jurisdictions to exchange ideas on matters of common interest, as well as to enhance co-operation so as to combat cross-border and transnational crimes and for the restraint and confiscation of proceeds of crime.",
            "To meet the changing needs of our work, we will keep the organisation of our Prosecutions Division under constant review. One initiative we have undertaken is to establish coordinators or specific units for handling specialised types of cases such as cybercrime.",
            "To enhance the general public's understanding of criminal prosecution and the criminal justice system, the programme known as \"Prosecution Week\" was held for the first time in July last year. Responses from the public were encouraging and we plan to organise similar events on an annual basis.",
            "As the media has reported, the incumbent Director of Public Prosecutions will retire later this year. We are embarking upon an open recruitment exercise, so as to identify a person of utmost integrity and great competence to take up this important role. If I may digress a little bit, I firmly believe that human resources are the most valuable assets of our Department. We are studying measures that can attract the bright and competent graduates and qualified lawyers to join us so as to meet our growing challenges.",
            "The International Dimension",
            "Thus far, I have dealt with matters which are largely domestic in nature. Certainly, we will not lose sight of the need to remain international. To continue Hong Kong's success story, it is of vital importance to ensure that our legal system and legal infrastructure can meet the needs of this globalised age. Last month, the Hague Conference on Private International Law established its Asia Pacific Regional Office in Hong Kong. Attracting similar internationally reputable law-related organisations to establish offices in Hong Kong is a policy we can ill afford not to pursue. In future, further efforts will be made in the same direction. The recent decision to allocate space in the West Wing of the former Central Government Offices to house such institutions bespeaks the Administration's support of this policy. Further, our International Law Division will continue to foster mutual legal assistance arrangements with other jurisdictions so as to strategically place ourselves in the world map of international legal co-operation.",
            "The Rule of Law",
            "Last but certainly not least, may I briefly deal with certain recent events which have given rise to lively public debates on matters concerning the rule of law. The fact that I address these matters at the end of my speech does not mean that I want to play down their importance. It is because I believe that although controversies certainly deserve our proper attention and management, they should not be allowed to become obstacles preventing us from taking actions that should have been taken in the best interest of Hong Kong.",
            "Let me make this point crystal clear. As the Secretary for Justice, I have every determination to steadfastly uphold the rule of law including judicial independence. Notwithstanding any suggestions to the contrary, there is simply no intention, let alone reason, to take any step to undermine the rule of law or judicial independence as we all agree that the rule of law is one of the key reasons underpinning Hong Kong's success. As a matter of fact, the work plan outlined earlier was prepared with the objective of upholding the rule of law and strengthening our legal system and legal infrastructure.",
            "Whenever legal proceedings would bring about significant social, economic or political impact on our society, it is perfectly understandable that they would give rise to public debates. However, it is an important part of the concept of the rule of law that legal issues should be allowed to be resolved through the judicial system. Accordingly, if we truly respect the rule of law, we should fully respect the legal right of a litigant to have legal issues resolved through the judicial system, irrespective of whether the litigant involved is an individual, a corporation or a government department. Indeed, if there are important legal issues that require resolution, a responsible Government should have the courage and determination to have the legal issue properly adjudicated by the judicial process irrespective of the divergent opinions such a step may generate.",
            "We have a world-class judiciary and true judicial independence. We should have every confidence that cases, however controversial they may be, will be decided by our Judges strictly in accordance with the law and in a fully independent manner. We of course fully respect freedom of speech and people's legal right to express their views. Caution, however, should be exercised so that Judges can decide cases in an environment free from undue interference or pressure of whatever form. Unlike the political process, the judicial process is not subject to any lobbying and should not be so.",
            "There is no doubt that we are facing challenges in one form or other. Like time, challenges wait for no man. However, courage, determination and faith in our legal system would enable us to overcome challenges (unprecedented or otherwise) and find appropriate solutions that will best serve the interest of Hong Kong as a whole.",
            "It remains for me to wish all of you a happy and prosperous year of 2013.",
            "Ends/Monday, January 14, 2013"

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（一月十四日）在二○一三年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位法官及司法機構成員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：",
            "首先，我歡迎各位出席是次開啟典禮的嘉賓，特別是從內地或海外司法管轄區前來的嘉賓。作為國際城市，香港歡迎每一個可與其他司法管轄區進行交流的機會。",
            "由於我在二○一二年七月一日才出任律政司司長一職，這是我首次有幸以這個身分出席法律年度開啟典禮。我希望藉此機會，向大家匯報若干新進展及簡述未來數年的工作重點。",
            "法律服務和解決爭議中心",
            "我們的自由經濟體系、國際金融中心地位、與其他城市的商業網絡、高效率的法律制度等因素，在在都促使香港有優勢成為亞太區重要的法律服務和解決爭議中心。這是前人過去努力耕耘的成果，我深信我們應該繼續朝這方向邁進。",
            "去年九月，中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會（貿仲委）設立貿仲委香港仲裁中心。該中心是貿仲委首個在內地以外設立的分支。該中心的成立，加上國際商會國際仲裁院在香港設立的亞洲秘書處分處，令香港作為國際仲裁中心的地位更加鞏固。",
            "仲裁各方考慮仲裁地點時，仲裁裁決能否強制執行是一個相關因素。雖然現時在香港作出的仲裁裁決已可在超過140個司法管轄區強制執行，我們仍會繼續拓展這個網絡，使本港仲裁裁決能在更多地方強制執行。在這方面，印度政府在二○一二年三月宣布，確認中華人民共和國（包括香港和澳門）是《紐約公約》下強制執行仲裁裁決的相互執行夥伴，從而徹底消除了先前有關香港仲裁裁決可否在印度強制執行的疑慮。再者，香港與澳門剛在上周一簽訂《相互認可和執行仲裁裁決的安排》（《安排》）。我們計劃在本立法年度內就《仲裁條例》（第609章）提出相應修訂，從而落實該《安排》。",
            "調解推廣工作在去年亦取得相當進展。《調解條例》在二○一二年六月通過，並在二○一三年一月一日生效。該條例為在香港進行的調解提供法律框架，當中特別重保障調解通訊的保密性。此外，香港調解資歷評審協會有限公司於二○一二年八月成立，該協會由業界主導，預計在本年四月左右開始運作，負責就培訓和資格評審訂立準則，並處理紀律事宜。",
            "律政司將會繼續積極提倡調解服務。我們剛成立調解督導委員會，並在其下設立三個小組委員會，分別負責監察規管、資格評審、培訓及公眾教育和宣傳的事宜。督導委員會的主要工作包括監察《調解條例》的實施情況、制定評審資格的標準，以及其他與調解未來發展相關的事宜。",
            "推廣仲裁及調解的工作將不會局限於香港境內。我們正與相關持份者共同密切留意前海、南沙及亞洲新興市場的發展情況。",
            "法律改革",
            "所有法律體系均須因應社會的需要而演進，這說明健全法律改革制度的重要性。法律改革委員會（法改會）在這方面對香港無疑作出極大貢獻。",
            "近年，有社會人士就落實法改會建議的進度表達關注，甚或提出香港法律改革機制是否需要改革。為監察落實法改會建議工作的進度，前任律政司司長致力推出相關行政措施。我會延續這方面的工作，監察相關情況，並會進一步探討改善整體法律改革工作的方案，包括研究、審議及落實建議的過程。",
            "在推行方面，我們將會在本立法年度提交《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》，以落實法改會在《立約各方的相互關係報告書》所載的建議。至於法改會提交的《集體訴訟報告書》，律政司最近成立了一個由相關界別代表組成的工作小組，負責考慮這方面工作應如何向前邁進。",
            "我們亦會致力確保有需要考慮改革的議題會透過法改會進行研究。在這方面，我想向大家宣布，法改會在上月舉行的會議上決定成立兩個小組委員會，將分別研究「檔案法」及「公開資料」這兩個課題。我知悉申訴專員最近亦宣布就相關問題進行調查。無論申訴專員會否參與法改會的相關研究工作，法改會也必定會考慮申訴專員的調查結果，同時手全面研究和比較香港與海外司法管轄區的相關法律，以便考慮香港是否須改革這方面的法例，及如須改革，改革應如何進行。",
            "法律援助",
            "市民能有效地尋求司法公義是法治的重要元素。縱有實質法律權利，但若市民無從有效地參與司法制度，任何權利亦徒具意義。近年有社會人士要求改革本港法律援助制度。法律援助服務局負責就本港法律援助政策作出建議，當中包括考慮建立獨立的法律援助管理局的可行性及可取性。據我所知，該局稍後便會提交報告書。我們固然要作出適當的策略性規劃，並平衡不同界別對資源的需求。但就任何可改善本港法律援助制度的真知灼見，當局定會樂意考慮。當報告書備妥後，我會盡力與各有關部門的同事合作，詳細考慮各項建議，以期在切實可行的範圍內，協助社會的弱勢社群能得到法律服務。",
            "法律草擬工作",
            "將政策演化成為法例絕非易事。在香港，這項工作更是難上加難，因為中文和英文均為法定語文。因此，草擬法例不是簡單的中英或英中對譯工作，而應以兩種語文妥為草擬法例文本，並盡可能使用淺白的文字（中文或英文亦然），以便即使沒有律師資格的人士也能明白法例的涵意。去年十月，一位非常資深並具備雙語能力的法律草擬專員加入律政司。我倆都認為適宜探討如何進一步改善雙語法例的草擬工作。",
            "律政司法律草擬科現正致力建立具有法定地位的香港法例電子資料庫，作為實施《法例發布條例》（第614章）的部分工作。建立資料庫的目的，是讓公眾能輕易閱覽具有法定地位的法例條文，並藉此取代現時沒有法律地位及只供參考的電子版本。如獲得恰當撥款，新的電子資料庫預計可在二○一六或二○一七年左右開始投入服務。",
            "檢控工作",
            "刑事檢控是律政司工作的重要一環。《基本法》第六十三條保障刑事檢控工作不受任何干涉。我們將以公正獨立的態度，忠誠地履行這項職責，確保所有應被檢控的人，不論其地位高低或財富多寡，都會被繩之以法。",
            "我們的目標是提供現代、進取、高效率和公平的檢控服務，力求維護法治。刑事檢控科一直致力提供持續培訓和定期舉辦研討會，日後亦會繼續這方面的工作。該科擬備培訓教材，例如上月出版的《刑事訟辯課程手冊》，為律政司和私人執業的律師提供檢控工作的指引。除舉辦量刑、電腦罪行等課題的研討會外，去年的重頭戲是在十一月舉辦刑事法律研討會，讓本地和海外的法官、律師及學者齊集一堂，就刑事法律改革之課題交換意見。",
            "展望未來，檢察機關首長會議將在本年五月舉行。此外，我們亦安排了其他培訓課程，包括一個關於檢控虐待動物案件的課程。刑事檢控科會繼續與其他司法管轄區的檢控機構進行交流，就共同關注的事宜交換意見，並加強彼此合作，打擊跨境或國際罪案，及限制或沒收犯罪得益。",
            "為應付不斷轉變的工作需要，我們會不時檢討刑事檢控科的架構。我們已採取的其中一項措施，是設立協調員或特定小組，負責處理電腦罪行等特定類別的案件。",
            "為使市民加深認識刑事檢控及刑事司法制度，我們去年七月首次舉辦「香港檢控週」。由於市民對該活動的反應令人鼓舞，我們計劃每年均會舉辦同類活動。",
            "正如傳媒報道，現任刑事檢控專員將在本年稍後時間退休。我們現正進行公開招聘，以便物色一位持正不阿、傑出能幹的人士來擔當這項重要職責。在此請容許我稍談另一事宜。我堅信人力資源是律政司最寶貴的資產，因此我們正在研究有何措施，可吸引優秀的畢業生和勝任的律師加入律政司，以應付與日俱增的挑戰。",
            "國際視野",
            "以上所述，大都是本地層面的事宜。當然，我們不會忽略香港必須保持國際視野。在這個全球化年代，要延續香港的成功故事，確保本地法律制度和法律基建能與時並進確實十分重要。去年十二月，海牙國際私法會議在香港成立亞太區區域辦事處。吸引國際上其他享負盛名的法律機構來港設立辦事處的政策必須持之以恆，日後我們會繼續朝這方向展開工作。當局最近決定在前中區政府合署西座撥出辦公地方供這類機構使用，正正顯示當局對這項政策的支持。此外，律政司國際法律科將繼續致力與其他司法管轄區訂立相互法律協助的相關安排，從而讓香港在國際法律合作的世界版圖上佔一重要席位。",
            "法治",
            "最後，我希望簡短地談述近期引起公眾對法治議題進行激烈辯論的某些事宜。我在致辭尾段才論及這些事情，並非有意淡化這些事情的重要性。我深信雖然爭議值得我們適當地關注和處理，但不應成為絆腳石，妨礙我們進行從香港最佳利益眼而應採取的行動。",
            "關於這一點，我想清楚說明，作為律政司司長，我定必堅定不移地維護法治和司法獨立。儘管有人可能持不同意見，但我確實沒有意圖，更加沒有理由，用任何手段損害法治或司法獨立，因為我們大家都認同，法治是香港賴以成功的其中一個重要原因。事實上，剛才簡述的工作計劃，目的正是維護法治及鞏固我們的法律制度和法律建設。",
            "每當有法律程序對社會、經濟或政治帶來重大影響，都會引起公眾爭議，這是完全可以理解的。然而，法律問題應該透過司法制度解決，這是法治概念的重要一環。因此，假如我們真的尊重法治，則不論訴訟人是個人、公司或政府部門，我們都應絕對尊重訴訟人透過司法體系解決法律問題的法律權利。事實上，一個負責任的政府，在面對重大法律問題須予解決時，應該有勇氣和決心，設法把法律問題交由司法程序妥善裁定，而不論此舉會否帶來爭議。",
            "香港擁有世界級的司法機構，亦享有真正的司法獨立。我們應該有信心，無論案件如何具爭議性，我們的法官也會完全獨立地嚴格按照法律就案件作出裁決。我們當然絕對尊重言論自由和公眾發表意見的法律權利。然而，我們必須保持謹慎，讓法官能夠在沒有不當干擾或任何形式壓力的環境下判案。與政治過程不同，司法程序不受游說，亦不應受到游說。",
            "毫無疑問，我們正面對各種各樣的挑戰。與時光無異，處理挑戰亦不容蹉跎。只要我們懷勇氣和決心，對我們的法律制度抱持堅定不移的信念，無論面對的挑戰是否前所未見，我們定能克服及找到最切合香港社會整體利益的解決方案。",
            "最後，我在此祝願各位有愉快豐盛的新一年。",

            "Amongst others, this Steering Committee will monitor the operation of the Mediation Ordinance, the setting of accreditation standards and other matters concerning the future development of mediation.",
            "The promotion of arbitration and mediation will not be confined to the territory of Hong Kong",
            "Together with the relevant stakeholders, we are keeping a close interest in Qianhai and Nansha as well as emerging markets in Asia.",
            "Law Reform",
            "Every system of law has to evolve with the needs of the community it serves",
            "This explains the importance of having a robust system of law reform",
            "In Hong Kong, undoubtedly the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has made great contribution in this regard.",
            "In recent years, concerns have been expressed over the progress of implementation of LRC's recommendations and queries have been raised as to whether our law reform regime requires reform",
            "My predecessor was instrumental in putting in place administrative measures for monitoring the progress of implementing LRC recommendations",
            "I will continue to monitor the situation and will further explore ways to improve the overall situation including the process of research, deliberation and implementation.",
            "As regards implementation, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill will be introduced within this legislative year so as to implement the recommendations contained in the LRC Report on Privity of Contract",
            "As regards the LRC Report on Class Action, a Working Group comprising representatives from the relevant sectors has recently been set up to consider the best way forward.",
            "Efforts will also be made to ensure that areas which may deserve reform will be considered by the LRC",
            "In this regard, I would like to announce that the LRC has in its meeting last month decided to establish two sub-committees to consider the topics of archives law and access to information",
            "I appreciate that the Ombudsman has recently also announced an investigation into related issues",
            "The LRC will certainly take into account the result of the Ombudsman's investigation (if not invite their participation) and embark upon a comprehensive comparative study on the relevant laws in overseas jurisdictions with a view to considering whether, and if so, how the law in Hong Kong in this regard should be reformed.",
            "Legal Aid",
            "Effective access to justice is a fundamental part of the rule of law",
            "Substantive legal rights would be of little value if one lacks the means to participate effectively in the justice system",
            "In recent years, there have been calls for reform of our legal aid system",
            "The Legal Aid Services Council is responsible for advising on our legal aid policy including the feasibility and desirability of the establishment of an independent legal aid authority",
            "As I understand, a report will be tendered by the Legal Aid Services Council in due course",
            "Whilst we need to have appropriate strategic planning and to balance competing demands for resources, the Administration is certainly prepared to consider constructive recommendations which can improve our legal aid system",
            "When the report is made available, I would endeavour to work with my colleagues in the Administration to seriously consider the recommendations with a view to enhancing access to justice for the less privileged sector of our community as much as is practicable.",
            "Law Drafting",
            "Translating policies into legislations has never been an easy task",
            "In Hong Kong, there is the added dimension that both Chinese and English are official languages",
            "Accordingly, in the context of legislative drafting, it is not merely a matter of translating Chinese into English or vice versa",
            "Instead, legislations should be properly drafted in both languages and in as plain a language (whether Chinese or English) as possible, so that it does not require a well-trained lawyer to understand the meaning of our legislations",
            "In last October, we have a very experienced bilingual Law Draftsman joining the Department of Justice",
            "Both of us see the desirability to explore ways to further improve the drafting of bilingual legislations.",
            "As part of the implementation of the Legislation Publication Ordinance (Cap",
            "614), our Law Drafting Division is pressing ahead with the establishment of an electronic database of all the Hong Kong legislations with legal status",
            "The aim is to provide easy access to legislations with legal status, so as to replace the existing electronic version which does not enjoy any legal status and which is provided for information only",
            "With proper funding, it is expected that the new electronic database can be implemented in around 2016 or 2017.",
            "Prosecution Work",
            "Criminal prosecution is an important part of the work undertaken by the Department of Justice",
            "Article 63 of the Basic Law guarantees that criminal prosecutions should be free from any interference",
            "Our Department will faithfully discharge this role in an independent and fair manner, so as to ensure that in all cases which warrant prosecution, criminals will be brought to justice, irrespective of his or her status or wealth.",
            "It is our goal to provide a modern, progressive, efficient and fair prosecution service so as to uphold the rule of law",
            "The Prosecutions Division has in the past placed and will continue to place emphasis on continuous training and regular seminars",
            "Preparation of training materials, such as the \"Criminal Advocacy Course Manual\" published last month, provide useful guidance to counsel within and outside our Department in the course of their prosecution work",
            "Apart from conferences on topics including sentencing and cybercrime, there is the notable example of the Criminal Law Conference held in November last year where local and overseas judges, practitioners and academics gathered to exchange views on areas of criminal law which may deserve reform.",
            "Looking forward, the Heads of Prosecuting Agencies Conference will be held in May this year",
            "There will also be other training courses including one on prosecuting animal cruelty cases",
            "The Prosecution Division will continue to engage in exchanges with prosecution agencies of other jurisdictions to exchange ideas on matters of common interest, as well as to enhance co-operation so as to combat cross-border and transnational crimes and for the restraint and confiscation of proceeds of crime.",
            "To meet the changing needs of our work, we will keep the organisation of our Prosecutions Division under constant review",
            "One initiative we have undertaken is to establish coordinators or specific units for handling specialised types of cases such as cybercrime.",
            "To enhance the general public's understanding of criminal prosecution and the criminal justice system, the programme known as \"Prosecution Week\" was held for the first time in July last year",
            "Responses from the public were encouraging and we plan to organise similar events on an annual basis.",
            "As the media has reported, the incumbent Director of Public Prosecutions will retire later this year",
            "We are embarking upon an open recruitment exercise, so as to identify a person of utmost integrity and great competence to take up this important role",
            "If I may digress a little bit, I firmly believe that human resources are the most valuable assets of our Department",
            "We are studying measures that can attract the bright and competent graduates and qualified lawyers to join us so as to meet our growing challenges.",
            "The International Dimension",
            "Thus far, I have dealt with matters which are largely domestic in nature",
            "Certainly, we will not lose sight of the need to remain international",
            "To continue Hong Kong's success story, it is of vital importance to ensure that our legal system and legal infrastructure can meet the needs of this globalised age",
            "Last month, the Hague Conference on Private International Law established its Asia Pacific Regional Office in Hong Kong",
            "Attracting similar internationally reputable law-related organisations to establish offices in Hong Kong is a policy we can ill afford not to pursue",
            "In future, further efforts will be made in the same direction",
            "The recent decision to allocate space in the West Wing of the former Central Government Offices to house such institutions bespeaks the Administration's support of this policy",
            "Further, our International Law Division will continue to foster mutual legal assistance arrangements with other jurisdictions so as to strategically place ourselves in the world map of international legal co-operation.",
            "The Rule of Law",
            "Last but certainly not least, may I briefly deal with certain recent events which have given rise to lively public debates on matters concerning the rule of law",
            "The fact that I address these matters at the end of my speech does not mean that I want to play down their importance",
            "It is because I believe that although controversies certainly deserve our proper attention and management, they should not be allowed to become obstacles preventing us from taking actions that should have been taken in the best interest of Hong Kong.",
            "Let me make this point crystal clear",
            "As the Secretary for Justice, I have every determination to steadfastly uphold the rule of law including judicial independence",
            "Notwithstanding any suggestions to the contrary, there is simply no intention, let alone reason, to take any step to undermine the rule of law or judicial independence as we all agree that the rule of law is one of the key reasons underpinning Hong Kong's success",
            "As a matter of fact, the work plan outlined earlier was prepared with the objective of upholding the rule of law and strengthening our legal system and legal infrastructure.",
            "Whenever legal proceedings would bring about significant social, economic or political impact on our society, it is perfectly understandable that they would give rise to public debates",
            "However, it is an important part of the concept of the rule of law that legal issues should be allowed to be resolved through the judicial system",
            "Accordingly, if we truly respect the rule of law, we should fully respect the legal right of a litigant to have legal issues resolved through the judicial system, irrespective of whether the litigant involved is an individual, a corporation or a government department",
            "Indeed, if there are important legal issues that require resolution, a responsible Government should have the courage and determination to have the legal issue properly adjudicated by the judicial process irrespective of the divergent opinions such a step may generate.",
            "We have a world-class judiciary and true judicial independence",
            "We should have every confidence that cases, however controversial they may be, will be decided by our Judges strictly in accordance with the law and in a fully independent manner",
            "We of course fully respect freedom of speech and people's legal right to express their views",
            "Caution, however, should be exercised so that Judges can decide cases in an environment free from undue interference or pressure of whatever form",
            "Unlike the political process, the judicial process is not subject to any lobbying and should not be so.",
            "There is no doubt that we are facing challenges in one form or other",
            "Like time, challenges wait for no man",
            "However, courage, determination and faith in our legal system would enable us to overcome challenges (unprecedented or otherwise) and find appropriate solutions that will best serve the interest of Hong Kong as a whole.",
            "It remains for me to wish all of you a happy and prosperous year of 2013.",

            "這是前人過去努力耕耘的成果，我深信我們應該繼續朝這方向邁進",
            "去年九月，中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會（貿仲委）設立貿仲委香港仲裁中心",
            "該中心是貿仲委首個在內地以外設立的分支",
            "該中心的成立，加上國際商會國際仲裁院在香港設立的亞洲秘書處分處，令香港作為國際仲裁中心的地位更加鞏固",
            "仲裁各方考慮仲裁地點時，仲裁裁決能否強制執行是一個相關因素",
            "雖然現時在香港作出的仲裁裁決已可在超過140個司法管轄區強制執行，我們仍會繼續拓展這個網絡，使本港仲裁裁決能在更多地方強制執行",
            "在這方面，印度政府在二○一二年三月宣布，確認中華人民共和國（包括香港和澳門）是《紐約公約》下強制執行仲裁裁決的相互執行夥伴，從而徹底消除了先前有關香港仲裁裁決可否在印度強制執行的疑慮",
            "再者，香港與澳門剛在上周一簽訂《相互認可和執行仲裁裁決的安排》（《安排》）",
            "我們計劃在本立法年度內就《仲裁條例》（第609章）提出相應修訂，從而落實該《安排》",
            "調解推廣工作在去年亦取得相當進展",
            "《調解條例》在二○一二年六月通過，並在二○一三年一月一日生效",
            "該條例為在香港進行的調解提供法律框架，當中特別重保障調解通訊的保密性",
            "此外，香港調解資歷評審協會有限公司於二○一二年八月成立，該協會由業界主導，預計在本年四月左右開始運作，負責就培訓和資格評審訂立準則，並處理紀律事宜",
            "律政司將會繼續積極提倡調解服務",

            "為監察落實法改會建議工作的進度，前任律政司司長致力推出相關行政措施",
            "我會延續這方面的工作，監察相關情況，並會進一步探討改善整體法律改革工作的方案，包括研究、審議及落實建議的過程",
            "在推行方面，我們將會在本立法年度提交《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》，以落實法改會在《立約各方的相互關係報告書》所載的建議",
            "至於法改會提交的《集體訴訟報告書》，律政司最近成立了一個由相關界別代表組成的工作小組，負責考慮這方面工作應如何向前邁進",
            "我們亦會致力確保有需要考慮改革的議題會透過法改會進行研究",
            "在這方面，我想向大家宣布，法改會在上月舉行的會議上決定成立兩個小組委員會，將分別研究「檔案法」及「公開資料」這兩個課題",
            "我知悉申訴專員最近亦宣布就相關問題進行調查",
            "無論申訴專員會否參與法改會的相關研究工作，法改會也必定會考慮申訴專員的調查結果，同時手全面研究和比較香港與海外司法管轄區的相關法律，以便考慮香港是否須改革這方面的法例，及如須改革，改革應如何進行",

            "市民能有效地尋求司法公義是法治的重要元素",
            "縱有實質法律權利，但若市民無從有效地參與司法制度，任何權利亦徒具意義",
            "近年有社會人士要求改革本港法律援助制度",
            "法律援助服務局負責就本港法律援助政策作出建議，當中包括考慮建立獨立的法律援助管理局的可行性及可取性",
            "據我所知，該局稍後便會提交報告書",
            "我們固然要作出適當的策略性規劃，並平衡不同界別對資源的需求",

            "在香港，這項工作更是難上加難，因為中文和英文均為法定語文",
            "因此，草擬法例不是簡單的中英或英中對譯工作，而應以兩種語文妥為草擬法例文本，並盡可能使用淺白的文字（中文或英文亦然），以便即使沒有律師資格的人士也能明白法例的涵意",
            "去年十月，一位非常資深並具備雙語能力的法律草擬專員加入律政司",
            "我倆都認為適宜探討如何進一步改善雙語法例的草擬工作",
            "律政司法律草擬科現正致力建立具有法定地位的香港法例電子資料庫，作為實施《法例發布條例》（第614章）的部分工作",
            "建立資料庫的目的，是讓公眾能輕易閱覽具有法定地位的法例條文，並藉此取代現時沒有法律地位及只供參考的電子版本",

            "我們的目標是提供現代、進取、高效率和公平的檢控服務，力求維護法治",
            "刑事檢控科一直致力提供持續培訓和定期舉辦研討會，日後亦會繼續這方面的工作",
            "該科擬備培訓教材，例如上月出版的《刑事訟辯課程手冊》，為律政司和私人執業的律師提供檢控工作的指引",
            "除舉辦量刑、電腦罪行等課題的研討會外，去年的重頭戲是在十一月舉辦刑事法律研討會，讓本地和海外的法官、律師及學者齊集一堂，就刑事法律改革之課題交換意見",
            "展望未來，檢察機關首長會議將在本年五月舉行",

            "為應付不斷轉變的工作需要，我們會不時檢討刑事檢控科的架構",

            "為使市民加深認識刑事檢控及刑事司法制度，我們去年七月首次舉辦「香港檢控週」",
            "由於市民對該活動的反應令人鼓舞，我們計劃每年均會舉辦同類活動",
            "正如傳媒報道，現任刑事檢控專員將在本年稍後時間退休",
            "我們現正進行公開招聘，以便物色一位持正不阿、傑出能幹的人士來擔當這項重要職責",
            "在此請容許我稍談另一事宜",
            "我堅信人力資源是律政司最寶貴的資產，因此我們正在研究有何措施，可吸引優秀的畢業生和勝任的律師加入律政司，以應付與日俱增的挑戰",
            "國際視野",
            "以上所述，大都是本地層面的事宜",
            "當然，我們不會忽略香港必須保持國際視野",
            "在這個全球化年代，要延續香港的成功故事，確保本地法律制度和法律基建能與時並進確實十分重要",
            "去年十二月，海牙國際私法會議在香港成立亞太區區域辦事處",
            "吸引國際上其他享負盛名的法律機構來港設立辦事處的政策必須持之以恆，日後我們會繼續朝這方向展開工作",
            "當局最近決定在前中區政府合署西座撥出辦公地方供這類機構使用，正正顯示當局對這項政策的支持",
            "此外，律政司國際法律科將繼續致力與其他司法管轄區訂立相互法律協助的相關安排，從而讓香港在國際法律合作的世界版圖上佔一重要席位",
            "法治",
            "最後，我希望簡短地談述近期引起公眾對法治議題進行激烈辯論的某些事宜",
            "我在致辭尾段才論及這些事情，並非有意淡化這些事情的重要性",
            "我深信雖然爭議值得我們適當地關注和處理，但不應成為絆腳石，妨礙我們進行從香港最佳利益眼而應採取的行動",
            "關於這一點，我想清楚說明，作為律政司司長，我定必堅定不移地維護法治和司法獨立",
            "儘管有人可能持不同意見，但我確實沒有意圖，更加沒有理由，用任何手段損害法治或司法獨立，因為我們大家都認同，法治是香港賴以成功的其中一個重要原因",
            "事實上，剛才簡述的工作計劃，目的正是維護法治及鞏固我們的法律制度和法律建設",
            "每當有法律程序對社會、經濟或政治帶來重大影響，都會引起公眾爭議，這是完全可以理解的",
            "然而，法律問題應該透過司法制度解決，這是法治概念的重要一環",
            "因此，假如我們真的尊重法治，則不論訴訟人是個人、公司或政府部門，我們都應絕對尊重訴訟人透過司法體系解決法律問題的法律權利",
            "事實上，一個負責任的政府，在面對重大法律問題須予解決時，應該有勇氣和決心，設法把法律問題交由司法程序妥善裁定，而不論此舉會否帶來爭議",
            "香港擁有世界級的司法機構，亦享有真正的司法獨立",
            "我們應該有信心，無論案件如何具爭議性，我們的法官也會完全獨立地嚴格按照法律就案件作出裁決",
            "我們當然絕對尊重言論自由和公眾發表意見的法律權利",
            "然而，我們必須保持謹慎，讓法官能夠在沒有不當干擾或任何形式壓力的環境下判案",
            "與政治過程不同，司法程序不受游說，亦不應受到游說",
            "毫無疑問，我們正面對各種各樣的挑戰",
            "與時光無異，處理挑戰亦不容蹉跎",
            "只要我們懷勇氣和決心，對我們的法律制度抱持堅定不移的信念，無論面對的挑戰是否前所未見，我們定能克服及找到最切合香港社會整體利益的解決方案",
