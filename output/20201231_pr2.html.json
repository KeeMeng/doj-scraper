            "The DoJ always attaches great importance to the discharge of its constitutional duty in criminal prosecutions, free from any interference. Prosecutorial decisions should be based on an objective assessment of all admissible evidence and applicable laws, made strictly in accordance with the Prosecution Code.",
            "The Director's Overview of the \"Prosecutions Hong Kong 2019\" refutes allegations that the prosecution had been delinquent in prosecuting cases related to public order events. Responding to criticisms on the time taken for listing such cases for trials, it is pointed out that the prosecution, at the first hearing, would usually have to apply for an adjournment for further investigations by law enforcement agency. Similarly, most defendants, in exercising their rights, would also apply for time to consider the available evidence, seek proper legal representations and legal advice before taking plea. It is therefore common that there would be a period of time - months usually - in most of these cases before plea could be taken and a further period of time before commencement of trial.",
            "The \"Prosecutions Hong Kong 2019\" also gives an account of the continued effort of the DoJ in promoting public understanding of the criminal justice system and other tasks completed in 2019.",

            "律政司一直高度重視履行刑事檢控工作的憲制職務，不受任何干涉。檢控決定應該是基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析，並嚴格按照《檢控守則》而作出。",
            "《香港刑事檢控2019》的刑事檢控專員序言中反駁有關公眾秩序活動案件的檢控進展未如理想的指控。就公眾秩序活動案件排期審訊進度的批評，執法機關通常需要進行更進一步的調查，因此控方會在首度聆訊內申請押後法律程序。同樣地，大部分被告會行使權利，申請給予時間在答辯前考慮所得證據和尋求合適的法律代表及法律意見。因此，就大部分公眾秩序活動案件而言，首度聆訊後通常要過一段時間（往往以數月計）才進入答辯程序，然後再過一段時間才展開審訊。",
            "《香港刑事檢控2019》亦敍述了律政司在二○一九年繼續努力不懈加深公眾對刑事司法體系的認識，以及其他同年完成的項目。2020年12月31日（星期四）"
