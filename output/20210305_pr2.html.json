            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) today (March 5) issued the following statement setting out the general principles, without commenting on the proceedings of an ongoing case, in the handling of prosecutions:",
            "In respect of an application for review of admission to bail lodged by the DoJ yesterday (March 4), it should be noted that the case in question involves application for bail under Article 42(2) of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (National Security Law). The Court of Final Appeal delivered a judgment on February 9 on how to apply the granting of bail to a person charged with an offence under the National Security Law.",
            "According to section 9H of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap 221), the Secretary for Justice may apply to a judge (a judge means a Justice of Appeal, a judge of the Court of First Instance and a deputy judge of the Court of First Instance) to review the decision of admission to bail by a magistrate. Section 9J of the Ordinance provides that a person may also apply to a judge to be admitted to bail if his or her bail application has been refused by a magistrate.",
            "In accordance with section 9I of the Ordinance, when the Secretary for Justice indicates that an application for a review of the decision of admission to bail would be lodged under section 9H, the magistrate shall upon application by the Secretary for Justice if the person so admitted is present, order that the person be detained in custody and be brought before a judge.",
            "In general, bail application is heard in chambers (open to public). However, section 9P of the Ordinance shall be observed when making reports of bail proceedings. Section 9P(2) sets out that a report of bail proceedings may contain:",
            "(a) the name of the person being the subject of those proceedings;",
            "(b) the offence with which the person being the subject of those proceedings is charged;",
            "(c) the identity of the court and the name of the magistrate, District Judge or judge, as the case may be;",
            "(d) the names of counsel and solicitors, if any, engaged in the bail proceedings;",
            "(e) the result of the bail proceedings and where the person being the subject of those proceedings is admitted to bail subject to any condition under section 9D(2), the details of any such condition;",
            "(f) where the bail proceedings are adjourned, the date and place to which they are adjourned.",
            "In general, arrested persons are required to be brought up before a magistrate as soon as practicable after they have been charged and detained. The presiding magistrate would have to deal with the issue of bail and to settle the upcoming course of the proceedings. In an event that defendants are prosecuted under the same case, it has to be presided over by the same magistrate in accordance with the procedure.",
            "The DoJ will not tolerate the malicious attacks on the decision which was made in accordance the law, adding that members of the public should refrain from commenting on any case in which the legal proceedings are still ongoing.",

            "律政司今日（三月五日）發表以下聲明指出檢控程序的一般原則，聲明並沒有對尚在進行司法程序的案件加以評論：",
            "有關律政司昨日（三月四日）就保釋決定提出的覆核申請，該案件是涉及《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》（《香港國安法》）第四十二條第二款的保釋申請。終審法院在二月九日就如何適用被控違反《香港國安法》人士的保釋申請已作出裁決。",
            "根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）（《條例》）第9H條，律政司司長可向法官（法官指上訴法庭法官、原訟法庭法官及原訟法庭暫委法官）申請覆核裁判官准予保釋的決定；而《條例》第9J條指出，若裁判官拒絕准予某人保釋，該人亦可向法官提出保釋申請。",
            "按照《條例》第9I條，當律政司司長述明擬根據第9H條申請覆核裁判官准予保釋的決定，則在律政司司長提出申請時，如獲准保釋的人士在場，裁判官須命令將該人羈留扣押並帶到法官席前。",
            "一般而言，保釋申請屬內庭聆訊（公開），但報道保釋法律程序時必須遵守《條例》第9P條。第9P條第（2）款列明保釋法律程序的報道可載有：",
            "（a）是該等法律程序的標的之人的姓名；",
            "（b）是該等法律程序的標的之人所被控告的罪行；",
            "（c）法庭的名稱，以及裁判官、區域法院法官或法官的姓名（視屬何情況而定）；",
            "（d）在保釋法律程序中受聘的大律師及律師的姓名（如有的話）；",
            "（e）保釋法律程序的結果及（如是該等法律程序的標的之人獲准保釋但須受第9D（2）條所指的任何條件規限）任何該等條件的詳情；",
            "（f）（凡保釋法律程序被押後）押後至何日及何地。",
            "一般而言，被捕者被落案起訴和拘留後，必須在切實可行的情況下盡快出席聆訊。審理的裁判官需要處理保釋事宜和即將進行的訴訟程序。若被告人在同一宗案件被起訴，按程序必須由同一位裁判官審理。",
            "對於有人惡意攻擊律政司依法執行的決定，律政司表示有關行徑絕不能接受，同時亦提醒社會人士不適宜評論司法程序尚在進行的案件。",
