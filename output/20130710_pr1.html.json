            "Acting President,",
            "The Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2013 I introduced into the Legislative Council in April and the issues involved have been examined carefully by the Bills Committee chaired by Dr Hon Priscilla Leung. I am most grateful to her and the members of the Bills Committee for their helpful contributions.",
            "As I pointed out when introducing the Bill into this Council, the Bill seeks to amend the current Arbitration Ordinance (the Ordinance) in view of the new developments in the arbitration regime and the relevant matters. The Bill introduces a statutory mechanism for the enforcement of arbitral awards made in Macao by Hong Kong courts in order to implement the Arrangement Concerning Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards concluded with Macao in January 2013.",
            "Besides that, amendments are proposed to make it clear that emergency relief granted by an emergency arbitrator before the constitution of an arbitral tribunal is enforceable. Furthermore, it will be provided that if the costs of the arbitral proceedings are to be taxed by the court, they shall be taxed on a \"party to party\" basis. Under the Bill, the new parties (Note) to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (which is also known as the New York Convention) will be added to the Schedule to the Arbitration (Parties to New York Convention) Order.",
            "Under the Bill, consequential amendments will be made to the Rules of the High Court and technical amendments to some current sections of the Ordinance to make those sections more easily comprehensible.",
            "I will be moving some Committee Stage Amendments (CSAs) later. The CSAs have all been agreed by the Bills Committee. I will briefly outline the CSAs.",
            "Commencement of the Bill (Clause 1 of the Bill)",
            "We propose to amend clause 1 of the Bill to provide for a two stage commencement of the Bill. As regards the Arrangement concluded between Hong Kong and Macao, we are holding discussions with the Macao authorities on the implementation timetable. The pertinent provisions of the Bill will come into operation on a day to be appointed by notice published in the Gazette. As for other provisions, they will come into operation on the day of gazettal of the Bill upon enactment by this Council.",
            "Clauses 4, 5 (Chinese text of the Bill) and 20",
            "We propose to amend clause 4 of the Bill to make it clear that the new Part 3A will also apply to arbitration conducted in a place outside Hong Kong. We also propose very minor amendments to the Chinese text of clause 5 and clause 20. Since they were presented to the Bills Committee, I will not go over them one by one again here.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Acting President, as I mentioned when the Bill was introduced into this Council, the Bill, when enacted, will help reinforce Hong Kong's position as a leading international arbitration centre in Asia Pacific. We believe that the arbitration regime of Hong Kong will be further improved by the proposed amendments.",
            "With these remarks, I urge Members to support the Second Reading of the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2013 and endorse the amendments proposed by the Administration at the subsequent Committee Stage.",
            "Note: The new parties are Fiji, Liechtenstein, Sao Tome and Principe and Tajikistan.",

            "代主席：",
            "我在今年四月向立法會提交《2013年仲裁（修訂）條例草案》。由梁美芬議員擔任主席的法案委員會已小心審議《條例草案》和涉及的問題。我謹在此衷心感謝梁美芬議員及各委員的寶貴意見。",
            "正如我在向本會提交《條例草案》時指出，《條例草案》旨在因應仲裁機制及相關事宜的新發展修訂現行的《仲裁條例》。為了落實在二○一三年一月與澳門簽訂的《關於香港特別行政區與澳門特別行政區相互認可和執行仲裁裁決的安排》，《條例草案》就香港法院強制執行在澳門作出的仲裁裁決，引進法定機制。",
            "《條例草案》亦建議修訂，以清楚訂明緊急仲裁員在仲裁庭組成前所作出的緊急濟助，可得到強制執行；此外，《條例草案》訂明，若仲裁程序的費用由法院評定，法院須按「訴訟各方對評」基準評定有關的費用。一九五八年《承認及執行外國仲裁裁決公約》（又稱《紐約公約》）新增了新的締約方（註），《條例草案》會把這些新增的締約方納入《仲裁（紐約公約締約方）令》的附表。",
            "《條例草案》亦會對《高等法院規則》作出相應修訂，並對《仲裁條例》某些現行條文作出技術性的修訂，務求令該等條文更容易理解。",
            "稍後我會動議數項委員會審議階段修正案。這些修正案全部均獲法案委員會同意，我現在稍作介紹。",
            "《條例草案》的生效日期（《條例草案》第１條）",
            "首先，我們建議修訂《條例草案》第１條，使《條例草案》可以分兩階段實施。關於港澳兩地簽訂的《安排》，我們正與澳門當局商討落實的時間表，《條例草案》中與此相關的條文，我們會以憲報公告指定其生效日期。至於其他條文，則會在《條例草案》獲立法會通過後在刊憲當天生效。",
            "《條例草案》第4條、第5條中文本及第20條",
            "此外，我們建議修訂《條例草案》第4條，以便清晰訂明新增的第3A部也適用於香港以外地方進行的仲裁。我們亦建議對《條例草案》第5條中文本及第20條作出非常輕微的修訂，並已向法案委員會介紹，我在此不再逐一詳述。",
            "結語",
            "代主席，正如我在向本會提交《條例草案》時提到，《條例草案》獲得通過後，將有助鞏固香港作為亞太區主要國際仲裁中心的地位。我們相信建議修訂可進一步完善香港的仲裁制度。",
            "我謹此陳辭，懇請各位議員支持二讀《2013年仲裁（修訂）條例草案》，並在隨後的委員會審議階段通過當局提出的修正案。",
