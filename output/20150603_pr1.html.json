            "Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council today (June 3):",
            "Question:",
            "It is an established practice for the Department of Justice (DoJ) to brief out some of the criminal and civil cases, when there is a need for expert assistance where the requisite skill is not available in DoJ, or when there is no suitable in-house counsel to appear in court for the Government. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the respective number of cases, among the civil cases briefed out by DoJ in 2014, handled by the top 50 counsels;",
            "(2) of the total number of civil cases briefed out by DoJ in the past three years, with a breakdown by sets of chambers;",
            "(3) of the total number of counsels engaged by DoJ in civil cases briefed out in the past three years and, among them, the respective percentages of the counsels who had and had not been previously engaged; and",
            "(4) given that one of the stated objectives of DoJ's policy to brief out cases is to promote a strong and independent local Bar, particularly to the junior Bar, whether DoJ will consider briefing out civil cases to a greater diversity of junior counsels in different sets of chambers; if it will, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The DoJ has been briefing out certain criminal and civil cases, according to fee schedules approved by the Finance Committee, or at negotiated fees in specified circumstances. Briefing out is mainly to meet operational needs. Generally speaking, the DoJ may resort to briefing out when:",
            "(i) there is a need for expert assistance where the requisite skill is not available in the DoJ;",
            "(ii) there is no suitable in-house counsel to appear in court for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;",
            "(iii) there is a need for advice or proceedings involving members of the DoJ;",
            "(iv) there is a need for continuity or economy when handling a case;",
            "(v) as a matter of prudence, it is deemed appropriate to obtain independent outside counsel's advice or services so as to address possible perception of bias or issues of conflict of interest; and",
            "(vi) the size, complexity, quantum and length of a case so dictate.",
            "Further, where appropriate, some criminal cases are briefed out with the objective, among others, of promoting a strong and independent local Bar by providing work, particularly to the junior Bar, and of securing a pool of experienced prosecutors to supplement those within the DoJ. This practice is also intended to help change the commonly-held perception that all prosecutors must be government lawyers whereas the private Bar can represent only the defence in criminal cases.",
            "As regards the handling of civil cases, the selection of briefed out counsel will be made in accordance with established internal guidelines on briefing out so as to ensure propriety of the process and avoid any possible favouritism. The selection criteria include the briefed out counsel's years of experience and suitability in terms of areas of expertise and availability for the case concerned. The level of fees charged by the briefed out counsel is also one of the factors to be taken into account, since public money is involved.",
            "The DoJ's reply to the four-part question raised by the Hon Dennis Kwok is as follows:",
            "(1) In 2014, there were a total of 203 civil cases briefed out to outside counsel. The respective ranges of number of cases handled by individual briefed out counsel are as follows:",
            "(2) In the past three years (i.e. 2012 to 2014), a total of 763 civil cases were briefed out to outside counsel. Unless under special circumstances (e.g. the engagement of a junior counsel for a selected senior counsel in the same chambers for better work efficiency where the circumstances so required), the chambers to which a counsel belongs is not one of the considerations of selecting a briefed out counsel. Instead, as stated above, the selection criteria include the relevant counsel's years of experience, suitability in terms of areas of expertise, availability and level of fees. As such, we do not keep separate records on the sets of chambers involved.",
            "(3) A total of 140 counsel were engaged by the DoJ in the 763 civil cases briefed out in the past three years as mentioned above. About 80 per cent of the counsel concerned had previously been engaged whilst the remaining 20 per cent had not been previously engaged.",
            "(4) We repeat the selection criteria stated above when briefing out civil cases. Where appropriate, we will allow junior counsel to participate in our handling of civil cases. As stated above, the chambers to which a counsel belongs is generally not one of the considerations of selecting a briefed out counsel. Besides, whilst we support the promotion of a strong and independent local Bar, such a factor is not and cannot be the sole factor when briefing out civil cases.",

            "以下是今日（六月三日）在立法會會議上郭榮鏗議員的提問及律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "按照既定的做法，如律政司需要專家協助而司內並無所需人才，或司內並無合適的大律師可代表政府出庭，律政司會外判部分刑事和民事案件。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）律政司在二○一四年外判的民事案件當中，首五十名大律師所分別處理的案件數目；",
            "（二）律政司在過去三年外判的民事案件總數，並按大律師事務所列出分項數字；",
            "（三）律政司在過去三年就外判的民事案件委聘的大律師總數，以及在他們當中，以往曾獲委聘及從未獲委聘的大律師的百分比分別為何；及",
            "（四）鑑於律政司外判案件政策所述明的其中一個目標，是在本港建立一支強大而獨立的大律師隊伍，特別是為年資較淺的大律師提供實務機會，律政司會否考慮把民事案件外判予更多來自不同大律師事務所的大律師副手；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "一直以來，律政司都是根據財務委員會核准的收費表，或在特定情況下以議定的費用把若干刑事和民事案件外判。把案件外判主要是為了應付運作上的需要。一般來說，律政司會在下述情況下把案件外判：",
            "（一）需要專家協助，而司內並無所需人才；",
            "（二）司內並無合適的律師代表香港特別行政區出庭；",
            "（三）因涉及司內人員而需尋求法律意見或進行法律程序；",
            "（四）考慮到辦理有關案件時的連貫性問題或減低開支的需要；",
            "（五）為求審慎起見，認為適宜尋求獨立外間大律師提供法律意見或服務，以免可能予人有偏袒的觀感或出現利益衝突的問題；以及",
            "（六）基於案件的大小、複雜程度、申索量和所需時間而認為有需要把案件外判。",
            "此外，在適合的情況下外判部分刑事案件的其中一個目的，是為協助在本地建立一支強大而獨立的大律師隊伍，特別是為年資較淺的大律師提供實務經驗，以及培育一批經驗豐富的檢控人員，以輔助司內人員的工作。我們也希望藉此改變一般人的觀念，認為刑事案件的所有檢控人員必須是政府律師，而私人執業大律師則只可代表辯方出庭。",
            "在處理民事案件方面，我們會根據有關外判的內部既定指引甄選外判大律師，以確保過程恰當和避免任何偏好的可能。甄選準則包括外判大律師的執業年資、其專門知識範疇是否合適，以及外判大律師是否有空檔接辦該案。由於當中涉及動用公帑，外判大律師的收費水平也是考慮因素之一。",
            "本司現按郭榮鏗議員提出的四部分問題回覆如下︰",
            "（一）二○一四年外判予外間大律師處理的民事案件總數為２０３宗。各外判大律師處理的案件數目分布如下：",
            "（二）過去三年（即二○一二至二○一四年）外判予外間大律師處理的民事案件總數為７６３宗。除非情況特殊（例如因情況所需，為獲甄選的資深大律師委聘在同一大律師事務所內年資較淺的大律師出任副手，以令工作更具效率），否則外判大律師所屬的大律師事務所並非甄選外判大律師的考慮因素之一。甄選準則應如上文所述，包括相關外判大律師的執業年資、其專門知識範疇是否合適、是否有空檔接辦該案，以及收費水平。因此，我們沒有分開備存所涉大律師事務所的記錄。",
            "（三）就上文所述過去三年外判的７６３宗民事案件而言，律政司合共委聘１４０名大律師，其中約百分之八十的大律師過往曾獲委聘，餘下的百分之二十則從未獲委聘。",
            "（四）在外判民事案件時，我們會套用上述甄選準則。在適合的情況下，我們會讓年資較淺的大律師參與我們處理的民事案件。如上文所述，外判大律師所屬的大律師事務所一般並非甄選外判大律師的考慮因素之一。此外，雖然我們支持在本地建立一支強大而獨立的大律師隊伍，但我們外判民事案件時，這並非也不能是唯一考慮因素。",
