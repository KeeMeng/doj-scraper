            "In response to the press statement by the United States Department of State, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) made the following statement today (December 4):",
            "The baseless allegation that there is \"political persecution\" in Hong Kong is totally unsubstantiated and clearly made with an ulterior motive to interfere with China's internal affairs. Judges in Hong Kong are chosen only for their judicial and professional qualities. Unlike other places, they are not subjected to any political vetting. Our courts only decide cases in accordance with the law and evidence. No one can \"use\" our courts to achieve any other purpose. Judicial independence is guaranteed under Article 85 of the Basic Law which is practised and respected internationally. Such baseless allegations made against our Judiciary are strongly refuted.",
            "Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, including freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, are fully protected by the Basic Law and respected by the HKSAR Government. However, such freedoms are not absolute. Hong Kong's residents have been and will continue to be able to enjoy their legitimate rights and freedoms as guaranteed under the Basic Law.",
            "The individuals named in the statement by the United States are currently involved in cases in which the legal proceedings have not yet been completed. Suffice it to note that in so far as three of the individuals named are concerned, they pleaded guilty to the charges that had been laid against them. The Department of Justice is not in a position to comment any further on these cases at this stage as the matter is subjudice.",
            "The Judiciary will continue to exercise the judicial power including that of the final adjudication independently, free from any interference. Any statements made with an attempt to unduly influence the exercise of the judicial power in our legal system will be futile.",

            "香港特別行政區政府今日（十二月四日）發表以下聲明，以回應美國國務院的聲明：",
            "毫無根據地指稱香港存在「政治檢控」，顯然絕非事實並且別有用心，意圖干預中國內政。香港的法官只會根據其本人的司法和專業才能選用。有別於其他地方，他們並不受政治審查。我們的法院亦只依據法律和證據判案。沒有人可以利用法院達到其他目的。司法獨立受《基本法》第八十五條保障，並在國際上備受尊重。這些針對我們司法機構所作出的無理指控，須予以嚴正反駁。",
            "香港的人權和自由，包括言論自由和集會自由，獲《基本法》充分保障，亦受特區政府所尊重。然而，該等自由並非絕對。香港市民以往一直、並將繼續在《基本法》的保障下，依法享有權利和自由。",
            "美國該份聲明中提及的個別人士，目前涉及的案件尚未完成司法程序。被提及的三人已承認控罪。律政司現階段不會就此作進一步評論，以迴避待決案件。",
            "司法機構會繼續行使其獨立的司法權和終審權，不受任何干涉。企圖以聲明影響我們的司法系統行使司法權，必定徒勞無功。",
