            "The Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice today (December 30) released its annual report, \"Prosecutions in Hong Kong 2014\", which reviews the division's work and important cases last year.",
            "In his letter presenting the report to the Secretary for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, highlighted one of the most important guiding principles for all prosecutors: \"We, as ministers of justice, have an important role to play in maintaining a just criminal justice system.\"",
            "Mr Yeung said, \"Amongst other guiding principles, the prosecutorial independence conferred upon the Department of Justice by Article 63 of the Basic Law to control criminal prosecutions free from any interference - be it real or perceived, political or otherwise - will continue to be the principle that we will carefully guard and uphold for the good of Hong Kong.\"",
            "In the Director's Overview, Mr Yeung set out the key challenges that the Prosecutions Division faced during the year, and emphasised the importance of ensuring fairness and impartiality when handling them. For cases related to the \"Occupy Movement\", they have been, and will continue to be, handled with utmost fairness and impartiality, in strict accordance with the law and the division's core principles and values. In cases involving then serving or former officials, measures were taken to foster the public's confidence in the integrity and fairness of the prosecution service as a whole, and at the same time promote the notion of openness and accountability in the way the prosecuting authority approached its tasks.",
            "\"I will see to it that all of us in the division would continue to carry out our duties in the same fair and independent fashion and discharge our constitutional functions with utmost integrity, which is all the more important at times like the present,\" he said.",
            "During the year, the division also continued to take forward various measures to enhance the community's understanding of the rule of law and the criminal justice system generally, and more specifically the work of the division. Apart from the Prosecution Week covering various promotional activities which has been held on an annual basis since 2012, the division also took forward the Meeting the Community programme, which involved the delivery of talks by counsel in schools and other community organisations on a variety of topics related to the division's work. These two events will be the regular features of the division.",
            "The case-handling and public-oriented aspects of its work aside, the division also took forward various measures to keep its prosecutors abreast of the development of the criminal law and jurisprudence, both locally and on the international front.",
            "This latest review also contains two feature articles - one on \"Human rights consideration in the operation and reform of the hearsay rule in criminal proceedings\", and the other on \"To prosecute or not to prosecute - How do we decide sufficiency of evidence?\". For the former, Mrs Justice Maura McGowan of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales shared her views as to whether and to what extent the judgment of the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in Horncastle v United Kingdom [2014] ECHR 1394 (December 16, 2014) provides a relaxation in the admission of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings, and the human rights implications arising therefrom. For the latter, Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions (Acting) Mr Martin Hui, SC, and Public Prosecutor Miss Audrey Parwani jointly presented a detailed account as to how the prosecution authority in Hong Kong and those of other jurisdictions decide sufficiency of evidence in making their prosecutorial decisions.",

            "刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師在向律政司司長提交該年報的信件中，特別指出其中一項規範全體檢控人員的最重要原則。他說：「身為秉行公義者，我們在維持公正的刑事司法體系方面肩負重任。」",
            "他說︰「在眾多指導原則當中，《基本法》第六十三條訂明律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉──不論是在實質或觀感方面、又或是在政治或其他層面的干涉。為了香港的福祉，我們會繼續謹慎恪守這項原則。」",
            "楊家雄在年報的序言中敍述了刑事檢控科年內所面對的主要挑戰，並強調處理有關案件時確保公平和公正的重要性。就「佔領行動」，刑事檢控科一直、且會繼續秉持公正，不偏不倚，嚴格依據法律和基本原則及信念處理有關個案。至於涉及當時在職或前任政府官員的案件，刑事檢控科已採取措施以加強公眾對整體檢控工作公正無私的信心，同時讓公眾知悉檢控機關，在執行職務時力求開放和問責的理念。",
            "他說：「我會確保本科所有同事繼續同樣公平獨立、持正不阿地履行我們的憲制職能，這個處事方針在現時情況下尤其重要。」",
            "年內，刑事檢控科亦繼續推行不同措施，加深公眾對法治、刑事司法制度以及該科具體工作的了解。除自二○一二年開始舉辦的「檢控週」外（有關項目包括不同的活動），刑事檢控科亦推出「與公眾會面」計劃，由科內律師向學校及其他社區機構講解各項與該科工作有關的議題。這兩個項目會是刑事檢控科的常設活動。",
            "刑事檢控科除了處理案件和面對公眾外，也有推行不同措施，以令科內檢控人員能跟上本地和國際刑事法律的最新發展。",
            "此份最新年報亦包含兩篇專題特稿──一份為「探討刑事法律程序中傳聞證據規則的運作及改革所牽涉的人權問題」，而另一份為「檢控與否──如何決定證據是否充分？」。在前者中，英格蘭及威爾斯高等司法院法官Maura McGowan就歐洲人權法院在二○一四年十二月十六日就Horncastle v United Kingdom [2014] ECHR 1394案作出的裁決，是否和有多大程度放寬了在刑事程序中接納傳聞證據，及由此對人權有何影響，分享她的見解。而在後者中，署理副刑事檢控專員許紹鼎資深大律師及檢控官柏愛莉合作詳細闡述本港及其他司法管轄區的檢控機關如何在作出檢控決定時衡量證據是否充分。",
