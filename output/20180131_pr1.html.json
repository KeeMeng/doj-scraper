            "Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (January 31):",
            "Question:",
            "The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) handed down a judgment in May 2015 that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited was to hold as a trustee the late Ms Nina Kung's estate of tens of billions of dollars which was dedicated to charitable purposes. In response to the relevant questions I raised in June 2015 and February 2016, the former Secretary for Justice (SJ) said that as the protector of charities, he would actively follow up the arrangements for and the details of the implementation of Ms Kung's will and would eventually, as directed by the CFA, submit a scheme on using the estate for charitable purposes (the Scheme) to the Court for approval. He expected the Department of Justice (DoJ) to complete the formulation of the Scheme by around mid-2016. Before that, the estate would continue to be administered by the independent interim administrators appointed by the Court. However, the DoJ has not published the Scheme so far. Moreover, since the inauguration of the current-term Government, the former SJ resigned after serving for only six months; and his successor is embroiled in a scandal involving unauthorised building works found in her residence, and she has also been granted exceptional approval by the Chief Executive to continue with her handling of six ongoing arbitration cases and her teaching commitments concurrently, raising public concern whether she can handle official matters wholeheartedly in the near future. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether the DoJ has completed the formulation of the Scheme and submitted it to the Court; if so, when the DoJ submitted the Scheme; if not, of the reasons for that, and how much additional time the DoJ will need to finish the formulation of the Scheme, which commenced two and a half years ago; if the work cannot be finished shortly, whether the authorities have studied if SJ's performance in exercising the function as the protector of charities has highlighted the DoJ's lack of operational efficiency, falling short of public expectations and failure in fulfilling the last wish of Ms Kung;",
            "(2) given that the estate has all along been under the administration of accountants serving as the interim administrators since the aforesaid judgment was handed down by the CFA in May 2015, whether the authorities have assessed if the management fees charged by the accountants are reasonable and if Ms Kung's estate has been gnawed by the relevant expenses; and",
            "(3) whether it has assessed if public confidence in the Government's implementation of policies will be affected by the fact that Ms Kung's estate of tens of billions of dollars has not been put to charitable uses for a number of years?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Thank you for the Honourable Member's question. Mrs Nina Wang passed away in April 2007 leaving a home-made Chinese will dated July 28, 2002. In May 2012, the Secretary for Justice (SJ), as the protector of charity, commenced proceedings in the Court of First Instance seeking the Court's adjudication on the proper construction of the Will, in order to ensure proper management and ultimate distribution of the Estate.",
            "The Court of Final Appeal handed down its Judgment on May 18, 2015 and unanimously ruled that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (the Foundation) should hold the entire estate as a trustee and would not receive any part of the estate as an absolute gift.",
            "According to the Court of Final Appeal judgment, a scheme should be prepared and submitted to the High Court for approval after consultation between the Foundation and SJ as the protector of public charity.",
            "Following the Judgment of the Court of Final Appeal, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has been liaising with the Foundation through meetings and correspondence to exchange views on the preparation of the Scheme and related matters for administering the Estate. However, as parties had to work out the details of the arrangements for the establishment of a managing organisation to supervise the Foundation and the Chinese prize (an international prize and fund similar to the Nobel Prize), the parties had taken more time to consider the Scheme in detail. The DoJ had also sought advice from independent legal advice on the relevant legal issues. The scheme had been amended a few times, with the latest draft being drawn up in May 2017 and awaiting the Foundation's reply. During the relevant period, parties had discussed and sought directions from the Court in respect of the costs matter arising from the preparation of the scheme. As of now, the DoJ and the Foundation are still discussing the details of the latest draft Scheme, and we are still awaiting their substantive reply. It is estimated that some more time is required. We hope to reach further consensus with the Foundation in respect of the contents of the latest draft scheme as soon as possible. Once it is done, the DoJ will submit the draft Scheme to the Court. The DoJ is aware of the public's expectation to utilise the funds of the Estate for charitable purposes as soon as possible. In view of this, the DoJ has been actively working on the drafting of the Scheme as well as liaising with the Foundation accordingly, including to continue to explore the setting up of a supervising managing organisation jointly formed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Premier of the People's Republic of China Government as well as the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as intended in the Will. The DoJ will continue to closely monitor its progress. To ensure that the Scheme can be drafted and implemented as soon as possible and the Estate be administered in accordance with the testamentary intention of Mrs Wang, the DoJ will take timely actions as may be appropriate, including seeking guidance from the Court.",
            "Currently, the administration of the Estate is vested with the interim administrators appointed by the Court. The DoJ has also filed a caveat against a grant of probate or administration to preserve the status quo pending a scheme to be set up under the court's supervisory jurisdiction.",
            "The current interim administrators are professional accountants appointed by the Court. Their principal responsibilities are to get in and preserve the properties of the Estate, including making enquiries as they deem reasonably necessary or taking out legal proceedings to ensure that the Estate is properly preserved. Besides, the relevant work also includes handling matters arising from the operation of the Chinachem Group. As the Chinachem Group is a big business conglomerate comprising numerous companies with multiple areas of business, the relevant work activities can be very complicated. The interim administrators have been overseeing the Chinachem Group and made efforts to improve its governance structure, to ensure the smooth operation of various lines of corporate business. In discharge of their duties, the interim administrators would investigate and take follow-up actions against any irregularity known to them which might prejudice the proper preservation and management of the Estate. The interim administrators are also required to submit periodical reports to the Court, SJ and the Foundation on the conduct of the administration.",
            "Being \"officers of the Court\", the interim administrators owe a duty to the Court on matters relating to the interim administration of the Estate. The Court may also give directions to the interim administrators if and when necessary. The work of the interim administrators will continue to be monitored by the Court, including the consideration of the periodical reports and other relevant materials provided by them.",
            "The DoJ has, at all times, been paying close attention to the administration of the Estate and has been in frequent contact with the interim administrators, including considering the periodical reports provided by the interim administrators, approaching the interim administrators to further understand matters relating to the interim administration of the Estate, requesting the interim administrators to take follow-up actions and provide reports as the circumstances require, assisting the court in legal proceedings taken out by the interim administrators, and seeking directions from the court in the course of interim administration as may be required. The DoJ will continue to closely monitor the interim administrators' work in managing and preserving the Estate and the litigation involving the Chinachem Group and Foundation, and take such follow-up actions as may be appropriate.",
            "Regarding the fees of the independent interim administrators, they have been prescribed by the Court in the appointment order and are subject to the Court's scrutiny. The DoJ and the Foundation have also been monitoring the fees charged by the interim administrators. Should the DoJ and the Foundation consider the amount to be too high or unreasonable, an application may be made to the Court for taxation of the fees, in order to ensure that the interim administrators’ fees remain reasonable.",
            "As the protector of charity, SJ will actively follow up on the detailed arrangements for the implementation of the Will in light of the blueprint laid down in the Court of Final Appeal judgment, including continuing to keep in contact with the Foundation as the trustee of the Estate and to work closely with the interim administrators, discussing the follow-up actions required, closely monitor the management and preservation of the Estate of Mrs Nina Wang, and take such follow-up actions as may be appropriate, including the seeking of guidance from the court as may be required with a view to protecting and safeguarding the interest of the charity.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "以下是今日（一月三十一日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "終審法院於二○一五年五月裁定，華懋慈善基金有限公司是以受託人形式持有已故龔如心女士遺下作慈善用途的數百億元遺產。上任律政司司長在回應本人於二○一五年六月及二○一六年二月所提有關質詢時表示，他作為慈善事務守護人，會積極跟進龔女士的遺囑執行安排及細節，並最終按照終審法院的指示，提交有關如何運用該筆遺產作慈善用途的管理計劃（管理計劃）予法庭批准。他期望律政司可於大約二○一六年中完成制訂管理計劃。在此之前，該筆遺產將繼續由法庭委任的獨立臨時遺產管理人管理。然而，律政司至今仍未公布管理計劃。此外，本屆政府班子上任後，前任司長在任僅半年便辭任，而其繼任人因個人寓所僭建醜聞纏身，又獲行政長官破例批准同時繼續處理六宗仲裁個案及教學工作，引起公眾關注她於短期內能否全心全意處理公務。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）律政司是否已完成制訂並向法庭提交管理計劃；如是，何時提交；如否，原因為何，以及律政司還需要多久才完成已展開兩年半的制訂管理計劃工作；如未能於短期內完成，當局有否研究，司長行使其作為慈善事務守護人的職能的表現，是否凸顯律政司運作欠缺效率、有違社會大眾所託、有負龔女士遺願；",
            "（二）鑑於自終審法院於二○一五年五月頒下上述判決至今，該筆遺產一直由作為臨時遺產管理人的會計師管理，當局有否評估該會計師收取的管理費是否合理，以及有關開支有否蠶食龔女士的遺產；及",
            "（三）有否評估，龔女士數百億元遺產，多年來未能投入慈善用途，會否影響市民對政府施政的信心？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "多謝議員的提問，關於此事，龔如心女士於二○○七年四月去世時留下一份日期為二○○二年七月二十八日的自製中文遺囑。律政司於二○一二年五月以慈善事務守護人的身分在高等法院原訟法庭展開訴訟，就二○○二年遺囑條款的真確解釋向法庭尋求指示，以確定該筆遺產的適當管理及最終分配。",
            "終審法院於二○一五年五月十八日頒布判詞，一致裁定華懋慈善基金將以受託人的形式持有全部遺產，而不是以無條件饋贈的形式接收有關遺產的任何部分。",
            "根據終審法院的判決，華懋慈善基金及律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人就計劃作出商討後，須擬備計劃並提交高等法院作批核。",
            "隨着終審法院的判決，律政司一直與華懋慈善基金就擬備遺產的管理計劃及有關事項保持聯繫，通過會議及書信往來，就管理計劃的細節及相關事宜交換了意見。但由於制定計劃牽涉很多法律的多方面問題，包括成立管理機構以監管華懋慈善基金作為受託人的事宜，以及制訂有關設立一個類似諾貝爾世界性的獎金和基金的中國獎的安排，牽涉一些瑣碎的細節需要商討，雙方需要較長的時間研究相關問題。律政司亦就有關的法律議題徵詢過獨立的法律意見。該計劃經過多番修改，最新的草擬本於二○一七年五月備妥，亦交予華懋慈善基金，有待回應。其間，雙方曾就擬備遺產管理計劃的法律費用商討過，最後亦向法庭尋求指示。至目前為止，律政司與華懋慈善基金就該最新的草擬本的內容及細節仍在進行商討，我們仍在等候他們一些實體性的回覆，估計仍需一些時間，但期望能盡快與華懋慈善基金達成共識。律政司會在管理計劃有定案後，向法庭提交計劃，讓他們審批。律政司理解社會大眾期望該筆遺產可以盡快投入慈善用途，因此律政司一直積極進行有關草擬工作並與華懋慈善基金進行商討，包括繼續探討成立遺囑中所希望由聯合國秘書長、中國政府總理和香港特區行政首長組成的管理機構。律政司會繼續密切監察進度及適時採取必要行動，包括在有需要時向法庭尋求指示，以確保能盡快擬定及執行管理計劃，按龔女士的遺願處理有關遺產。",
            "現時，該筆遺產的管理權交予法庭所委任的臨時管理人。律政司亦已於遺產承辦處存檔知會備忘，以確保遺產維持現狀，直至法庭核准管理計劃成立。",
            "現時的臨時遺產管理人是由法庭任命的專業會計師，他們的主要職責是查明和保護龔如心女士遺產下的財產，包括作出合理及必要的查詢或開展相關法律程序，以確保該筆遺產得以妥善保存。有關工作亦包括處理華懋集團營運上的相關事宜。鑑於華懋集團的規模龐大，集團旗下的眾多公司涉足不同範疇的業務，相關工作十分繁複。臨時遺產管理人亦一直致力改善集團管治架構，確保各項公司業務得以運作暢順。在其職責範圍內，臨時遺產管理人會調查及跟進其知悉的任何有損該筆遺產的妥善保存和運用的不當行為，亦須定期向法庭、律政司及華懋慈善基金遞交報告，交代遺產管理的情況。",
            "作為「法院人員」（officer of the court），臨時遺產管理人須就遺產管理事宜向法庭負責，而法庭亦有權在有需要時向臨時遺產管理人頒布指令。臨時遺產管理人的工作一直受法庭監管，包括審閱其定期提交的報告和其他相關資料。",
            "一直以來，律政司也有密切關注該筆遺產的管理狀況及與臨時遺產管理人保持緊密聯繫，包括審閱臨時遺產管理人的定期報告、進一步向臨時遺產管理人了解相關事宜、按情況及需要要求臨時遺產管理人作出跟進和匯報、協助法庭處理臨時遺產管理人在過程中提出的法律程序，以及在有需要時就該筆遺產的臨時遺產管理事宜向法庭尋求指示。律政司會繼續密切關注臨時遺產管理人就該筆遺產的管理和保存的工作，以及牽涉華懋集團及華懋慈善基金的法律訴訟，並在有需要時作出適當的跟進。",
            "有關獨立臨時遺產管理人收取的費用，在法庭的委任命令經已有所規定，並受法庭的監督。律政司及華懋慈善基金亦有一直審閱臨時遺產管理人的收費，倘雙方認為某筆費用過高或不合理，可向法庭提出申請，要求評定有關費用，以確保臨時遺產管理人的費用維持在合理的水平。",
            "律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，會根據終審法院就遺囑管理計劃設定的藍圖，繼續積極跟進實施遺囑内容的具體安排，包括與作爲遺產受托人的華懋慈善基金保持聯繫、與臨時遺產管理人緊密合作、討論所需要的後續行動，繼續密切留意龔如心女士遺產的管理和保存，並在有需要時作出跟進，包括尋求法庭指示，以維護及保障相關的慈善利益。",

            "終審法院於二○一五年五月十八日頒布判詞，一致裁定華懋慈善基金將以受託人的形式持有全部遺產，而不是以無條件饋贈的形式接收有關遺產的任何部分",
            "根據終審法院的判決，華懋慈善基金及律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人就計劃作出商討後，須擬備計劃並提交高等法院作批核",
            "隨着終審法院的判決，律政司一直與華懋慈善基金就擬備遺產的管理計劃及有關事項保持聯繫，通過會議及書信往來，就管理計劃的細節及相關事宜交換了意見",
            "但由於制定計劃牽涉很多法律的多方面問題，包括成立管理機構以監管華懋慈善基金作為受託人的事宜，以及制訂有關設立一個類似諾貝爾世界性的獎金和基金的中國獎的安排，牽涉一些瑣碎的細節需要商討，雙方需要較長的時間研究相關問題",
            "律政司亦就有關的法律議題徵詢過獨立的法律意見",
            "該計劃經過多番修改，最新的草擬本於二○一七年五月備妥，亦交予華懋慈善基金，有待回應",
            "其間，雙方曾就擬備遺產管理計劃的法律費用商討過，最後亦向法庭尋求指示",
            "至目前為止，律政司與華懋慈善基金就該最新的草擬本的內容及細節仍在進行商討，我們仍在等候他們一些實體性的回覆，估計仍需一些時間，但期望能盡快與華懋慈善基金達成共識",
            "律政司會在管理計劃有定案後，向法庭提交計劃，讓他們審批",
            "律政司理解社會大眾期望該筆遺產可以盡快投入慈善用途，因此律政司一直積極進行有關草擬工作並與華懋慈善基金進行商討，包括繼續探討成立遺囑中所希望由聯合國秘書長、中國政府總理和香港特區行政首長組成的管理機構",
            "律政司會繼續密切監察進度及適時採取必要行動，包括在有需要時向法庭尋求指示，以確保能盡快擬定及執行管理計劃，按龔女士的遺願處理有關遺產",
            "現時，該筆遺產的管理權交予法庭所委任的臨時管理人",
            "律政司亦已於遺產承辦處存檔知會備忘，以確保遺產維持現狀，直至法庭核准管理計劃成立",
            "現時的臨時遺產管理人是由法庭任命的專業會計師，他們的主要職責是查明和保護龔如心女士遺產下的財產，包括作出合理及必要的查詢或開展相關法律程序，以確保該筆遺產得以妥善保存",
            "有關工作亦包括處理華懋集團營運上的相關事宜",
            "鑑於華懋集團的規模龐大，集團旗下的眾多公司涉足不同範疇的業務，相關工作十分繁複",
            "臨時遺產管理人亦一直致力改善集團管治架構，確保各項公司業務得以運作暢順",
            "在其職責範圍內，臨時遺產管理人會調查及跟進其知悉的任何有損該筆遺產的妥善保存和運用的不當行為，亦須定期向法庭、律政司及華懋慈善基金遞交報告，交代遺產管理的情況",
            "臨時遺產管理人的工作一直受法庭監管，包括審閱其定期提交的報告和其他相關資料",
            "一直以來，律政司也有密切關注該筆遺產的管理狀況及與臨時遺產管理人保持緊密聯繫，包括審閱臨時遺產管理人的定期報告、進一步向臨時遺產管理人了解相關事宜、按情況及需要要求臨時遺產管理人作出跟進和匯報、協助法庭處理臨時遺產管理人在過程中提出的法律程序，以及在有需要時就該筆遺產的臨時遺產管理事宜向法庭尋求指示",
            "律政司會繼續密切關注臨時遺產管理人就該筆遺產的管理和保存的工作，以及牽涉華懋集團及華懋慈善基金的法律訴訟，並在有需要時作出適當的跟進",
            "有關獨立臨時遺產管理人收取的費用，在法庭的委任命令經已有所規定，並受法庭的監督",
            "律政司及華懋慈善基金亦有一直審閱臨時遺產管理人的收費，倘雙方認為某筆費用過高或不合理，可向法庭提出申請，要求評定有關費用，以確保臨時遺產管理人的費用維持在合理的水平",
            "律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，會根據終審法院就遺囑管理計劃設定的藍圖，繼續積極跟進實施遺囑内容的具體安排，包括與作爲遺產受托人的華懋慈善基金保持聯繫、與臨時遺產管理人緊密合作、討論所需要的後續行動，繼續密切留意龔如心女士遺產的管理和保存，並在有需要時作出跟進，包括尋求法庭指示，以維護及保障相關的慈善利益",
