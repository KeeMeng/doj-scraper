            "Following is the speech by the Solicitor General, Mr Frank Poon, at the 1st (2013/2014) Law Reform Essay Competition Certificate Award Ceremony today (June 30):",
            "Chief Justice, Members of the Law Reform Commission (LRC), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:",
            "First of all, on behalf of the Law Reform Commission, may I extend our warmest welcome to all of you here.",
            "The idea of organising a law reform essay competition in Hong Kong was first put to us by one of our Executive Council Members, the Honourable Ms Anna Wu. Although Ms Wu cannot join us this evening as she is not in town, I would like to thank her for raising the idea with us and also her subsequent contribution which I will mention later.",
            "When the idea of this competition was discussed at the LRC meeting, LRC members were all very supportive. Eventually, the LRC decided last year to organise, for the first time, an essay competition that provides law students in Hong Kong with an opportunity to propose how a given area of Hong Kong law may be reformed.",
            "As the Chairman of the LRC has said on many occasions, law reform plays an important role in any community which aspires to maintain the rule of law. We live in a fast changing world. Globalisation, advance of technology and other forces make our world changes even faster than before. As our society evolves, our laws have to change so as to meet the needs of our society. Indeed, unless our laws are kept up to date, the risk of injustice and unfairness may emerge.",
            "The LRC believes that this essay competition would, amongst others, assist in raising law students' awareness and interests in law reform, as well as offering them an opportunity to reflect on and suggest proposals on what the law should be on a given topic (in contrast with simply studying what the law is).",
            "The topic chosen for the competition is: \"Should pre-nuptial agreements be recognised and enforceable in Hong Kong? If so, how?\". Winners are awarded with a one-month attachment with leading law firms and the Department of Justice. I would like to express our gratitude to the four sponsoring law firms for their support in offering an internship to the finalists. Their support is instrumental in making this competition a success. These four law firms are Baker & McKenzie, ONC Lawyers, Wilkinson & Grist and Woo Kwan Lee & Lo. In this regard, I should also thank Ms Anna Wu, Ms Angela Lee and Mr Ludwig Ng as they played an important role in assisting us to obtain sponsorship from the four law firms. I am very happy that representatives from these law firms can join us this evening. In addition, Mr Ludwig Ng from ONC Lawyers, a strong supporter of law reform, will also share with us his thoughts on the competition in a moment.",
            "Apart from the people and law firms which I have expressed gratitude to, I would also like to thank the four universities, namely, the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the City University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Shue Yan University. Without their assistance in disseminating information to their students and encouraging them to participate, this competition would not have been a success.",
            "In this competition, 41 essays were received. Thirteen essays were shortlisted for the second marking and the five finalists were eventually chosen after very careful assessment by our Adjudicating Panel comprising Mr John Budge (who is the Chairman of the Panel), Professor Lin Feng, Mr Peter Rhodes, Mr Paul Wan (the Law Draftsman of the Department of Justice) and Professor Michael Wilkinson. We are most grateful to the members of the Panel for their time and effort in considering and assessing the essays.",
            "As regards the five finalists, I would like to congratulate them for their well-argued and thoroughly researched essays. LRC members unanimously consider that the five essays are of a very high standard both in terms of substance and presentation. I have no doubt that they must have spent a lot of time and effort before they could come up with such excellent essays. Should you like to read the essays, they are available on the LRC's website.",
            "Lastly, I would like to do a bit of marketing. Encouraged by the result of this first essay competition, the LRC has decided to make this law reform essay competition an annual event. Details of the second competition will be announced in due course and I hope the LRC can continue to count on your support in the years to come.",
            "On this note, may I wish the finalists every success in their studies and future career in the legal profession. Thank you and I wish you all an enjoyable evening.",

            "以下是法律政策專員潘英光今日（六月三十日）出席首屆（2013－2014年度）法律改革徵文比賽獎狀頒發典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位法律改革委員會成員、各位來賓、各位先生、各位女士：",
            "首先，我謹代表法律改革委員會（法改會），熱烈歡迎大家出席這個頒獎典禮。",
            "在香港舉辦法律改革徵文比賽這個構思，最初是由行政會議成員胡紅玉女士向我們提出。雖然胡女士今天因不在港而未克出席，但我仍要多謝她向我們提出這個建議，亦要多謝她其後所作的貢獻，稍後我會再加闡述。",
            "當這項比賽的構思在法改會會議上討論時，全體成員都表示十分支持。法改會於是決定首度舉辦徵文比賽，讓香港的法律學生有機會就香港法律的某個特定範疇提出改革建議。",
            "正如法改會主席曾在很多場合說過，在任何矢志維護法治的社會，法律改革發揮重要作用。我們生活在一個轉變迅速的世界，全球化、科技發展以至其他各種因素，令到世界改變之快超越往昔。隨着社會持續發展，我們的法律亦必須改變，以切合社會的需要。事實上，除非我們的法律與時並進，否則便有可能出現不公義和不公平的情況。",
            "法改會相信，這項徵文比賽能達致多項目的，包括有助提高法律學生對法律改革的認知和興趣，讓法律學生有機會就某個特定的課題，思考和提出使法律「更臻完善」的建議（有別於僅僅研習法律的「現行規定」）。",
            "這次徵文比賽的題目是：「婚前協議應否在香港獲得承認和強制執行？如屬肯定，則應如何施行？」得獎者可分別獲派往香港的知名律師事務所及律政司實習，為期一個月。我謹向提供贊助的四間律師事務所表達我們的謝意，感謝他們鼎力支持，向得獎者提供實習機會。他們的支持至為重要，使到這項比賽能夠舉辦成功。這四間律師事務所分別是：貝克．麥堅時律師事務所、柯伍陳律師事務所、高露雲律師行及胡關李羅律師行。我亦要藉此機會多謝胡紅玉女士、李慧賢女士和伍兆榮先生。上述四間律師事務所同意提供贊助，實有賴他們幾位的襄助。我十分高興，這四間律師事務所今晚均有代表出席。此外，柯伍陳律師事務所的伍兆榮律師，本身是法律改革的積極支持者，他稍後更會與大家分享關於比賽的感想。",
            "除了感謝上述人士和律師事務所之外，我亦要向四間大學，即香港大學、香港中文大學、香港城市大學及香港樹仁大學，致以謝忱。校方幫忙把比賽資訊發送給學生並鼓勵他們參賽，假如沒有得到校方的協助，比賽實難以成功舉辦。",
            "在這次比賽中，我們一共收到41篇文章。經初選後有13篇文章入圍，須作第二輪評分，而評審委員會經多番詳細考慮後，最終評選出五名得獎者。評審委員會的成員分別是：白仲安先生（評審委員會主席）、林峰教授、羅德士先生、尹效良先生（律政司法律草擬專員）及韋健生教授。他們抽空評閱參賽文章，費盡心思，我們為此萬分感謝。",
            "至於五名得獎者，他們的參賽文章都是說理明晰、研究透徹的佳作，我在此恭賀他們得獎。法改會各成員都一致認為，得獎的文章無論在內容和表達方面，都有很高的水準。毫無疑問，他們都是經過不少時間的思考琢磨，才能寫就如此優秀的作品。大家如有興趣一讀這些優勝作品，可以登入法改會網站。",
            "最後，讓我賣賣廣告。由於得到首屆徵文比賽成績的鼓舞，法改會決定再接再厲，以後每年都會舉辦這項法律改革徵文比賽。關於第二屆比賽的詳情，會稍後公布。我希望法改會在未來各屆能夠繼續得到大家的鼎力支持。",
            "我謹在此祝願五名得獎同學學業有成，日後在法律界前途光明。多謝各位，並祝大家有個愉快的晚上。",
