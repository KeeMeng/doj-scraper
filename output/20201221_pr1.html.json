            "The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) welcomed the judgment delivered by the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) today (December 21), which upheld the compatibility of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) with the Basic Law and the proportionality of the restrictions of rights in prohibiting the use of facial coverings at public order events contained in the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation (PFCR).",
            "The CFA acknowledged that the very nature of the ERO requires the giving of wide and flexible legislative powers to the executive to deal with emergencies or public dangers quickly and adequately. Given the situations concerned are one of emergency or public danger, it should be left to the judgment of the Chief Executive in Council to make regulations which she may consider desirable in the public interest. The Court also pointed out that such legislative powers are necessary in particular when the Legislative Council may not be able to function and respond promptly enough or at all to the occasion of emergency or public danger in terms of passing the requisite legislation.",
            "As to the PFCR, the CFA noted certain rights are affected by the prohibitions imposed by the PFCR but emphasised that the rights are not absolute and may be subject to lawful restrictions including the interests of public safety, public order and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.",
            "The CFA agreed that the preventative and deterrent nature of the PFCR is crucial and the need to prevent the deterioration of peaceful gatherings into violence is an integral part of the legitimate aim.",
            "The HKSAR Government fully echoed the views expressed by the CFA that, when striking a fair balance between the societal and individual interests, \"the interests of Hong Kong as a whole should be taken into account since the rule of law itself was being undermined by the actions of masked lawbreakers who, with their identities concealed, were seemingly free to act with impunity\".",

            "香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）歡迎終審法院今日（十二月二十一日）頒下的裁決，確立《緊急情況規例條例》（《緊急條例》）符合《基本法》，以及《禁止蒙面規例》禁止在公眾活動使用蒙面物品而限制相關權利是符合相稱性要求的。",
            "終審法院確認《緊急條例》在本質上需要賦予行政機關寬廣且具彈性的立法權力，以迅速及充分應對緊急或危害公安的情況。在緊急或危害公安的情況下，應交由行政長官會同行政會議在認為符合公眾利益時，就訂立規例作出決定。法院同時指出，授予該些立法權力實有需要，尤其當立法會未能及時甚至完全無法運作以對有關緊急或危害公安的情況作出回應並通過必需的法例。",
            "至於《禁止蒙面規例》，終審法院注意到一些權利受該規例所施加的限制影響，但強調此等權利並非絕對權利，而是可受到合法限制的，包括公眾安全、公共秩序，以及保障他人權利和自由方面。",
            "終審法院認同《禁止蒙面規例》的預防和阻嚇性質十分關鍵，而避免和平的公眾集結演變成暴力衝突是其正當目的之核心部分。",
            "特區政府完全同意終審法院指出，在尋求為社會利益和個人權利兩者之間取得公正的平衡時，需考慮香港的整體利益：蒙面違法者隱藏身分，以為不用受到法律制裁而作出違法行為，實屬對法治的損害。",
