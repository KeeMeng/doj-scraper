            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at a media session after attending the Legislative Council meeting today (December 16):",
            "Reporter: Do you think that clearing bias claim of the Magistrate yesterday could enhance public confidence towards the judicial system?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Judicial independence is the cornerstone of our society. It is a very important pillar of the rule of law. Therefore, by safeguarding judicial independence, it is not just the duty of any particular lawyer, but a duty of every single law-abiding citizen. The complaints that are made against the Magistrate have been dealt with by the Judiciary, and I believe they have explained clearly with the relevant evidence placed before the public why those complaints are dismissed. With that, I hope that the public as well as the local and international media will be able to appreciate that we do cherish and safeguard our esteemed judicial independence.",
            "Reporter: The Department of Justice is always refraining from commenting on ongoing proceedings, but we have seen recently a more outspoken approach from the department. Are you worried that this may give the perception that the Department of Justice may be holding a certain view before it approaches a matter?",
            "Secretary for Justice: That question seems to conflate a number of things. When a case is ongoing, it is a matter of basic important principles that people do not discuss about the case in the media when facts are only partially known. That is why we have a judicial system, and that is why the Department of Justice and indeed the other side should never comment on the case because of this principle of sub judice. One has to respect that the proceedings have to be continued. The Department of Justice has been, and I use the word \"outspoken\" as suggested by you, but the Department of Justice has a duty to come out and put the facts right when things are misreported either by the relevant media or misstated by the person who is making those statements. It is our duty to make sure that the facts are put right. We have been extremely cautious that we never comment on a particular case. Every time as you will gather, some of you may not particularly like the way I keep saying it, I cannot comment on the case but I will give you the general principles. What the Department of Justice and sometimes through myself as the Secretary for Justice have said on the general principles are perpetual truths, they are always correct. It is important that the general public hear them so that they can understand how they should be respecting the rule of law and joining hands with the Government as well as the legal profession to safeguard the rule of law.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（十二月十六日）出席立法會會議後，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "律政司司長：最近大家在本地或外國的媒體都見到很多針對我們的司法機構甚至司法人員的一些行為或言論。有些達到恐嚇成分，有些無理地要求立即釋放（被告）或撤控。這些言論若意圖或希望可以影響律政司進行檢控工作，或影響司法機構進行審判、行使司法獨立的審判權，和我們獨立的檢控權，這些意圖只會徒勞無功。我們絕不同意這些干涉的做法。",
            "社會絕對可以理性、客觀、根據事實討論判詞，但絕不可以攻擊司法人員，或作惡意的報道。在適當的情況下，律政司會發聲，我們亦會提醒市民必須尊重法治和司法獨立。每一個人均有責任——不僅是律政司，不僅是法律界——每個市民均有責任尊重和維護法治以及司法獨立。最近，英聯邦律師協會亦就早前一位法官受恐嚇發出聲明，指出如果司法機構被無理攻擊，政府機構和法律組織應該如何捍衞。我們非常同意此說法，因此，當司法系統遭受無理攻擊時，我希望兩個法律專業團體、律政司，以及所有市民，都會適時向社會大眾表明立場，維護司法獨立。多謝各位。",
            "記者：全國港澳研究會理事顧敏康今日在報章撰文，表示市民對一些法官抱有疑慮，建議將黎智英移交內地審訊。司長對此有何回應？",
            "律政司司長：這個問題正是我剛才所說，這案件已經進入司法程序，所以我不會作出任何回應。",
            "記者：司長，兩條問題。第一，司法機構受到攻擊都頗一段時間，之前也有法官質疑為何律政司沒有捍衞司法機構，現在這樣說會否有點遲？第二條問題是，之前英國半年報告都有討論過，到底英國是否要停止派法官來港擔任非常任法官，司長有否想過後果會是怎樣，或者有否討論對應措施？",
            "律政司司長：很多謝你的問題，因為可以讓我有機會講清楚。社會上任何人都可以客觀理性地討論案件的判詞。我希望社會不是單看結果——我喜歡這個結果就鼓掌，不喜歡這個結果就責罵——我們一定要看原因，所以在判詞中我們可以看到原因。社會上客觀理性地討論（案件判詞）絕對可以，即使我們做律師的也常常這樣做。不能夠做的是藉事件攻擊法官、攻擊司法制度或相關參與人士，這是法律所不容許的。當有人達至接近超越合理、法律容許的情況下發表意見，近乎好像最近的事件，特別明顯是一個恐嚇，作為律政司司長，我必然要出來。但不是每一次有人在文章、報刊發表意見時，律政司司長都要評論別人的意見。只要是合理、理性、客觀的討論，這是法律上所容許的。這是第一點。",
            "第二個問題是關於法官的事情。香港的《基本法》就司法制度有一個很鞏固的基礎，我們的司法獨立不是單憑口說，亦不是單靠《基本法》第八十五條訂明的保障。司法獨立是通過法官如何被委任、有關司法程序是否公開透明、法官的判詞是否有理有據、其原因是可以公開查閱，我們的司法獨立就這樣一步一步穩穩固固建立起來。當然我們很高興，在司法機構終審法院有非常任法官參與我們的司法工作。與其他地方不同，我們的非常任法官不僅審理民商事案件，憲制、刑事、任何案件至終審法院，他們都會參與，可以作出判決。這一點很清楚證明我們所建立的司法獨立機制是穩固的，我很希望外國知名法官繼續來香港參與我們的司法工作。多謝各位。",
