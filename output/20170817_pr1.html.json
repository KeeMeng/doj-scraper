            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) today (August 17) issues the following statement in respect of the Court of Appeal case concerning Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law (CAAR 4/2016):",
            "The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) all along respects the freedom of speech, and the right to demonstration, assembly, etc. However, one must also respect the law when exercising such rights, and should not over-step the boundary allowed under the law.",
            "The above-named three defendants in this case were convicted not because they exercised their civil liberties, but because their conduct during the protest contravened the law. The HKSAR courts have all along handled cases (including public order event cases) independently, justly and professionally. The court found the three defendants guilty on the basis of evidence presented during a fair trial as well as the applicable law. Although the defendants at one stage sought to appeal against their convictions, they have since withdrawn their appeals against conviction.",
            "Under the HKSAR's legal system, both the prosecution and the convicted defendant can seek an appeal of sentence to a higher court. An appeal of this nature by DoJ proceeds, with leave of the Court of Appeal, by way of an application for review of sentence in accordance with sections 81A and 81B of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, and will be considered by the Court of Appeal. However, under section 81C of the said Ordinance, if the defendants have already lodged an appeal against conviction, the Court of Appeal shall not review the sentence unless the appeal against conviction has been withdrawn or disposed of.",
            "In the present case, DoJ was granted leave by the Court of Appeal on October 12, 2016 to review the defendants' sentence. However, since the defendants had lodged appeals against their convictions in August 2016, DoJ's application for review could not be heard until after the defendants’ appeals against conviction have been dealt with. The defendants' appeals against conviction were scheduled for May 22, 2017. The court directed the defendants to file written submissions on or before April 20, 2017. The defendants eventually did not file any written submissions and withdrew their appeals the day before the said deadline (i.e. April 19, 2017).",
            "After the defendants withdrew their appeals against conviction, DoJ applied to fix a date for the hearing of its review of sentence. The review was heard by the Court of Appeal on August 9, 2017, and today the Court of Appeal delivered the judgment (Judgment). The Court of Appeal's Judgment clarifies the relevant legal principles and sentencing standards, and can provide guidance to future cases of similar nature.",
            "DoJ notices that certain people in the community allege that the prosecution in this case was politically motived, or that this case is a case of political persecution. Such kind of allegations are utterly groundless, and choose to ignore the existence of objective evidence. In all criminal cases (including this one), DoJ deals with them in accordance with the Prosecution Code, the applicable law and relevant evidence. Further, the state of judicial independence in the HKSAR cannot be doubted. It can be seen from the reasoning contained in the Judgment that the Court of Appeal dealt with this case solely from the legal perspective, and that there cannot be any suggestion of political motivation whatsoever. In this regard, DoJ draws the public's attention to paragraph 171 of the Judgment (which is in Chinese (Note) and which reads as follows):",
            "\"最後，本席重申，答辯人等不能說他們是因為行使集會、示威或言論自由而被定罪和判刑。……他們之所以被定罪和判刑，是因為他們僭越了法律的界線，以嚴重違法的手段，自己強行非法進入或煽惑他人，當中包括年輕人及學生，強行非法進入政總前地——一個當時他們和其他示威者在法律上都沒有權利可以進入的地方，而干犯了參與非法集結或煽惑他人參與非法集結。答辯人等也不能說，上訴法庭對他們處以的刑罰，壓縮了他們可依法行使示威、集會或言論自由的空間。只要他們在法律的界線內行事，法律會全面、充份地保障他們示威、集會和言論自由；但一旦他們僭越了法律的界線而違法，法律制裁他們並不是剝奪或打壓他們的示威、集會和言論自由，因為法律從來都絕不容許他們以違法的手段來行使那些自由。\"",
            "Note: The entire Judgment of the Court of Appeal is in Chinese. No official English translation is available at the time when this press release is issued.",

            "就今日（八月十七日）上訴法庭處理黃之鋒、羅冠聰和周永康一案 CAAR 4/2016，律政司發表以下聲明︰",
            "香港特區政府一直尊重言論、示威、集會等自由和權利。但行使該等權利時亦必須尊重法律，不應超越法律容許的界線。本案上述三名被告並非因為行使公民自由權利而被定罪，而是因為他們進行抗議時的行為觸犯法律。",
            "香港特區的法院一直獨立、公正和專業地處理案件（包括涉及公共秩序的案件）。就三名被告的案件，法庭是根據於公平審訊中呈堂的證據和適用法律，作出獨立判決，裁定他們罪成。雖然被告曾一度就裁決提出上訴，但最終他們撤回所有上訴。",
            "根據香港的法律制度，控方和被定罪者均可就刑期向上級法院提出上訴。律政司就刑期的上訴是依據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81A及81B條，在經上訴法庭許可下以覆核申請形式提出，並由上訴法庭處理。但根據該條例第81C條，如被告人已就所判處刑罰的定罪提出上訴，除非該上訴已撤回或獲處置，上訴法庭不得覆核刑罰。",
            "就本案而言，律政司在二○一六年十月十二日獲上訴法庭許可提出覆核，但由於被告於二○一六年八月就其定罪提出上訴，覆核申請當時暫不能進行，要到法院完成處理三名被告的定罪上訴才可處理律政司的刑期覆核申請。被告的上訴原排期於二○一七年五月二十二日聆訊，法庭並指示各被告須在二○一七年四月二十日或之前存檔書面陳詞。三名被告最終並無向法庭存檔其書面陳詞，並在限期前一日（即二○一七年四月十九日) 撤回其上訴。",
            "在被告撤回其上訴後，律政司申請就刑期覆核申請排期聆訊，在二○一七年八月九日於上訴法庭進行聆訊。上訴法庭於今日頒布判詞。上訴法庭的判案書釐清相關法律原則和量刑準則，能為日後同類案件提供指引。",
            "律政司留意到社會上有部分人士指本案的檢控有政治目的，甚或是政治迫害。此類指控全無基礎，更漠視本案客觀存在的證據。律政司只是依據《檢控守則》、適用法律和證據處理刑事案件（包括本案）。再者，香港特區司法獨立的情況不可能被質疑。從判案書的理據可看出，法院純以法律角度處理本案，不可能存在任何政治動機。在這方面，律政司希望大家留意判案書第171段以下的解說︰",
            "「最後，本席重申，答辯人等不能說他們是因為行使集會、示威或言論自由而被定罪和判刑。……他們之所以被定罪和判刑，是因為他們僭越了法律的界線，以嚴重違法的手段，自己強行非法進入或煽惑他人，當中包括年輕人及學生，強行非法進入政總前地——一個當時他們和其他示威者在法律上都沒有權利可以進入的地方，而干犯了參與非法集結或煽惑他人參與非法集結。答辯人等也不能說，上訴法庭對他們處以的刑罰，壓縮了他們可依法行使示威、集會或言論自由的空間。只要他們在法律的界線內行事，法律會全面、充份地保障他們示威、集會和言論自由；但一旦他們僭越了法律的界線而違法，法律制裁他們並不是剝奪或打壓他們的示威、集會和言論自由，因為法律從來都絶不容許他們以違法的手段來行使那些自由。」",
