            "Following is a question by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (November 11):",
            "Question:",
            "The COVID-19 Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Scheme, established under the Anti-epidemic Fund by the Government, was launched on June 29 this year. Under the Scheme, an arbitration and mediation institution has been appointed to provide speedy ODR services to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as members of the public. The following conditions are to be met for disputes to be admitted under the Scheme: (i) the dispute is related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), (ii) the claim amount does not exceed $500,000, and (iii) either one of the parties involved in the dispute is a Hong Kong resident or company. The parties involved are required to pay $200 each as registration fee, while the fees for the mediators and arbitrators will be paid by the Government. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it knows the number of cases received so far under the Scheme, with a tabulated breakdown by (i) the group to which the claim amount belongs (each group spanning $100,000), (ii) the type of dispute, and (iii) whether or not either one of the parties involved is a resident or company from (a) the Mainland or (b) an overseas country/region; of the public expenditure incurred so far on the Scheme;",
            "(2) whether it knows, among those cases mentioned in (1), the respective total numbers of cases (a) admitted and (b) rejected; among the cases admitted, the respective numbers of those in which the parties involved (i) are negotiating, (ii) are receiving mediation, (iii) have reached a settlement, (iv) are undergoing arbitration, and (v) have obtained an arbitral award, in respect of their disputes; regarding those cases in which a settlement has been reached, the major types of disputes involved, the average overall processing time for such cases, and the range of the claim amounts agreed to by the parties involved;",
            "(3) whether it knows the respective numbers of arbitrators and mediators participating in the Scheme, with a breakdown by the professional qualifications they possess; whether they are required to undergo any special training and examination before participating in the Scheme; if so, of the details of such training and the passing rate of such examination;",
            "(4) whether it knows the respective to-date numbers and percentages of arbitrators and mediators who have provided services under the Scheme; and",
            "(5) whether it has reviewed, in respect of the Scheme, the response received since its launch, its cost effectiveness and whether its objectives have been achieved; if it has reviewed, of the outcome, and the Government's follow-up measures; if it has not reviewed, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "It is a global trend to develop and use online dispute resolution (ODR) services to provide a reliable and efficient platform to facilitate alternative dispute resolution (ADR). In light of the pandemic's impact on the economy and in anticipation of an upsurge of disputes arising from or relating to the pandemic, the Government announced on April 8, 2020 the establishment of the COVID-19 Online Dispute Resolution Scheme (Scheme) under the second round of the Anti-epidemic Fund to provide speedy and cost effective ODR services to the general public and businesses, in particular micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The Scheme starts from negotiation and mediation so as to prevent entrenched views on the conflicts, thereby helping to foster harmony in society. It also provides an ADR mechanism which may help relieve the Court's caseload in civil claims.",
            "On May 18, 2020, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre Limited (eBRAM Centre) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Scheme to govern and monitor the use of the relevant funding. A funding support totalling $70 million was provided, including (i) $50 million covering the cost of the first 12 months of platform development and initial set-up (including staff), as well as the operation cost in the first year; and (ii) $20 million covering the fees of mediators and arbitrators for an estimate of 2,000 cases in the first year. After the platform has been established and in operation for one year, eBRAM Centre may continue to make use of the platform for other purposes, for example for serving the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies after eBRAM Centre is listed under the APEC Collaborative Framework for ODR. eBRAM Centre may also adapt and make necessary modifications to the platform to handle other cases beyond the Scheme.",
            "The Scheme was launched on June 29, 2020.",
            "In relation to the Hon Yung Hoi-yan's questions, the DoJ replies as follows:",
            "(1) to (4) According to the MoU entered into by eBRAM Centre and the Government in May 2020, eBRAM Centre is required to regularly report to the Government on the progress of the Scheme. As the Scheme was launched only less than half a year ago, eBRAM Centre is still in the process of compiling the relevant statistics. It plans to report the latest progress of the Scheme, including the relevant statistics and details, to the Legislative Council Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services later this year.",
            "According to the preliminary information provided by eBRAM Centre, since the launch of the Scheme, over 150 mediators and arbitrators have been enlisted in the Scheme and the training provided by eBRAM Centre to them has also been completed. The arbitrators and mediators enlisted in the Scheme come from different sectors, while those from the legal sector account for the majority. All of the participants are selected from the lists of arbitrators and mediators maintained by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong, and are professionals who have passed the assessment and possess sufficient experience in arbitration and mediation. Before their eligibility to participate in the Scheme is confirmed, participants must first complete the training course provided by eBRAM Centre. The content of the training course includes understanding of the eBRAM Rules for the Scheme, the arbitration and mediation process and operational guidelines of the online platform, as well as recent developments of ODR etc. The training course was conducted online and was delivered by senior arbitrators, mediators of the sector and prominent academics in the field of ODR. All of the arbitrators and mediators enlisted in the Scheme had passed the training course provided by eBRAM Centre eventually.",
            "(5) As afore-mentioned, the Scheme aims to provide the general public and businesses that are involved in disputes arising from or in relation to the pandemic with a speedy and cost-effective means to resolve such disputes by deploying ODR. The Scheme also provides the benefits of job creation and job advancement for the legal and dispute resolution sectors including mediators, arbitrators and their pupils. At the same time, the DoJ hopes to, through the Scheme, facilitate the development of Hong Kong's ODR services and enhance Hong Kong's LawTech capability.",
            "The Scheme was launched less than half a year ago and is still at its initial stage. We are delighted that the Scheme received very positive response from the general public. The Scheme has also successfully aroused the interest of relevant stakeholders as the number of inquiries and applications received by eBRAM Centre have been on the rise. The DoJ will continue to work closely with eBRAM Centre to jointly promote the Scheme.",
            "eBRAM Centre has been proactively promoting the Scheme locally, to the Mainland and globally through various means and channels, including actively participating in various types of webinars (for example the China International Fair for Trade in Services 2020's Mainland-Hong Kong Services Industry Forum 2020, In-House Community e-Congress Japan 2020 and In-House Community e-Congress Hong Kong 2020). Furthermore, eBRAM Centre also promoted the Scheme through interviews with different media and with various chambers of commerce in Hong Kong. Currently, eBRAM Centre has reached consensus with relevant local organisations and bodies to jointly further promote the Scheme.",
            "Moreover, the Scheme has helped advance the relevant skills and capabilities of mediators and arbitrators, as well as facilitated the development of an ODR platform by eBRAM Centre, which signifies an important milestone for Hong Kong's ODR services development. The DoJ will continue to monitor the progress of the Scheme and conduct timely review of its effectiveness.",

            "主席：",
            "發展及使用網上爭議解決服務，為利便進行替代爭議解決提供可靠便捷的平台是全球趨勢。因應疫情對經濟造成影響，容易引起更多爭議和糾紛，政府於今年四月八日宣布在第二輪「防疫抗疫基金」下設立「2019冠狀病毒病網上爭議解決計劃」（計劃），為公眾和企業（尤其是中小微型企業）提供快捷和具成本效益的網上爭議解決服務。計劃從談判和調解開始，防止加劇衝突，有助建立社會和諧；亦提供替代爭議解決機制，可有助紓緩法院民事索償的案件量。",
            "律政司於今年五月十八日與一邦國際網上仲調中心（eBRAM中心）就計劃簽訂諒解備忘錄，以管理和監督相關撥款的使用。撥款資助總額為7,000萬元，包括（i）5,000萬元涵蓋網上平台最初十二個月的發展及初期設置的開支（包括員工），以及首年營運開支；（ii）2,000萬元涵蓋調解員及仲裁員於首年內處理大約2 000個案件的費用。在網上平台成立及運作一年後，eBRAM中心可繼續利用網上平台作其他用途，例如在該中心成為《亞太經濟合作組織網上解決爭議合作框架》下的機構後為亞太經濟合作組織的經濟體提供服務。eBRAM中心亦可為處理計劃外的案件對網上平台進行改良或作有需要的調整。",
            "計劃於今年六月二十九日正式展開。",
            "就容海恩議員的提問，律政司現回覆如下：",
            "（一）至（四）根據政府於今年五月與eBRAM中心簽署的諒解備忘錄，eBRAM中心需向政府定期匯報計劃的進度。計劃推出至今不足半年，eBRAM中心正在準備相關的統計數字，並計劃今年稍後向立法會司法及法律事務委員會交代計劃的最新進展，包括相關的統計數字及詳情。",
            "根據eBRAM中心提供的初步資料，自計劃展開以來，共有超過150名的調解員和仲裁員參與計劃，eBRAM中心亦完成了對他們的培訓。參與計劃的仲裁員和調解員來自不同的界別，當中以來自法律界的人士佔最多。全部參與人士均選拔自香港國際仲裁中心、香港大律師公會及香港律師會的仲裁員和調解員名冊，全屬已通過考核及具有一定仲裁和調解經驗的專業人士。在獲確認參與資格前，參與人士必須先完成由中心所提供的培訓課程。課程內容包括對《eBRAM新型冠狀病毒網上爭議解決計劃規則》的認知、網上平台的仲裁及調解流程和操作指引，以及關於網上爭議解決的新發展等。培訓透過網絡視頻形式進行，由業界資深的仲裁員、調解員和網上爭議解決領域的知名學者進行講授。最終全部參與人士均成功通過中心的培訓課程。",
            "（五）正如上文所述，計劃旨在為牽涉在因疫情而引起或與之有關的爭議的公眾及企業提供快捷及具成本效益的網上爭議解決方法，並同時為業界包括調解員、仲裁員及其學徒帶來就業機會和提升工作能力的好處。同時，律政司亦希望透過計劃促進香港的網上爭議解決服務發展，並增強香港的法律科技能力。",
            "計劃推出至今不足半年，目前仍處於計劃初期，我們樂見公眾對計劃反應非常正面，而計劃亦成功引起有關持份者的興趣，eBRAM中心所接獲的查詢和申請與日俱增。律政司會繼續與eBRAM中心緊密合作，共同推廣計劃。",
            "eBRAM中心會透過多種方式和渠道積極向本地、內地和世界各地推廣計劃，包括積極參與各類型的網上研討會（例如中國國際服務貿易交易會2020的內地—香港服務貿易論壇2020、日本企業法律顧問線上大會2020、香港企業法律顧問線上大會2020）。另外，eBRAM中心亦透過不同媒體訪問及香港各類型商會等途徑宣傳計劃。目前eBRAM中心已經與本地相關機構和組織達成共識，共同進一步推廣計劃。",
            "此外，計劃有助提升調解員和仲裁員的相關技巧和工作能力，亦促使eBRAM中心開發網上爭議解決平台，是香港網上爭議解決服務發展的重要里程碑。律政司會繼續監察計劃的進行，並適時檢視計劃的成效。",
