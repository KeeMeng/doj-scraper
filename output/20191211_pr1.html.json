            "Following is a question by the Hon Luk Chung-hung and a reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (December 11):",
            "Question:",
            "The cumulative number of persons arrested, since June this year in relation to the disturbances arising from the proposed legislative amendments, is as high as several thousands, with some of them being, one after another, charged with the relevant offences. On the 4th of last month, when a case involving five defendants was brought before the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts, a misnomer for one of the defendants and inconsistency in the Chinese and English versions of the charges were uncovered in the consent to prosecution of the Department of Justice (DoJ). As a result, the prosecution had to withdraw the charges against all the defendants. Later on, the DoJ instituted prosecutions against them afresh. Regarding the prosecution work of the DoJ, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the number of cases in each of the past five years in which the trial processes were affected by errors made by the prosecutors, and the details of such errors; the number of cases in which the trials were discontinued, the number of defendants who were released by the court unconditionally, and the number of convicted persons who were imposed a more lenient punishment, as a result of such errors;",
            "(2) whether the DoJ has reviewed the causes of the prosecutors’ making such errors so as to avoid the recurrence of such errors; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; whether the officers concerned were subject to any disciplinary actions; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and",
            "(3) whether, in order to cope with the increasingly heavy prosecution workload brought about by handling the cases relating to the disturbances arising from the proposed legislative amendments, the DoJ has examined the employment of additional manpower and measures for expediting prosecution work; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The rule of law is the core value of Hong Kong. A criminal justice process includes investigation, prosecution, defence, adjudication and punishment, of which prosecutors carry out their roles as an integral part of it. When conducting prosecutions, a prosecutor is required to comply with and promote the rule of law, fairly and objectively assisting the court to arrive at the truth and to do justice in accordance with the law. Professional, impartial and independent prosecution work is pivotal in safeguarding the rule of law in Hong Kong.",
            "Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that “the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference”. Prosecutors of the Department of Justice (DoJ) always shoulder the constitutional duty enshrined therein.",
            "The Prosecution Code (the Code) compiled by the DoJ provides reference points and guidance for prosecutors in prosecution work. It states that the responsibility of prosecutors is to apply the highest of professional standards in handling criminal cases. According to paragraph 1.2 of the Code, a prosecutor must not be influenced by any investigatory, political, media, community or individual interest or representation. In making decisions of whether or not to prosecute, the DoJ must make an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and applicable law, and act in accordance with the Code. Cases will not be handled differently owing to the political beliefs or background of the persons involved.",
            "The Secretary for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the prosecution team have all along been discharging their prosecutorial duties fairly and without prejudice or favour in accordance with the above principles so as to safeguard criminal justice.",
            "In relation to the Hon Luk Chung-hung’s specific questions, the DoJ’s detailed reply is as follows:",
            "(1) The DoJ does not maintain the requested figures. Generally, when conducting prosecutions, including handling prosecution documents, prosecutors of the DoJ are required to handle all criminal cases professionally and in strict accordance with the law and the relevant guidelines in the Code.",
            "Regarding the handling of the case mentioned at the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts on November 4 this year, the DoJ had made submissions to the Court, which were accepted by the Court. As the five defendants concerned have been immediately arrested and charged, and the relevant legal proceedings remain ongoing, it is not appropriate for the DoJ to comment further.",
            "(2) The civil service performance management system for civil servants formulated by the Civil Service Bureau serves as an official mechanism to monitor and assess staff performance. Civil servants' performance is reflected in an honest, objective and comprehensive manner in their appraisal reports.",
            "Where any act, conduct or behaviour of an officer is in breach of the Civil Service Code or government regulations, the department concerned will take appropriate follow-up actions in accordance with established procedures. If there is evidence upon investigation that a civil servant has misconducted himself, or a civil servant has been convicted of criminal offence by the Court, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken, including imposing disciplinary punishment of verbal warning, written warning, reprimand, severe reprimand, reduction in rank, compulsory retirement and dismissal, etc. The above mechanism is applicable to civil servants of different grades and ranks including prosecutors of the DoJ.",
            "The Code also sets out the role and duties of prosecutors. DoJ’s prosecutors have always discharged their prosecutorial responsibilities in accordance with the relevant principles and have at all times exercised the highest standards of integrity and care in maintaining proper administration of justice.",
            "The DoJ attaches great importance to the professional qualities of prosecutors and provides them with continuing education and training. Moreover, the Prosecutions Division (PD) of the DoJ has established procedures to regularly remind all prosecutors of points to note. It also reviews and updates from time to time the approaches and procedures in handling criminal cases for enhancement of prosecution work.",
            "(3) All criminal investigations are conducted by law enforcement agencies, which will, when necessary, refer cases to the DoJ for independent decisions on whether to prosecute. The DoJ at all times seeks to provide legal advice to law enforcement agencies, including the Police, as expeditiously as possible. The processing time from commencement of investigation to institution of prosecution for each case depends on various factors, such as the time required for investigation by law enforcement agencies, the volume of evidence, and the nature and complexity of the case.",
            "There are currently over 200 prosecutors in the PD of the DoJ. There has been a dedicated team of prosecutors within the PD for handling cases concerning public order events to ensure consistency in the handling approach. In view of the recent increase in the number of public order event cases, the DoJ has also arranged for officers who had formerly served in that dedicated team to assist in work relating to prosecutorial decisions. Subject to the overall operational needs of the PD, we do not rule out the possibility of introducing measures as necessary in the future such as deployment of additional manpower to handle relevant cases.",
            "The DoJ will continue to maintain communications with the Police and to conduct its prosecution work in a fair, effective and efficient manner.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "（一）過去五年，每年檢控人員的出錯影響到審訊程序的案件宗數，以及有關錯誤的詳情；該等錯誤分別導致多少宗案件中止審訊、多少名被告人獲當庭釋放，以及多少名被定罪人士被判較輕刑罰；",
            "（二）律政司有否對導致檢控人員出錯的原因進行檢討，以免再次出錯；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；涉事人員有否遭紀律處分；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及",

            "主席：",
            "法治是香港的核心價值。刑事司法過程包括調查、檢控、辯護、審裁及懲處。檢控人員的職責，屬於刑事司法過程的主要一環。在執行檢控工作時，檢控人員務必遵守和維護法治，公正客觀地協助法庭找出真相，依法秉行公義。專業、無私和獨立地進行檢控工作，是維護香港法治的關鍵。",
            "《基本法》第六十三條訂明：「香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」。律政司的檢控人員一直肩負起該條訂下的憲制責任。",
            "由律政司編訂的《檢控守則》為檢控人員執行檢控工作提供參考基準和指引，當中指出檢控人員的責任，是以最高的專業標準處理刑事案件。根據《檢控守則》第1.2段，檢控人員不得受任何涉及調查、政治、傳媒、社群或個人的利益或陳述的因素影響。作出檢控與否的決定時，律政司必須就所得證據和適用法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按《檢控守則》行事，不會因涉案者的政治理念或背景而有所不同。",
            "律政司司長、刑事檢控專員及刑事檢控科團隊在進行檢控工作時，一貫秉持上述原則行事，不偏不倚、一視同仁，以維持司法公義。",
            "就陸頌雄議員的具體提問，律政司現詳細回覆如下。",
            "（一）律政司沒有備存問題要求提供的數字。一般而言，律政司的檢控人員進行所有檢控工作時，包括處理檢控文件，均須嚴格按照法律和《檢控守則》下的相關指引專業地處理所有刑事案件。",
            "就本年十一月四日在東區裁判法院提堂的一宗案件的處理情況，律政司在庭上已作出陳述，法庭亦已接納律政司的解釋。由於該案五名被告已隨即被捕和被控，而司法程序仍在進行中，律政司不適宜作進一步評論。",
            "（二）公務員事務局制訂公務員工作表現管理制度，為監察和評估公務員的工作表現，提供正式機制。公務員的工作表現會如實、客觀和全面地反映於其評核報告中。",
            "公務員的行為、操守和表現如違反《公務員守則》或政府規例，其所屬部門會按既定程序採取適當的跟進行動。如在調查後當局認為有證據顯示有關公務員有不當行為或有公務員被法院裁定干犯刑事罪行，便會採取適當的紀律行動，包括口頭警告、書面警告、譴責、嚴厲譴責、降級、迫令退休或革職等紀律處分。律政司的所有公務員，包括檢控人員，亦受上述同一機制規限。",
            "《檢控守則》亦闡述了檢控人員的角色及職務。律政司的檢控人員一直按照相關原則履行檢控職責，在任何時間皆秉持公正廉潔，謹慎從事，以最高標準來維持司法公義。",
            "律政司非常注重檢控人員的專業質素，並為檢控人員提供持續進修培訓。另外，律政司刑事檢控科有既定程序，定時提醒所有檢控人員需注意的事項。刑事檢控科亦一直就刑事案件處理的方式或程序不時作出檢討和更新，務求完善檢控工作。",
            "（三）所有刑事案件的調查工作由執法機關負責，執法機關有需要時才會交予律政司獨立決定是否提出檢控。無論任何時候，律政司都會竭盡所能，盡快為包括警方在內的執法機關提供法律意見。就每宗案件由展開調查至提出檢控所需要的處理時間，須視乎多項因素而定，例如執法機關進行調查所需的時間、證據的數量、案件性質及複雜程度等。",
            "律政司刑事檢控科現時有超過200名檢控人員。刑事檢控科一直設有一隊檢控人員專責處理有關「公眾秩序活動」的案件，目的是保持處理的方法一致。鑑於最近有關「公眾秩序活動」的案件增加，律政司亦安排了曾於該專責隊伍工作過的同事協助參與檢控決定的相關工作。在顧及刑事檢控科整體運作需要的情況下，我們不排除在未來有需要時採取適當措施，例如調動更多的人手處理相關案件。",
