            "Following is the translation of a speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in moving the second reading of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill in the Legislative Council today (March 26):",
            "President,",
            "I move that the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill be read the second time.",
            "The purpose of the Bill is to implement the recommendations of the report on Privity of Contract published by the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC) in September 2005 so as to reform the common law doctrine of privity of contract.",
            "Under the common law doctrine of privity, a person not a party to a contract (i.e. a \"third party\") cannot acquire or enforce rights under the contract. This prevents effect from being given to the contracting parties' intention to benefit a third party. This doctrine has long been criticised as contrary to the parties' intention to benefit a third party. In certain circumstances, the court may even need recourse to devices such as agency or trust to allow a third party to enforce a right conferred on the third party. In some other cases, a third party may have to resort to separate contracts. This not only brings about inconvenience and complexity, but also extra cost.",
            "The LRC has studied the relevant reforms conducted in various common law jurisdictions such as Australia, England and New Zealand and recommended that this aspect of the doctrine of privity, under which a third person cannot acquire or enforce rights under a contract, be reformed by way of legislation. Having carefully considered the LRC's recommendations and the views of the relevant stakeholders, the Administration introduces the Bill to implement LRC's recommendations.",
            "The key features of the Bill can be outlined as follows:",
            "Who is a Third Party",
            "The Bill provides that a third party, that is a person who is not a party to the contract, must be expressly identified in the contract by name, as a member of a class or as answering a particular description. Rights may also be conferred on a third party who is not in existence, for example, an unborn baby, when the contract is entered into.",
            "Test of Enforceability",
            "The Bill provides for a two-limb test and the satisfaction of either limb will permit a third party to enforce the relevant term of the contract:",
            "(1) a third party may enforce the contract if the contract contains an express term to that effect; or",
            "(2) if a contract contains a term which purports to confer a benefit on a third party, that party may enforce that term unless on a proper construction of the contract, parties to the contract do not intend that the third party may do so.",
            "Besides, parties to a contract can expressly exclude the application of this new statutory scheme in their contract.",
            "In order to strike a balance between the protection of the freedom of contracting parties to vary the terms of a contract on the one hand and the protection of the interests of a third party who may suffer as a result of the variation to the contract on the other, the Bill provides for the circumstances in which a third party's rights are \"crystallised\" such that the contracting parties may not rescind the contract or vary it in a way that affects the third party's rights.",
            "Defences Available to Promisor and Protection Against Double Liability",
            "Subject to the provisions of the Bill, a third party may enforce a term of the contract against the promisor of the contract. The Bill provides for defences, set-offs and counterclaims to be available to a promisor in proceedings brought by a third party and also protects a promisor against double liability.",
            "Arbitration Clauses",
            "The Bill deals with two situations in relation to arbitration. The first situation is that if a third party's right to enforce a term of a contract is subject to an arbitration agreement, the third party must enforce the term by way of arbitration and be treated as a party to the arbitration agreement, unless on a proper construction of the contract, the third party is not intended to be so treated.",
            "The second situation is where a third party is given an enforceable procedural right under a contract, for example, by way of an express provision providing for arbitration of disputes where a promisor brings a non-contractual claim (such as tortious or statutory claim) in connection with a contract against a third party, then the third party may enforce the procedural right to submit the disputes to arbitration.",
            "Scope of Application",
            "As to the scope of application, the new statutory scheme does not apply to contracts entered into before the commencement of the scheme so that existing rights, obligations or remedies of contracting parties and a third party will not be affected.",
            "In addition, the Bill excludes two major types of contracts:",
            "(1) The first type of contracts excluded is: contracts where a third party has no enforceable right under existing rules but there are sound policy reasons for maintaining that position (for example, the articles of a company having effect as a contract under the Companies Ordinance).",
            "(2) The second type of contracts excluded is: contracts where a third party already has an enforceable right under existing rules reflecting international conventions or where allowing third parties to claim a right of enforceability would contradict or prejudice the underlying policies of certain areas of law. For example, a bill of exchange, a contract for the carriage of goods by sea, and a covenant relating to land, including a deed of mutual covenant as defined in section 2 of the Building Management Ordinance.",
            "Views from the Public and Legislative Council's Panel",
            "The Administration has consulted the legal profession and other stakeholders on the Bill. The legal professional bodies did not raise any objection to the legislative proposal. The Administration has carefully considered various technical comments and drafting suggestions raised by the legal professional bodies and the academia, and has taken on board the suggestion of the Hong Kong Bar Association by excluding land covenants (including deeds of mutual covenant) from the new statutory scheme. The Legislative Council's Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services has also indicated its support to the policy objectives of the Bill.",
            "Concluding Remarks",
            "President, as I mentioned at the beginning of this speech, the common law doctrine of privity has long been considered as giving rise to injustice or inconvenience on third parties' rights and not fully reflecting contracting parties' intention. Various common law jurisdictions including England have reformed the doctrine of privity by way of legislation. The Administration believes that the Bill would enhance Hong Kong's contractual law regime and align it with those of the other major common law jurisdictions.",
            "With these remarks, I would like to appeal to Members to support the Bill.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（三月二十六日）在立法會會議動議二讀《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》的發言全文：",
            "主席:",
            "我謹動議二讀《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》。",
            "《條例草案》的目的，是落實香港法律改革委員會（法改會）在二○○五年九月發表的《立約各方的相互關係報告書》有關改革普通法下合約各方相互關係原則的建議。",
            "在普通法的相互關係原則下，非合約一方的人士（即「第三者」）不能根據合約而取得或強制執行權利。因此，合約各方要令第三者受惠的意願不能得到落實。這原則往往與合約各方希望令第三者受惠的意願相違背，因此一直受到批評。在個別情況，法院甚至需要借助代理或信託等其他法律原則，以容許第三者強制執行合約授予第三者的權利。在某些情況下，第三者為了強制執行有關權利而可能需要借助另行訂立的合約，因而造成不便和複雜的情況，亦會衍生額外的費用。",
            "法改會參考了多個普通法司法管轄區就這方面的改革，包括澳大利亞、英國、新西蘭等，建議透過立法，改革相互關係原則中有關第三者不能根據合約而取得或強制執行權利的內容。當局在詳細考慮法改會的建議及相關持份者的意見後，現提交《條例草案》以落實法改會的建議。",
            "《條例草案》的主要內容可簡述如下：",
            "誰是第三者",
            "《條例草案》訂明第三者，即並非合約一方的人士，必須為合約中明文點名的人士或某類別人士，或屬符合明文特定描述者。在有關合約訂立時並不存在的第三者，例如未出生的嬰孩，也可獲授予權利。",
            "可強制執行合約權利的驗證準則",
            "《條例草案》訂明兩項準則，如符合其中一項準則，第三者便可強制執行合約中的相關條款：",
            "（1）如合約載有具此效力的明訂條款，第三者即可強制執行合約；或",
            "（2）如合約載有看來是賦予第三者利益的條款，該第三者也可強制執行該條款，但若依據合約的恰當解釋，合約各方的真正用意是第三者不可強制執行該條款，則屬例外。",
            "此外，合約各方可在合約中明文規定這個新的法定機制不適用於該合約。",
            "撤銷及更改合約",
            "合約各方更改合約條款的自由應受到保障，但另一方面亦要保障可能因該等合約的更改而受損害的第三者的權益。為了在這兩方面作出平衡，《條例草案》訂明一些第三者的權利已出現「具體化」的情況下，合約各方則不得撤銷合約或以影響第三者權利的方式更改合約。",
            "許諾人可用的答辯及無須承擔雙重法律責任",
            "在符合《條例草案》的規定下，第三者可針對合約中的許諾人強制執行合約的有關條款；《條例草案》訂明許諾人在第三者提起的法律程序中可用的答辯、抵銷及反申索，同時保障許諾人無須承擔雙重法律責任。",
            "仲裁條款",
            "《條例草案》處理了兩種涉及仲裁的情況。第一種情況是當第三者強制執行某合約條款的權利受某仲裁協議所規限，該第三者必須藉仲裁強制執行該條款，並必須被視為有關仲裁協議的一方；但若依據有關合約的恰當解釋，立約用意並非使該第三者須視為有關仲裁協議的一方，則屬例外。",
            "第二種情況是當第三者獲合約授予可強制執行的程序權利，例如合約有明訂條文規定，就許諾人針對第三者提出與合約有關的非合約申索（例如侵權或法定申索），須透過仲裁解決，第三者則可強制執行有關程序權利，從而將爭議提交仲裁解決。",
            "適用範圍",
            "在適用範圍方面，新的法定機制不適用於有關機制生效前訂立的合約，因此合約各方及第三者的現有權利、責任或可採用的補救措施不會受影響。",
            "此外，《條例草案》豁除兩大類別的合約︰",
            "（1）第一類別獲豁除的合約是︰第三者根據現存規則沒有任何可強制執行的權利，但有充分的政策理由維持這種狀況，例如根據《公司條例》具有合約效力的章程細則。",
            "（2）第二類別獲豁除的合約是：第三者根據反映國際公約的現存規則已經具有可強制執行的權利，或者如果准許第三者申索可強制執行的權利會否定或損害某些法律的基礎及原則，例如匯票、海上貨物運輸合約，以及關乎土地的契諾（包括《建築物管理條例》第2條所界定的公契）。",
            "公眾及事務委員會的意見",
            "當局已就《條例草案》的建議，徵詢法律界及其他持份者。法律專業團體對立法建議並無提出任何異議。當局也詳細考慮法律專業團體和學者所提出的各項技術意見及草擬建議，並同意香港大律師公會的建議，將關乎土地的契諾（包括公契）豁除於新的法定機制外。此外，立法會司法及法律事務委員會亦表示支持《條例草案》的政策方針。",
            "結語",
            "主席，正如我在開始發言時提到，普通法下合約各方的相互關係原則長久以來被認為會對第三者權利造成不公平或不方便的情況，也未能充分體現立約各方的真實意願。包括英國在內的多個普通法司法管轄區，均已透過立法形式改革相互關係原則。當局相信《條例草案》不但能完善香港的合約法，更可令香港的有關法律與其他主要的普通法司法管轄區一致。",
            "我謹此陳辭，希望各位議員支持本《條例草案》。",
