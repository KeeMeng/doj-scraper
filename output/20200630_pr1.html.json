The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, issued the following statement:",
            "The National Security Law is targeted at the criminal acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security. It provides clear rules and legal basis for preventing, curbing and punishing those who breach the law to endanger national security, and is conducive to safeguarding national security.",
            "The National Security Law also specifies that the HKSAR should observe the important principles of the rule of law, including the presumption of innocence, the rights of defence and the rule against double jeopardy. It also clearly states that the HKSAR should protect the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents in accordance with law.",
            "Welcoming the passage of the National Security Law and its inclusion in Annex III to the Basic Law to be promulgated and implemented in the HKSAR, Ms Cheng would continue to lead the Department of Justice (DoJ) to provide full support for and discharge the responsibility of safeguarding national security in the HKSAR.",
            "As one of the members of the Committee for Safeguarding National Security to be chaired by the Chief Executive, Ms Cheng is committed to assisting in formulating policies and implementing the relevant legal system.",
