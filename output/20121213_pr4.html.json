            "13 December 2012 is an important date in the chronicle of Hong Kong’s development as an international legal services centre. It is the date set for the opening ceremony of the Asia Pacific Regional Office (‘Regional Office’) of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (‘Hague Conference’). The fact that the Regional Office is established in Hong Kong represents a vote of confidence in Hong Kong’s legal system and the implementation of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’, as well as reinforces Hong Kong’s status as a regional hub of international legal services.",
            "The Government Policy",
            "For years, it has been the policy of the Government to build and maintain Hong Kong as an international legal services centre. The setting up of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in the mid-1980s illustrated the early effort in this direction. In 2008, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chambers of Commerce established its Secretariat in Hong Kong, which is the very first and thus far the only secretariat outside its headquarters in Paris. In Septmber this year, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission established its first arbitration centre outside the Mainland. The Government’s recent decision to allocate part of the space in the West Wing of the former Central Government Office to house law-related non-government institutions helps to fortify this policy.",
            "This policy plays an important role in promoting the rule of law, and also in maintaining Hong Kong as an international city.",
            "The importance of the rule of law cannot and should not be doubted. I have on previous occasions reiterated the determination of this Administration to steadfastly maintain the rule of law. Although this is not the occasion to discuss in detail the concept of the rule of law, it is necessary to stress that the concept has both domestic and international dimensions. It is of course important to ensure that all Hong Kong people can enjoy their rights and freedom enshrined under the Basic Law, the Bill of Rights and other relevant legislations. It is no less important to ensure that the legal system of Hong Kong and our legal infrastructure can properly interact with those of other jurisdictions and function 2efficiently on an international level, so that activities with international elements can be undertaken and regulated (and when necessary, enforcement actions taken) according to a set of common standards consistent with the fundamental concept of the rule of law.",
            "Apart from being an international and cosmopolitan city, Hong Kong is well recognised as an international centre for financial, shipping, logistics and other commercial activities. Amongst others, the availability of a wide range of top quality legal services on both domestic and international level has made significant contribution to this state of affairs. To continue Hong Kong’s success story and to maintain an edge over other cities in the Asian Pacific region, it is of utmost importance to enhance Hong Kong’s international presence and to ensure that our legal system and legal infrastructure will remain in the forefront of international development. Accordingly, the policy to maintain and enhance Hong Kong’s status as an international legal services centre is one which we can ill afford not to pursue.",
            "Hague Conference",
            "The participation in the meetings of the Hague Conference and the efforts made to procure the setting up of its Regional Office in Hong Kong are steps taken in the implementation this policy.",
            "Since its first session in 1893, Hague Conference has since become a global inter-governmental organisation with 72 members (71 states and the European Union). Further, an increasing number of non-member states are becoming parties to Hague Conventions. Its goal is to work for a world in which, despite the differences between legal systems, both natural persons and legal entities can enjoy a high degree of legal certainty.",
            "The principal method used by Hague Conference to achieve its goal is the negotiation, drafting and adoption of multilateral treaties or conventions in different fields of private international law. Conventions hitherto adopted cover a wide variety of matters, including those concerning child abduction, inter-country adoption, protection of children, international recovery of children and family support, divorce, service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents, taking of evidence abroad in civil and commercial matters, the abolition of legalisation for foreign public documents, choice of court 3agreements and holding of securities by intermediaries. These matters are relevant not only to commercial activities, but also personal and family activities which are likewise becoming more and more international.",
            "Since 1998, representatives from Hong Kong have been participating actively in meetings of the Hague Conference as part of the PRC delegation. This is made possible by the relevant provisions in our Basic Law. In 2008, Hong Kong hosted the Third Asia Pacific Regional Conference of the Hague Conference. Since then, with strong support from the Central Government (especially the assistance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), efforts were made to procure the setting up of the Regional Office in Hong Kong. Such efforts came to fruition in April 2012 when the Hague Conference’s Council on General Affairs and Policy endorsed the proposal to establish the Regional Office in Hong Kong.",
            "My predecessor, Mr. Wong Yan Lung SC, has previously and aptly likened the work of the Hague Conference to the building of bridges, helping to link up different jurisdictions with different legal systems and traditions around the world. Following this analogy, the setting up of the Regional Office in Hong Kong will make Hong Kong an important hub in this global network of bridges.",
            "The Road Ahead",
            "The question of how Hong Kong should position herself is an important one in shaping Hong Kong’s future. On top of sparing no efforts to maintain the rule of law and resolving livelihood issues, it is crystal clear that Hong Kong should stay international. Further steps should be taken to engage with as well as to attract reputable international law-related institutions to establish a regional office or centre in Hong Kong. More efforts should be made in the promotion of Hong Kong as a regional hub of dispute resolution (especially through arbitration and mediation). On the basis of what Hong Kong has thus far achieved and with the support of the relevant stakeholders, the future development in this regard is a promising one.",

            "在香港發展為國際法律服務中心的歷程中，2012年12月13日是一個重要的日子。海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）在香港成立亞太區區域辦事處（區域辦事處）的開幕儀式將於該日舉行。海牙會議在香港設立該區域辦事處，代表對香港法律制度及「一國兩制」的落實投下信心一票，亦强化香港作為國際法律服務區域樞紐的地位。",
            "政府政策",
            "多年來，建立及維持香港作為國際法律服務中心一直是香港政府的政策，早期的努力成果包括在八十年代中期成立香港國際仲裁中心。國際商會的國際仲裁院於 2008 年在香港設立秘書處分處，成為其巴黎總部以外設立的首個秘書處分處，亦是至今唯一的分處。今年九月，中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會也在香港設立首個在內地以外的仲裁中心。政府最近決定將前中區政府合署西座部分地方預留給法律相關的非政府機構，也有助落實這項政策。",
            "這項政策對推動法治及保持香港作為一個國際都會扮演着重要角色。",
            "法治的重要性毋庸置疑。我過往在不同場合已重申現屆政府堅持維護法治的決心。雖然不宜在這篇文章詳細討論法治這概念，但必須強調法治這概念包括本地和國際兩個層面。確保港人可以享受《基本法》、人權法和其他相關法律所賦予的自由和權利固然重要。但同樣重要的，是要確保香港的法律制度及法律基建能與其他地方的相關制度及基建妥善地互動，並能在國際層面有效率地運作，從而令香港與其他地方之間的活動，能夠根據一套符合法治基本概念的共同標準進行和受規管，並在有需要時進行執法行動。",
            "香港是一個國際大都會，亦是公認的國際金融、航運、物流及其他商貿活動的中心。香港能提供多樣化和優越的本地及國際法律服務，亦是香港成功因素之一。要延續香港的成功故事和維持在亞太區的競爭優勢，加強香港在國際層面的參與，及確保我們的法律制度和法律基建走在國際發展的前端，確實至為重要。因此，維持及提升香港作為國際法律服務中心地位的政策，必須持之以恆。",
            "海牙會議",
            "參與海牙會議的相關會議，並爭取海牙會議在香港成立區域辦事處，亦是落實上述政策的方式之一。",
            "自從 1893 年舉行首次會議以來，海牙會議已蛻變成為全球跨政府的組織，至今共有 72 位成員（包括 71 個國家和歐盟）。此外，愈來愈多的非成員國加入成為《海牙公約》的締約成員。海牙會議的目標，是希望締造一個世界性網絡，令當中的自然人和法律實體在不同的法律體系下仍可享有高度的法律確定性。",
            "海牙會議達致其目標的主要方法，是透過磋商、擬定及採納不同國際私法範疇的多邊條約或公約。至今已訂立的國際公約涵蓋層面十分廣泛，內容包括擄拐兒童、跨國收養、保護兒童、國際追討供養子女及家庭費用、離婚、向國外送達司法及其他文書、從國外調取民事及商事證據、取消外國公文的法律認可要求、法院選擇協議、及中介人持有證券而涉及的若干權益等事宜。這些事宜並非只局限於與商貿活動有關的事情，也包括現時日趨國際化的個人及家庭事務。",
            "自從 1998 年以來，有賴《基本法》的相關條文，香港的代表一直能以中國代表團成員的身分積極參與海牙會議的相關會議。在 2008 年，海牙會議第三屆亞太區會議更在香港舉行。自此，在中央政府大力支持下（特別是外交部給予的協助），香港一直致力爭取海牙會議在港設立區域辦事處。到了2012年4月，相關的努力取得成果，海牙會議常務及政策大會通過在香港成立區域辦事處的建議。",
            "前任律政司司長黃仁龍資深大律師，貼切地將海牙會議的工作比喻為在法律世界中建造橋樑，協助將不同法律體系和傳統的司法管轄區連繫起來。按照這個比喻，在香港設立區域辦事處能令香港成為這個全球法律橋樑網絡的重要樞紐。",
            "往後的路向",
            "香港該如何定位，對塑造香港的未來起著關鍵作用。除努力不懈地維持法治及解決民生問題外，香港定應繼續國際化。我們將進一步接觸及吸引其他享負盛名的國際法律機構來港設立相關區域辦事處或中心，亦會加強推廣香港作為區內爭議解決服務中心，特別是仲裁及調解方面的服務。基於香港現已取得的成果，加上相關持份者的支持，我對這方面的未來發展感到樂觀及充滿希望。",
