            "The Review of Sexual Offences Sub-committee of the Law Reform Commission today (November 1) released a consultation paper making preliminary proposals for the reform of the law concerning sexual offences involving children and persons with mental impairment. These proposals include a uniform age of consent of 16 years in Hong Kong and the creation of a range of new sexual offences involving children and persons with mental impairment which are gender-neutral and provide improved protection to these vulnerable people.",

It covers sexual offences involving children and persons with mental impairment and sexual offences involving abuse of a position of trust. These sexual offences are largely concerned with the protective principle, that is to say, the protection of certain categories of vulnerable persons from sexual abuse or exploitation.\"",

            "The Review of Sexual Offences Sub-committee was formed in 2006 and has since completed a consultation paper and a report on the issue of a register of sex offenders. It has also completed another report recommending the abolition of the common law presumption that a boy under 14 is incapable of sexual intercourse. The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance 2012 was enacted in July 2012 to implement the relevant recommendation. In September 2012, the sub-committee issued a consultation paper on rape and other non-consensual sexual offences, which represents the first of the four consultation papers intended to be issued by the sub-committee on the overall review of the substantive sexual offences.",
