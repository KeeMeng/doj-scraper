            "The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, today (October 31) made the following statement on the announcement of retirement of the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, Mr Geoffrey Ma Tao-li:",
            "I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, Mr Geoffrey Ma Tao-li, for his invaluable contribution to the Judiciary over the years in upholding the judicial independence, enhancing its transparency and service efficiency. Chief Justice Ma is dedicated to perfecting the judicial system of the Special Administrative Region.",
            "As the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, Chief Justice Ma has spared no effort in explaining the way justice is administered in Hong Kong, thereby enhancing the public awareness of our legal system which is the key to its continuing utility and acceptance. Under his leadership, the Court of Final Appeal moved into the old Supreme Court located on Jackson Road in 2015, signifying a milestone in the history of the Judiciary. The completion of the West Kowloon Law Courts Building in 2016 also provided much needed space for the effective operation of courts.",
            "Chief Justice Ma is endeavoured to maintain the best quality judges in the Hong Kong Judiciary. He proposed to extend the retirement ages of judges at all levels of court to retain talents and attract candidates with professional qualities to join the Judiciary. During his tenure, non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions of the Court of Final Appeal are of eminent reputation. The Right Honourable the Baroness Brenda Hale of Richmond and the Right Honourable Beverley McLachlin, PC, are the first two female judges appointed to the Court of Final Appeal. Their appointment marked a historic moment in Hong Kong.",
            "Chief Justice Ma is well respected by the local legal sector and among the international community. He was appointed a Judge of the Court of First Instance of the High Court in 2001, and then appointed a Justice of Appeal of the Court of Appeal of the High Court until he was appointed the Chief Judge of the High Court in 2003 to lead the High Court both judicially and administratively. He also implemented and promoted the Civil Justice Reform. He was subsequently appointed the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal in September 2010. Chief Justice Ma is acknowledged as a model exemplifying the highest standard of professionalism by administering justice in a fair and impartial manner. With his charming personality, Chief Justice Ma is well liked by the legal sector and his colleagues in the Judiciary.",
            "On behalf of the Department of Justice, I convey our sincere appreciation to Chief Justice Ma and wish him a happy retirement.",

            "我衷心感謝終審法院首席法官馬道立多年來在司法機構的竭誠服務，致力捍衞司法獨立，並積極提升司法機構的透明度和服務效率，令特區的司法制度臻於完善。",
            "作為終審法院首席法官，馬道立法官經常向各界講述香港法院秉行公義的情況，讓公眾對法治和法律制度的認識日益加深，這正是法律制度行之有效和深受認同的關鍵所在。在他的領導下，終審法院於二○一五年遷往昃臣道的前最高法院，這是司法機構發展史上意義重大的里程碑，而西九龍法院大樓於二○一六年落成，為法庭提供需求殷切的空間，確保有效運作。",
            "馬道立法官致力確保香港司法機構擁有最優秀的法官，他建議提高各級法院法官的退休年齡以保留傑出人才和吸引專業才能的法律人士加入司法機構。在他任內，終審法院其他普通法適用地區的非常任法官聲譽卓著，其中何熙怡女男爵及麥嘉琳女士更是首兩位獲任命的女性法官，是香港的一個歷史時刻。",
            "馬道立法官在香港及國際法律界備受尊崇，他於二○○一年獲委任為高等法院原訟法庭法官，繼而獲委任為高等法院上訴法庭法官，其後於二○○三年獲委任為高等法院首席法官，主管高等法院的司法及行政事務，推動並落實「民事司法改革制度」，二○一○年九月出任終審法院首席法官。他一直以專業態度、無畏無懼的精神來審理案件，為司法界豎立榜樣。馬道立法官待人和善，深受法律界及司法機構同事的愛戴。",
            "我代表律政司仝人一同向他致以衷心感謝和崇高敬意，並祝願他退休生活愉快。",
