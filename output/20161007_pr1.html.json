            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at a media session at the Hong Kong International Airport today (October 7):",
            "Reporter: (regarding the remarks made by the Thai Prime Minister on the incident)",
            "Secretary for Justice: I think there have been some suggestions to that effect, but it has been subsequently, as I understand, clarified. I think what the Thai Prime Minister said was it was a matter for China. That was the translation. Of course, I, myself, do not understand Thai. I would have to rely on translation. But from what I have seen, there seems to be different translations. As far as I am concerned, I have not been in the position to clarify the differences in translation. But what I am saying just now, is that subsequent to that, as far as I understand, there has been a spokesman of the Thai government and the explanation also covered the point that I just mentioned, namely the position taken by the National Council for Peace and Order, and in that explanation, the two points that I mentioned in Cantonese just now are very clear. Point number one, that the Thai government has confirmed that they have not received any instructions or directions from other countries. Secondly, the National Council for Peace and Order also explained the reasons in some detail as to why they see fit to refuse entry of Mr Wong Chi-fung, and they also make references as to the activities conducted by Mr Wong and also the imminent holding of the second ACD（Asia Cooperation Dialogue) Summit. As I was saying in Cantonese just now, these are the reasons presented by the Thai government. One may have a different view, one may agree, one may disagree. But as I have explained earlier, the right to allow or refuse entry is the right of any sovereign government, any sovereign state. This is something which, whether we agree with the reason, we have to accept that it is a matter which they have the prerogative.",

            "記者：司長，你有沒有向泰國方面了解為甚麼泰國方面不讓黃之鋒入境？如果中國施壓不讓他入境外國的話，算不算干預香港人的出入境自由？",
            "律政司司長：起初這件事發生的時候，特區政府一知道就已經和相關的單位聯絡，包括香港方面的OCMFA（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署）以及泰國駐港領事館等幾方面溝通。起初的時候，消息有些不是完全清楚，包括泰國當地的一些媒體以及一些其他媒體。但大家可能留意到，在十月五日，泰國政府發言人已經就這件事解釋，當地的一個叫National Council for Peace and Order，中文可能翻譯為「全國維持和平秩序委員會」，就這件事解釋過。當中兩個重點，是他們就這件事是沒有收過其他國家的指示；第二，他們也解釋了為何他們認為不適合容許黃之鋒先生入境，當中亦包括提到在九日、十日召開的第二屆ACD（Asia Cooperation Dialogue）高峰會議。這些理由當然大家可以有自己的意見，有人可能會有不同的意見，有人同意，有人不同意，但正如我當日解釋過，每個國家有自己的入境和出境、出入境政策，包括在處理入境時，每個國家自己有權處理，是他們主權範圍內的事，所以我想在現階段來說，這兩點相對上是頗清楚的。",
