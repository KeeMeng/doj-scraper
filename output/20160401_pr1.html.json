            "Following are the speaking notes of the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, tabled at the Finance Committee special meeting in the Legislative Council today (April 1):",
            "Chairman and Members,",
            "For 2016-17, the total estimated expenditure of the Department of Justice (DoJ) is about $2,241 million, which represents an increase of about 29.5 per cent (or around $510 million) over the revised estimated expenditure for the last financial year (i.e. 2015-16), but about 13.2 per cent (or around $260 million) over the original estimated expenditure for the same financial year. Out of this increase, around 9 per cent is due to the filling of vacancies which could not be filled previously, and the net creation of 37 posts to cope with the increasing demand of government departments for legal services. For the remaining part of the increase, it is mostly to cater for the anticipated increase in court costs and expenses which may be payable to barristers, solicitors and other professionals in private practice to be engaged (accounting for around 61 per cent and 30 per cent of the total increase respectively).",
            "The expenditure on court costs and briefing-out expenses depends on the number of cases involved, their complexity and development. The estimated expenditure in this regard for each year is worked out on the basis of information available at the time of preparing the estimates and the principles of prudent management of public finances, but the ultimate actual amount to be incurred eventually will depend on the development and outcome of the judicial proceedings concerned. In view of the number of cases involved, their complexity and development during the year, we have reduced the 2015-16 revised estimates for court costs and briefing-out expenses by 33.8 per cent and 21.8 per cent respectively, to reflect the more realistic development of the cases at that time and the corresponding anticipated expenditure. For this reason, when comparing the 2016-17 estimates with the substantially reduced 2015-16 revised estimates, due to the difference in benchmarks, it may apparently give the impression that there is a significant increase. However, when compared with the 2015-16 original estimates, the anticipated increases in the court costs and briefing-out expenses for 2016-17 are merely 37.8 per cent and 6.9 per cent respectively.",
            "The increase in the estimate for court costs is mainly due to the possible need to make payment of court costs arising from some mega proceedings in 2016-17 (including court costs payment to be rolled over from 2015-16 to 2016-17). However, the ultimate amount required to be paid will depend on the development and outcome of the proceedings concerned.",
            "As regards the increase in the estimate for briefing-out expenses, it is partly due to the anticipated payment of costs that may be incurred in some mega civil proceedings, and including those in respect of the Pilot Scheme for Arbitration on Land Premium ($91.5 million). Besides, we also expect an increase in the standard briefing-out rates for criminal cases. As the fee scale of the Legal Aid Department for criminal legal aid fees as prescribed in the Legal Aid in Criminal Cases Rules as well as duty lawyers’ fees under the Duty Lawyer Scheme will be increased (by 50 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively for the relevant fees), we would also have to raise the standard briefing-out rates for criminal cases. This is to ensure that both the defence and the prosecution would have an equal opportunity to obtain legal representation of comparable quality. We will strive to exercise maximum prudence in controlling the expenditure on court costs and briefing-out expenses, subject to the overriding principle that service quality should not be compromised.",
            "I will now outline the DoJ's major areas of work in the new financial year.",
            "In the context of criminal prosecutions, we anticipate another busy year in 2016-17. In addition to the handling of various types of routine criminal cases, cases arising from the \"Occupy Movement\" and the earlier Mong Kok incident will form a considerable portion of the work of the Prosecutions Division this year. Colleagues of the Prosecutions Division will continue to process each and every case in a fair and impartial manner according to the prosecution policy and the applicable law. To strengthen support for handling cases related to, inter alia, public order events, resources will be provided starting from 2016-17 for the creation of one additional Senior Government Counsel post in the Prosecutions Division. We will also make suitable manpower arrangements or, where necessary, engage barristers or solicitors in private practice so as to effectively manage our prosecution work.",
            "We will also continue to organise events such as \"Meet the Community\" and \"Prosecution Week\", so as to enhance public understanding of the criminal justice system of Hong Kong and to promote public awareness of the rule of law through various types of activities.",
            "The Civil Division will continue to provide services in civil law matters to all government departments. Among the matters handled, the number of judicial review proceedings involving the Government has been increasing in recent years (amounting to a total of 118 cases in 2013, 152 in 2014 and rising to 178 cases in total in 2015). The regime of judicial review is an important safeguard to the rule of law under the common law system. The DoJ respects the rights which Article 35 of the Basic Law confers on Hong Kong residents and will continue to handle relevant proceedings in accordance with judicial procedures, while being mindful of the views of the community on the judicial review regime, with a view to upholding the rule of law while enhancing governance.",
            "Regarding the promotion of mediation, the Mediation Team takes forward various initiatives, including: working on the introduction of apology legislation; continuing to monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of the Mediation Ordinance; and monitoring the work of the industry-led Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association Limited (HKMAAL). In May this year, a Mediation Week will again be held to help the development of mediation services in Hong Kong.",
            "On the other hand, the Legal Policy Division, in discharging the important function to uphold the rule of law, will continue to provide legal support to different departments of the government on Basic Law, human rights and constitutional matters.",
            "Over the years, the DoJ has striven to enhance Hong Kong's status as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region. We are delighted that the National 13th Five-Year Plan recently announced clearly supports this direction of development. We will continue to work with all stakeholders to promote Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services in the Mainland and overseas (covering countries along the Belt and Road route), including the organisation in the latter half of this year of the fourth biennial Hong Kong Legal Services Forum in Nanjing.",
            "Facing the increasingly competitive environment within and outside the region, we plan to create one post of Deputy Principal Government Counsel in this financial year to be responsible for the related work. The proposal has been endorsed by the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services, and will be submitted to the Establishment Subcommittee of the Finance Committee for consideration in due course. For this, we look forward to Members' support.",
            "The goal of the Law Drafting Division includes ensuring that our bilingual legislation should be clear, accurate and user-friendly. The Law Draftsman who has recently joined the DoJ has extensive experience, and I believe she can provide new impetus to this work area within the DoJ.",
            "The current term of the Legislative Council will end during the 2016-17 financial year. Before the current Council is prorogued, it will scrutinise many bills. While the Bills are under scrutiny, the Law Drafting Division will provide professional assistance to the policy bureaux.",
            "The International Law Division has been active in participating in the activities and conferences of international legal and related organisations, and in strengthening mutual co-operation. Such efforts include participation in a sub-group on strengthening economic and legal infrastructure established under the Economic Committee of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), to showcase the strength of Hong Kong as an international legal services and dispute resolution centre to emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific Region. Recently, taking the opportunity of the APEC meetings held in Peru this February, the DoJ conducted a workshop in collaboration with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), during which the Secretary of UNCITRAL, experts of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, as well as representatives of the Hong Kong legal profession shared their experiences with participants of the workshop.",
            "Moreover, during its review in March this year, the Council on General Affairs and Policy of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) resolved to maintain the HCCH's Asia Pacific Regional Office in Hong Kong, and was also appreciative of the fruits of the co-operation between the HKSAR Government and the office over the past three years. This decision again reflects the importance that HCCH attaches to Hong Kong as a regional legal services centre, and also contributes to enhancing the profile of Hong Kong in the international legal community. We will continue with our efforts in promoting co-operation with international and regional legal and related organisations.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Chairman, the above is an outline of the major areas of work of the DoJ in the coming financial year. My colleagues and I will be pleased to answer Members' questions and listen to your views. Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師提交予今日（四月一日）的立法會財務委員會特別會議的書面發言稿件全文︰",
            "主席、各位委員：",
            "律政司在二○一六至一七年度的總預算開支約為22億4千100萬元，較上年度（即二○一五至一六年度）的修訂預算開支增加約29.5%（即大約5億1千萬元），但較上年度的原來預算開支則增加約13.2%（即大約2億6千萬元）。預算開支上升，當中約9%是由於填補過去未能填補的職位空缺，以及淨計增設37個新職位以應付各政府部門對法律服務需求的增長；其餘大部分開支上升是因為我們預期訴訟費用及向獲委聘的私人執業大律師、律師及其他專業人士支付的開支會有所增加（分別佔總升幅約61%及30%）。",
            "訴訟費用及外判案件的開支金額，是視乎相關案件的數目、複雜程度和進展而定。每年這方面的開支預算，是根據擬備預算時所知的資料及審慎理財的理念制訂，但最後實際金額則取決於相關司法程序的發展和結果。鑑於有關案件的數目、複雜程度和年內的實際進展，我們將二○一五至一六年訴訟費用及外判案件開支的修訂預算分別調低33.8%及21.8%，以反映當時有關案件較實際發展及相應預計開支需求。因此，若將二○一六至一七年的預算，與二○一五至一六年大幅調低的修訂預算作比較時，由於基準不同，表面上可能會導致有大幅上升的感覺。但若與二○一五至一六年度的原來預算作比較，二○一六至一七年度訴訟費用及外判案件開支的預算升幅僅為37.8%及6.9%。",
            "訟費開支預算增加，主要是估計若干大型訴訟有可能需要在二○一六至一七年度支付訴訟費用（包括由二○一五至一六年延至二○一六至一七年需支付的訟費），但最終需要支付的金額將取決於有關訴訟的發展和結果。",
            "至於外判案件開支預算增加，部分原因是估計可能需要支付若干大型民事訟案的費用，以及包括有關補地價仲裁先導計劃可能涉及的開支（9,150萬元）。此外，我們亦預期外判刑事案件的標準費用款額將會調升。由於法律援助署根據《刑事案件法律援助規則》所訂明的刑事法律援助費用收費表，以及當值律師計劃下當值律師的收費均會調高（相關費用的升幅分別約為50%及7.7%），我們必須同時提高相關的外判刑事案件的標準費用，從而確保控辯雙方都得到質素相對稱的法律代表機會。我們會在不影響服務質素的大前提下，盡量謹慎控制訴訟費用及外判案件開支。",
            "以下我會簡介律政司在新一個財政年度的工作重點。",
            "在刑事檢控方面，我們預計二○一六至一七年度會繼續是忙碌的一年。除處理日常不同種類的刑事案件外，「佔領行動」及早前旺角事件衍生的相關案件，將會佔刑事檢控科今年工作的相當部分。刑事檢控科的同事會繼續根據檢控政策及適用法律，以公平、公正的態度處理每宗案件。為加強支援以處理包括與公眾秩序活動有關的案件，我們會在二○一六至一七年度起提供資源，在刑事檢控科增設一個高級政府律師職位。我們亦會適當地安排人手，或在有需要時委聘私人執業大律師或律師，以便有效處理檢控工作。",
            "我們亦會繼續舉辦「與公眾會面」及「檢控週」等活動，希望透過不同形式的活動，加強公眾理解香港的刑事制度及推廣法治精神。",
            "民事法律科會繼續向政府各部門提供民事法律服務。其中，涉及政府的司法覆核個案數字，在近年一直上升（二○一三年合共118宗，二○一四年合共152宗，二○一五年則上升至178宗）。司法覆核機制是普通法制度下維護法治的重要一環。律政司尊重《基本法》第35條賦予香港居民的權利，會繼續依據司法程序處理相關訴訟，亦會留意社會對司法覆核機制所提出的意見，務求能夠同時維護法治及完善管治。",
            "在推廣調解的工作方面，調解小組將推展多項工作，包括推進訂立道歉法例的工作、繼續監察《調解條例》的實施成效，以及監察由業界主導的香港調解資歷評審協會有限公司的工作。今年五月將會再次舉辦「調解週」，藉此推動香港調解服務的發展。",
            "另一方面，法律政策科會繼續發揮維護法治的重要職能，就《基本法》、人權及政制等事宜，向政府不同部門提供相關法律支援。",
            "律政司多年來致力鞏固香港作為亞太區的國際法律及解決爭議服務中心。我們十分高興國家在最近公布的「十三五」規劃中明確支持這發展方向。我們會繼續與所有持份者合作，在內地與海外（包括「一帶一路」沿線國家）推廣香港的法律及解決爭議服務，包括於本年下半年在南京舉行第四屆「香港法律服務論壇」。",
            "面對區內、區外競爭日益激烈的環境，我們計劃在本財政年度開設一個副首席政府律師職位，專責相關工作。有關建議已獲司法及法律事務委員會支持，稍後將提交財務委員會轄下人事編制小組委員會審議，希望得到各委員支持。",
            "法律草擬科的工作目標，包括務求雙語法例清晰準確，便於閱覽。新加入律政司的法律草擬專員有豐富的經驗，我相信能夠為律政司這方面的工作引入新動力。",
            "在二○一六至一七財政年度，立法會現屆任期將會結束，在休會之前，立法會將會審議多項法案。法律草擬科將在審議過程中，向政策局提供專業支援。",
            "國際法律科一直積極參與法律及相關國際組織的活動和會議，並加強彼此的合作。當中包括參與亞太經合組織（APEC）經濟委員會下一個加強經濟和法律基建工作組，讓亞太區的新興經濟體系更加認識香港作為國際法律和解決爭議服務中心的優勢。最近，適逢亞太經合組織二月份於秘魯舉行會議，律政司與聯合國國際貿易法委員會（貿法委）合辦工作坊，期間貿法委秘書長、常設仲裁法院的專家，以及香港法律界代表與工作坊的參與者分享經驗。",
            "此外，海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）常務和政策大會於今年三月的檢討中，決定維持在香港的亞太區域辦事處，亦感謝特區政府與該辦事處在過去三年的合作成果。這決定再次反映海牙會議對香港作為區域法律服務中心的重視，亦有助提升香港在國際法律界的形象。我們會繼續致力推動與國際及區域性的法律及相關組織的合作。",
            "結語",
            "主席，以上是律政司在新的財政年度的主要工作。我和各同事會樂意解答各位委員的問題和聽取大家的意見。多謝各位。",

            "主席、各位委員：",
            "律政司在二○一六至一七年度的總預算開支約為22億4千100萬元，較上年度（即二○一五至一六年度）的修訂預算開支增加約29.5%（即大約5億1千萬元），但較上年度的原來預算開支則增加約13.2%（即大約2億6千萬元）",
            "預算開支上升，當中約9%是由於填補過去未能填補的職位空缺，以及淨計增設37個新職位以應付各政府部門對法律服務需求的增長；其餘大部分開支上升是因為我們預期訴訟費用及向獲委聘的私人執業大律師、律師及其他專業人士支付的開支會有所增加（分別佔總升幅約61%及30%）",

            "訟費開支預算增加，主要是估計若干大型訴訟有可能需要在二○一六至一七年度支付訴訟費用（包括由二○一五至一六年延至二○一六至一七年需支付的訟費），但最終需要支付的金額將取決於有關訴訟的發展和結果",
            "至於外判案件開支預算增加，部分原因是估計可能需要支付若干大型民事訟案的費用，以及包括有關補地價仲裁先導計劃可能涉及的開支（9,150萬元）",
            "此外，我們亦預期外判刑事案件的標準費用款額將會調升",
            "由於法律援助署根據《刑事案件法律援助規則》所訂明的刑事法律援助費用收費表，以及當值律師計劃下當值律師的收費均會調高（相關費用的升幅分別約為50%及7.7%），我們必須同時提高相關的外判刑事案件的標準費用，從而確保控辯雙方都得到質素相對稱的法律代表機會",
            "我們會在不影響服務質素的大前提下，盡量謹慎控制訴訟費用及外判案件開支",
            "以下我會簡介律政司在新一個財政年度的工作重點",
            "在刑事檢控方面，我們預計二○一六至一七年度會繼續是忙碌的一年",
            "除處理日常不同種類的刑事案件外，「佔領行動」及早前旺角事件衍生的相關案件，將會佔刑事檢控科今年工作的相當部分",
            "刑事檢控科的同事會繼續根據檢控政策及適用法律，以公平、公正的態度處理每宗案件",
            "為加強支援以處理包括與公眾秩序活動有關的案件，我們會在二○一六至一七年度起提供資源，在刑事檢控科增設一個高級政府律師職位",
            "我們亦會適當地安排人手，或在有需要時委聘私人執業大律師或律師，以便有效處理檢控工作",
            "我們亦會繼續舉辦「與公眾會面」及「檢控週」等活動，希望透過不同形式的活動，加強公眾理解香港的刑事制度及推廣法治精神",
            "民事法律科會繼續向政府各部門提供民事法律服務",
            "其中，涉及政府的司法覆核個案數字，在近年一直上升（二○一三年合共118宗，二○一四年合共152宗，二○一五年則上升至178宗）",
            "司法覆核機制是普通法制度下維護法治的重要一環",
            "律政司尊重《基本法》第35條賦予香港居民的權利，會繼續依據司法程序處理相關訴訟，亦會留意社會對司法覆核機制所提出的意見，務求能夠同時維護法治及完善管治",
            "在推廣調解的工作方面，調解小組將推展多項工作，包括推進訂立道歉法例的工作、繼續監察《調解條例》的實施成效，以及監察由業界主導的香港調解資歷評審協會有限公司的工作",
            "今年五月將會再次舉辦「調解週」，藉此推動香港調解服務的發展",
            "另一方面，法律政策科會繼續發揮維護法治的重要職能，就《基本法》、人權及政制等事宜，向政府不同部門提供相關法律支援",
            "律政司多年來致力鞏固香港作為亞太區的國際法律及解決爭議服務中心",
            "我們十分高興國家在最近公布的「十三五」規劃中明確支持這發展方向",
            "我們會繼續與所有持份者合作，在內地與海外（包括「一帶一路」沿線國家）推廣香港的法律及解決爭議服務，包括於本年下半年在南京舉行第四屆「香港法律服務論壇」",
            "面對區內、區外競爭日益激烈的環境，我們計劃在本財政年度開設一個副首席政府律師職位，專責相關工作",
            "有關建議已獲司法及法律事務委員會支持，稍後將提交財務委員會轄下人事編制小組委員會審議，希望得到各委員支持",
            "法律草擬科的工作目標，包括務求雙語法例清晰準確，便於閱覽",
            "新加入律政司的法律草擬專員有豐富的經驗，我相信能夠為律政司這方面的工作引入新動力",
            "在二○一六至一七財政年度，立法會現屆任期將會結束，在休會之前，立法會將會審議多項法案",
            "法律草擬科將在審議過程中，向政策局提供專業支援",
            "國際法律科一直積極參與法律及相關國際組織的活動和會議，並加強彼此的合作",
            "當中包括參與亞太經合組織（APEC）經濟委員會下一個加強經濟和法律基建工作組，讓亞太區的新興經濟體系更加認識香港作為國際法律和解決爭議服務中心的優勢",
            "最近，適逢亞太經合組織二月份於秘魯舉行會議，律政司與聯合國國際貿易法委員會（貿法委）合辦工作坊，期間貿法委秘書長、常設仲裁法院的專家，以及香港法律界代表與工作坊的參與者分享經驗",
            "此外，海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）常務和政策大會於今年三月的檢討中，決定維持在香港的亞太區域辦事處，亦感謝特區政府與該辦事處在過去三年的合作成果",
            "這決定再次反映海牙會議對香港作為區域法律服務中心的重視，亦有助提升香港在國際法律界的形象",
            "我們會繼續致力推動與國際及區域性的法律及相關組織的合作",
            "結語",
            "主席，以上是律政司在新的財政年度的主要工作",
            "我和各同事會樂意解答各位委員的問題和聽取大家的意見",
            "多謝各位",
