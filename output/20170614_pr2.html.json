            "Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, on the resumption of the Second Reading debate on the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2016 in the Legislative Council meeting today (June 14):",
            "President,",
            "The Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been examined in detail by the Bills Committee chaired by the Hon Martin Liao. I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Hon Martin Liao and all other members of the Bills Committee for their hard work in scrutinising the Bill. I would also like to express my gratitude to the relevant bodies for their valuable opinions and support.",
            "The main objective of the Bill is to amend the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609) (the Ordinance) so as to clarify that disputes over intellectual property rights (IPR disputes) can be resolved through arbitration and that it is not contrary to the public policy of Hong Kong to enforce arbitral awards involving IPRs. The Bill also proposes to amend the Schedule to the Arbitration (Parties to New York Convention) Order (Cap. 609A) to update the list of parties to the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the New York Convention).",
            "As I pointed out when introducing the Bill into this Council last December, the Ordinance presently does not have any specific provision dealing with the arbitrability of IPR disputes and there is no authoritative judgment in Hong Kong on the subject. We believe that the amendments on arbitrability of IPR disputes will help attract more parties to resolve their IPR disputes through arbitration in Hong Kong and facilitate the enforcement of related arbitral awards in Hong Kong.",
            "Confidentiality of arbitration process and of arbitral awards",
            "During discussion of the Bills Committee, some members raised the question of whether confidentiality of arbitration process and of arbitral awards would give rise to competition concerns. The Government has since explained in detail the relevant issues to the Bills Committee, taking into full account the views of members of the Bills Committee, stakeholders and the Competition Commission of Hong Kong.",
            "In short, the Competition Commission agrees that the Bill and its implications on the arbitration process are \"competition neutral\", and that confidentiality of arbitration is unlikely by itself to be inconsistent with the Competition Ordinance (Cap. 619). Moreover, it also considers that the Bill is consistent with the Competition Ordinance from an enforcement perspective. I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate that the Bill seeks to amend the Ordinance so as to clarify that IPR disputes can be resolved through arbitration for the purposes of facilitating the conduct of intellectual property (IP) arbitration and the enforcement of related arbitral awards in Hong Kong. The Bill does not seek to alter the substantive legal rights of the parties to any arbitration or any third parties, the position of competition law in Hong Kong, or the power of the courts or competition authorities in relation to competition issues under the laws of Hong Kong.",
            "Since confidentiality of arbitration is not by itself anti-competitive, whether disclosure or recordal of IPR arbitral awards should be required must be considered carefully in light of relevant wider public policy considerations. These include: first, the importance of confidentiality in Hong Kong's arbitration regime. Confidentiality is, whether locally or internationally, often one of the key reasons why parties prefer to use arbitration (as opposed to court litigation) to resolve disputes. In the case of Hong Kong, such confidentiality is expressly provided for in section 18 of the Ordinance. Any erosion of confidentiality may prejudice Hong Kong's position as a leading international arbitration centre.",
            "Second, arbitral awards, in general, only have inter partes effect, which means that the legal rights of third parties will not be affected. There are safeguards for third party interests under the existing arbitration and legal regimes. Third parties may also seek to protect their interests by conducting investigation or due diligence or by negotiating suitable contractual provisions. Further, we have considered the practice of 30 jurisdictions. Based on our survey, we note that the general practice in these jurisdictions is that mandatory disclosure or recordal of IPR arbitral awards with inter partes effect is not required. Having taken into account all relevant factors, the Government considers it not necessary or appropriate to require mandatory disclosure of IPR arbitral awards or their recordal with IPR registries in Hong Kong.",
            "Committee Stage Amendments",
            "President, I shall be moving a number of Committee Stage Amendments (CSAs) later. The Bills Committee has examined the proposed CSAs and did not raise any objections. I shall briefly explain the proposed CSAs as follows.",
            "Clauses 1(3) and 7 of the Bill",
            "According to clause 1(3) of the Bill, the amendments concerning IP arbitration (i.e. Part 2 of the Bill (except the new section 103J)) are to come into operation on October 1, 2017, rather than on the day of publication of the Amendment Ordinance in the Gazette (Note). The underlying policy intent of this deferred commencement provision as originally drafted is to allow the IP arbitration community a period of around six months after the passage of the Bill to prepare for commencement of the relevant amendments. To give effect to this policy intent, I will move CSAs to clause 1(3) and related CSAs to clause 7 of the Bill to the effect that the relevant amendments will commence on the first day of the seventh month immediately following the month in which the Amendment Ordinance is published in the Gazette. In other words, if the Amendment Ordinance is passed by the Council and gazetted within this month (i.e. June 2017), the above-mentioned legislative amendments relating to IP arbitration will come into operation on January 1, 2018.",
            "Clause 9(2) of the Bill",
            "Separately, since the Government introduced the Bill, Angola has recently acceded to the New York Convention with effect from June 4, 2017. Therefore, I will move another CSA to amend clause 9(2) of the Bill in order to add Angola to the Schedule to the Arbitration (Parties to New York Convention) Order. By virtue of clause 1(2) of the Bill, the relevant amendment will come into operation on the day of gazettal.",
            "Conclusion",
            "The established policy of the Department of Justice is to encourage the use of arbitration to resolve civil and commercial disputes. To further consolidate Hong Kong's status as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, the Department of Justice has been reviewing the arbitration regime of Hong Kong from time to time and will also consider improvement to the Ordinance. The Government believes that the relevant amendments to the Bill will further consolidate Hong Kong's competitiveness as a leading international arbitration centre and reinforce Hong Kong's edge over other jurisdictions in the region in resolving IP disputes.",
            "Mr President, with these remarks, I urge Members to support the Second Reading of the Bill and the amendments that I will move at the subsequent Committee Stage.",
            "Thank you, President.",
            "Note: Clause 1(2) of the Bill.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月十四日）在立法會會議上動議恢復二讀辯論《2016年仲裁（修訂）條例草案》的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "主席:",
            "由廖長江議員擔任主席的法案委員會已詳細審議《2016年仲裁（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。我謹此感謝廖長江議員及其他委員的努力，令《條例草案》的審議工作順利完成。我亦希望向提供寶貴意見和支持的各有關團體表達謝意。",
            "《條例草案》的主要目的，是修訂《仲裁條例》（第609章），以澄清知識產權爭議可透過仲裁解決，以及澄清強制執行涉及知識產權的仲裁裁決，並不違反香港的公共政策。《條例草案》亦擬修訂《仲裁（紐約公約締約方）令》（第609章，附屬法例A）的附表，以更新一九五八年《承認及執行外國仲裁裁決公約》（簡稱《紐約公約》）的締約方名單。",
            "正如我去年十二月向本會提交《條例草案》時指出，《仲裁條例》現時並無針對知識產權爭議可否透過仲裁解決的具體條文，而香港亦沒有相關的權威性判例。我們相信就知識產權爭議可仲裁性的修訂將有助吸引更多當事人在香港透過仲裁解決知識產權爭議，以及便利在香港強制執行相關仲裁裁決。",
            "仲裁程序及仲裁裁決的保密性",
            "在法案委員會的討論過程中，有議員提出仲裁程序及仲裁裁決的保密性會否引起競爭問題。在全面考慮法案委員會的委員、持份者及香港競爭事務委員會（競委會）的意見後，政府已向法案委員會詳細解釋相關問題。",
            "簡言之，競委會同意《條例草案》及其對仲裁程序的影響屬「競爭中立」，而仲裁的保密性本身不大可能與《競爭條例》（第619章）有衝突。競委會亦認為從執法角度而言，《條例草案》與《競爭條例》之間不存在矛盾。我謹此重申，《條例草案》旨在修訂《仲裁條例》，以釐清知識產權爭議可透過仲裁解決，從而便利進行知識產權仲裁和強制執行有關仲裁裁決。《條例草案》並不尋求改變仲裁當事人或第三方的實質法律權益、香港競爭法律的狀況，或法院或競爭主管當局就競爭事宜在香港法律下的權力。",
            "由於仲裁的保密性本身並非反競爭，對於應否要求將知識產權仲裁裁決披露或登錄，有必要慎重考慮更廣泛的相關公共政策因素，當中包括：第一，保密性在香港仲裁制度的重要性。不論在本地或國際層面，仲裁保密性往往是當事方傾向選擇以仲裁（而非法院訴訟）解決爭議的其中一個重要原因。在香港，《仲裁條例》第18條更就仲裁的保密性作出明文規定。對保密性的任何損害均可能影響香港作為主要國際仲裁中心的地位。",
            "第二，仲裁裁決一般只對仲裁各方具有效力，不影響第三者的法律權利。現行的仲裁和法律制度中存在着保障第三方權益的措施，第三方亦可透過進行調查或盡職審查，或透過商談適當的合約條款以保障他們的權益。再者，我們亦參考了30個司法管轄區的做法。這些司法管轄區的一般做法，並不強制要求將只對仲裁各方具有效力的知識產權仲裁裁決進行披露或登錄。在考慮所有相關因素後，政府認為無須亦不應要求將知識產權仲裁裁決強制披露或在香港的知識產權註冊處進行登錄。",
            "全體委員會審議階段修正案",
            "主席，我稍後會在全體委員會審議階段動議數項修正案。法案委員會已審議擬議的修正案，亦無提出異議。我現在對擬議的修正案作簡單介紹。",
            "《條例草案》第1（3）及第7條",
            "根據《條例草案》第1（3）條，關於知識產權仲裁的修訂（即《條例草案》第2部（新訂的第103J條除外）），原定於二○一七年十月一日起實施，而非於《修訂條例》刊憲當日起實施（註）。這項延遲生效條款的政策原意是讓知識產權仲裁界在《條例草案》通過後有大約六個月時間，為有關修訂的生效做好準備。為貫徹這個政策意向，我將就《條例草案》第1（3）條動議修正案，並就《條例草案》第7條動議相關的修正案，使有關修訂在緊接《修訂條例》於憲報刊登的月份之後的第七個月的首日起實施。換言之，如《修訂條例》獲議會通過，並於本月（六月）內刊憲，上述有關知識產權仲裁的法例修訂將於二○一八年一月一日起生效。",
            "《條例草案》第9（2）條",
            "此外，自政府提出《條例草案》後，安哥拉最近已加入《紐約公約》，並於二○一七年六月四日起生效。因此，我將就《條例草案》第9（2）條動議另一修正案，將安哥拉加入《仲裁（紐約公約締約方）令》的附表。根據《條例草案》第1（2）條，有關修訂將於《修訂條例》刊憲當日起實施。",
            "結語",
            "律政司的既定政策是鼓勵當事人透過仲裁去解決民商事爭議。為進一步鞏固香港作為亞太區主要的國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位，律政司不時檢討香港的仲裁制度，並對《仲裁條例》作出改善。政府相信《條例草案》的有關修訂將進一步鞏固香港作為主要國際仲裁中心的競爭力，並強化香港較區內其他司法管轄區在解決知識產權爭議方面的優勢。",
            "主席，我謹此陳辭，懇請各位議員支持通過二讀《條例草案》，以及我稍後在委員會審議階段動議的各項修正案。",
