            "The following is issued on behalf of the Law Reform Commission:",
            "The Access to Information Sub-committee of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) is inviting public views on whether reform of the current regime of public access to information held by the Government is needed, and if so, what kind of reform is preferred.",
            "Releasing the consultation paper in a press conference today (December 6), the Chairman of the Access to Information Sub-committee, Mr Russell Coleman, SC, said that the Sub-committee’s provisional views are that although the existing Code on Access to Information (the Code) is effective and cost-efficient, legislation should be introduced to implement an access to information regime with statutory backing.",
            "At present, access to government-held information is based on an administrative regime set out in the Code, which has been in operation since 1995.",
            "In deciding the key features of the proposed access to information regime, the Sub-committee has studied the law and practice of relevant common law jurisdictions, and found that the public's need to obtain more information about public bodies should be balanced with other types of rights including privacy and data-protection rights, and third-party rights.",
            "\"The proposed legislative regime would have exempt information categorised into absolute and qualified exemptions, like most common law jurisdictions,\" said Mr Coleman.",
            "The Access to Information Sub-committee tentatively recommends to adopt as absolute exemptions the following categories of information:",
            "As for qualified exemptions, a public body has to balance the public interest for and against disclosure. The Sub-committee tentatively recommends to adopt as qualified exemptions the following categories of information:",
            "It is also the Sub-committee's tentative recommendation that the proposed regime should have certain review and appeal stages. The first stage is internal review of the decision by preferably another officer or officer of a higher rank. The second stage is review by the Office of the Ombudsman. If the applicant is not satisfied, he can proceed to the third stage of appeal to the Court.",
            "The recommendations include a proposed offence of altering or erasing records to prevent disclosure. \"Where a request for information has been made to a public body, it should be an offence to alter, erase, destroy or conceal records with intent to prevent disclosure of records or information. However, any failure on the part of a public body to comply with a duty should not confer any right of action in civil proceedings,\" said Mr Coleman.",
            "Mr Coleman added that the provisional views expressed in the consultation paper are intended to facilitate discussion and do not necessarily represent the Sub-committee’s final conclusions. The Sub-committee would welcome views, comments and suggestions on any issues discussed in the consultation paper.",
            "All views should be submitted on or before March 5, 2019 to: The Secretary, Access to Information Sub-committee, LRC (4/F, Justice Place, East Wing, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central, Hong Kong) by mail, by fax (3918 4096) or by e-mail (",

            "公開資料小組委員會主席高浩文資深大律師於今日（十二月六日）舉行的記者會上發表諮詢文件，並表示小組委員會的初步看法是，雖然現行的《公開資料守則》（《守則》）有效及符合成本效益，但亦應該通過立法實施具有法定地位的公開資料制度。",
            "現時，公開政府所持資料乃按照《守則》所載的行政安排進行，而《守則》由一九九五年起開始運作。",
            "為了決定建議中公開資料機制的主要特點，小組委員會研究過有關普通法司法管轄區的法律和作業方法，發現公眾獲取更多公共機構資料的需要，應該與其他種類的權利取得平衡，該等權利包括私隱權、資料保障權及第三者權利。",

            "建議中包括一項擬議的更改或删除檔案以阻止披露罪行。高浩文說：「在有人向公共機構提出索取資料要求後，更改、刪除、銷毀或隱藏檔案，意圖阻止披露檔案或資料，應訂為罪行。然而，在公共機構未有履行其責任的情況，並不賦予任何人循民事法律程序提起訴訟的權利。」",
