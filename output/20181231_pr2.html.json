            "The Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice today (December 31) released its annual report, \"Prosecutions Hong Kong 2017\", which reviews the division's work and important cases last year. In his letter presenting the report to the Secretary for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr David Leung, SC, highlighted one of the most important guiding principles for the division's prosecutors: \"As ministers of justice, we are dedicated to upholding the rule of law by conducting criminal prosecutions free from any interference. The responsibilities that we take up are heavy, the challenges and criticisms that we face are immense, but we have and shall continue to uphold the rule of law with professionalism, independence, and transparency.\"",
            "In the Director's Overview, Mr Leung made clear his goal to enable prosecutors in the division to gain more exposure in court work and to enhance their advocacy skills. He also further elaborated on the key challenges for the division in 2017. For cases related to the Occupy Central Movement and incidents in Mong Kok involving violence in February 2016, as in any other case, \"prosecutors…considered the decision of whether to prosecute and if so, the appropriate charge(s) purely on the available evidence and the principles set out in the Prosecution Code – nothing else,\" Mr Leung said. In respect of the review of sentences cases, he reiterated that \"prosecutors only conduct review of sentences in the rarest of cases.\"",
            "As to the continuing verbal abuses of prosecutors, Mr Leung emphasised that \"while prosecutors are not immune from criticisms, they and their family members should not become victims of such unwarranted abuses. Prosecutors conduct criminal prosecutions not because of their personal interests. They do so on behalf of the public as ministers of justice….\" And noting attacks on the presiding judges when the outcome of the cases with a political background do not tally with their expectation, Mr Leung stressed that \"the public should have confidence in the judicial system and judicial officers of Hong Kong and refrain from lodging baseless attacks on judges.\"",
            "Apart from the key challenges, Mr Leung also set out in the Director's Overview the important achievements made in 2017. Firstly, various measures were taken to strengthen the prosecution services at the magistracy level. Secondly, in May 2017, the Department of Justice organised the Criminal Law Conference in partnership with the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong. Thirdly, the division continued to actively reach out to its partners and the community by organising events such as the Prosecution Week and the \"Meet the Community\" Programme.",
            "Apart from a detailed account of the main activities of and key cases handled by the different sub-divisions and units of the Prosecutions Division, this latest review also provides information on various trainings as well as conferences, both locally and internationally, in which prosecutors participated during the year.",
            "The review also contains two feature articles – one on \"Anguish and Joy as DPP\" and the other on \"Surviving Practice as a Criminal Lawyer\". For the former, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, shared his thoughts and feelings during his term as the Director of Public Prosecutions. For the latter, Mr Jonathan Caplan, QC, sets out his various reflections on his practice as a barrister over the last 25 years in both the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.",

            "刑事檢控專員梁卓然資深大律師在向律政司司長提交該年報的信件中，特別指出其中一項規範刑事檢控科檢控人員的最重要原則：「我們身為秉行公義者，在進行刑事檢控時，持正至公，不受干擾，致力維護法治。我們肩負重任，即使面對重重挑戰，種種責難，仍會一如既往，以專業獨立、開誠布公的精神，捍衞法治。」",
            "梁卓然在年報的序言中，明確地表達了他所訂立的目標，是讓該科檢控人員汲取更多法庭檢控工作的經驗，並提升他們的訟辯技巧。他還進一步闡述了刑事檢控科在二○一七年所面對的主要挑戰。在涉及佔領中環行動及二○一六年二月在旺角發生的暴亂事件，一如其他的案件，梁卓然說：「……檢控人員純粹基於所取得的證據及《檢控守則》的原則決定是否提出檢控，如提出檢控，又決定控以甚麼合適的控罪，箇中絕無其他因素左右。」關於判刑覆核的案件，他重申：「檢控人員只會在非常罕見的情況下申請判刑覆核。」",
            "有關檢控人員持續遭受言論攻擊，梁卓然強調：「檢控人員固然並非可免受批評，但他們個人及家人絕對不應該成為受害人，受到無的放矢的謾罵攻擊。檢控人員肩負刑事檢控工作非為個人利益，而是代公眾擔當『秉行公義者』的角色……」此外，關注到當帶有政治背景的案件的裁決結果與公眾人士的期望不符時，有主審法官受到攻擊，梁卓然強調：「公眾應對香港司法制度及司法人員抱有信心，避免對法官作出毫無事實基礎的攻擊。」",
            "除主要挑戰外，梁卓然亦在年報的序言中敍述了在二○一七年取得的重要成果。第一，採取不同措施以加強裁判法院的檢控服務。第二，於二○一七年五月，律政司聯同香港大律師公會及香港律師會合辦刑事法律研討會。第三，刑事檢控科亦通過舉辦各種活動，如檢控週和「與公眾會面」計劃等，繼續積極與其合作夥伴及社會大眾保持聯繫。",
            "這份最新的年報除詳述刑事檢控科不同分科及小組的主要工作和所處理的重要案件外，也提供有關檢控人員年內在本地及海外參加的各項培訓及會議的資訊。",
            "這份年報亦載有兩篇專題特稿，一篇為「刑事檢控專員的苦與甘」，而另一篇為「刑事法律師求存之道」。在前者中，楊家雄資深大律師分享了他擔任刑事檢控專員期間的一些想法和感受。而在後者中，御用大律師Jonathan Caplan敍述了他在過去二十五年，於英國和香港從事大律師工作的所見所感。",
