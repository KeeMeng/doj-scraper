            "The Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice today (December 30) released its annual report, \"Prosecutions Hong Kong 2015\", which reviews the division's work and important cases last year.",
            "In the Director's Overview, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, elaborated on the key challenges for the division in 2015. He said besides the heavy caseload, during the year, the division faced a more difficult and fundamental challenge related to the controversial nature of the increasing number of cases that it handled, and the act of certain members of the public lashing out in court proceedings. In this regard, Mr Yeung emphasised that the division approached all cases apolitically and respected differences in opinion. \"We realise, against such a background, that it has become all the more important that prosecutors must be able to stand firm and continue to perform their role faithfully as 'minister of justice', with pride, and with our heads up\", Mr Yeung added.",
            "In his letter presenting the report to the Secretary for Justice, Mr Yeung summarised the performance of the division's prosecutors during the period, \"[O]ur prosecutors have discharged their duties in a most professional manner, demonstrating integrity, impartiality and independence, as well as a great dedication to the pursuit of justice. They stood up to challenges in difficult times, firmly and faithfully performing their important role as ministers of justice to assist the courts in the search for truth and justice according to law.\"",
            "It was also reported that all the four Deputy Directors of the division were appointed as Senior Counsel in 2015 (Mr William Tam, Mr David Leung and Mr Martin Hui) and 2016 (Miss Anna Lai) respectively. In this regard, Mr Yeung said, \"I am extremely pleased to see the work of our senior prosecutors being recognised by the Judiciary and the legal profession at large ... This is not only a reflection of their personal achievements, but also a testimony to the width and depth of expertise that the Prosecutions Division possesses in recent years.\"",
            "Apart from a detailed account of the main activities of and key cases handled by the different sub-divisions and units of the Prosecutions Division, this latest review also provides information on various trainings as well as conferences, both locally and internationally, in which prosecutors participated during the year. Moreover, the division also continued to actively reach out to its partners and the community by organising events such as the 2015 Criminal Law Conference, the Prosecution Week and the \"Meet the Community\" programme.",
            "This latest review also contains feature articles on interviews with two ex-members of the Prosecutions Division - Mr Wesley Wong, SC, who was promoted to the post of Solicitor General on September 3, 2015, to head the Legal Policy Division, and Dr Alain Sham, who retired in early 2016 as Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions. Both of them shared their invaluable work experience, beliefs and views.",

            "刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師在年報的序言中闡述了刑事檢控科在二○一五年所面對的主要挑戰。他說，除了繁重的工作外，刑事檢控科年內面對更艱巨而根本的挑戰，是要處理日益增多的具爭議性案件，以及一些市民在法院程序進行期間破口大罵的行為。在這方面，楊家雄強調刑事檢控科既在處理所有案件時一貫保持政治中立，亦尊重不同的意見。楊家雄補充說：「在這情況下，我們意識到，更為重要的是檢控人員必須能夠立場堅定，繼續忠誠地履行作為『秉行公義者』的角色，並以此昂首自豪。」",
            "在向律政司司長提交該年報的信件中，楊家雄總結了刑事檢控科檢控人員在此期間的工作表現：「我們的檢控團隊……能專業地履行職務，公正、獨立、並不偏不倚地為秉行公義而克盡己職。檢控人員在面對艱巨挑戰時，各自緊守作為公義守護者的崗位，忠誠地依法協助法院找出事實真相以彰顯公義。」",
            "本年報亦提及刑事檢控科全部四名副刑事檢控專員分別在二○一五年（譚耀豪、梁卓然和許紹鼎）及二○一六年（黎婉姬）獲委任為資深大律師。就此，楊家雄說：「看到本科的資深檢控人員的工作獲得司法機構和廣大法律專業界認同，我深表欣慰……這不單反映他們的個人成就，也證明近年刑事檢控科人才濟濟，他們具備的專業知識既深且廣。」",
            "除詳述刑事檢控科不同分科及小組的主要活動和所處理的重要案件外，這份最新的年報也羅列檢控人員年內在本地及海外參加的各項培訓及會議的資訊。此外，刑事檢控科亦通過舉辦各種活動，如二○一五年刑事法律研討會、檢控週和「與公眾會面」計劃等，繼續積極與其合作夥伴及社會大眾保持聯繫。",
            "這份最新的年報亦載有訪問刑事檢控科兩名前成員的專題特稿，包括在二○一五年九月三日榮升法律政策專員，掌管法律政策科的黃惠沖資深大律師，及在二○一六年初榮休的副刑事檢控專員沈仲平博士。兩位都分享了他們的寶貴工作經驗、信念及意見。",
