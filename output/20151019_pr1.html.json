            "The following is issued on behalf of the Law Reform Commission:",
            "The Third Party Funding for Arbitration Sub-committee of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) released a consultation paper today (October 19) proposing that third party funding for arbitration taking place in Hong Kong should be permitted under Hong Kong law.",
            "The Sub-committee members are unanimously of the view that the current law in Hong Kong needs to be reformed to expressly permit third party funding for arbitration, subject to compliance by third party funders with appropriate ethical and financial standards.",
            "The Sub-committee considers that the reform can bring clear benefits to those interested in arbitration in Hong Kong and enhance Hong Kong's competitive position as an international arbitration centre, after conducting a review of the relevant law and practice in Hong Kong and in a number of other jurisdictions where arbitration is commonly used to resolve disputes.",
            "The legal doctrines of maintenance and champerty have been held by the Hong Kong Courts to continue to apply in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and to prohibit third party funding of litigation both as a tort and as a criminal offence, save in three exceptional areas: (1) where a third party has a legitimate interest in the outcome of the litigation; (2) where a party should be permitted to obtain third party funding, so as to enable him/her to have access to justice; and (3) in a miscellaneous category of proceedings including insolvency proceedings where third party funding is regularly allowed by the Hong Kong Courts.",
            "However, under the current law of the HKSAR, it is unclear whether the operation of the doctrines of maintenance and champerty in Hong Kong also applies to third party funding for arbitrations taking place in the HKSAR. Indeed, this question was expressly left open by the Court of Final Appeal in 2007 in the case of Unruh v Seeberger (2007) 10 HKCFAR 31.",
            "The Chairman of the Third Party Funding for Arbitration Sub-committee, Ms Kim M Rooney, noted that the HKSAR is a major international financial and arbitration centre and that parties considering whether to resolve their disputes in the HKSAR by international arbitration are starting to take into account, among others, the potential financing options available to them in conducting such arbitrations. Accordingly, clarity and certainty of the relevant law concerning third party funding for arbitration will be desirable.",
            "One of the Sub-committee's key proposals is that the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) should be amended to expressly provide that third party funding for arbitration taking place in the HKSAR is permitted under Hong Kong law. The Sub-committee also considers that the potential risks arising from third party funding can be minimised by implementing clear ethical and financial standards, and the consultation paper recommends the development of these standards.",
            "The Sub-committee left open the question as to whether the ethical and financial measures to regulate third party funding for arbitrations taking place in Hong Kong should be effected by statute or by self-regulation such as by third party funders agreeing to comply with a code of conduct. It considers that the HKSAR should develop its own model of regulation to suit its culture and needs, which will be informed by the experience and approach of other relevant jurisdictions.",
            "The Sub-committee therefore invites submissions among other issues as to:",
            "(1) Whether the development and supervision of the applicable ethical and financial standards should be conducted by: (a) a statutory or governmental body, whether existing or to be established, and if so, what type of body; or (b) a self-regulatory body, whether for a trial period or permanently, and how any ethical and financial standards should be enforced;",
            "(2) How the applicable ethical or financial standards should address relevant ethical and financial matters such as capital adequacy, conflicts of interest, confidentiality and privilege, control of the arbitration by the third party funder, grounds for termination of the third party funding, and complaints and enforcement procedures under the third party funding agreement; and",
            "(3) Whether there should be mandatory disclosure of third party funding to the Tribunal and to the other party/parties to the arbitration.",
            "The Sub-committee also recommends that consideration be given as to whether or not a tribunal should be granted the power to make an adverse costs order against a third party funder in arbitrations taking place in Hong Kong. It invites submissions on specific aspects of adverse costs orders, such as, whether or not a third party funder should be directly liable for adverse costs orders in a matter it has funded, whether there is a need to amend the Arbitration Ordinance to provide for the Tribunal's power to order third party funders to provide security for costs and the legal and jurisdictional basis for any such amendments (taking into account existing arbitral theory as to the limitation of a tribunal's jurisdiction in relation to third parties).",
            "Ms Rooney said that the Sub-committee would welcome views, comments and suggestions on any of the issues discussed in the consultation paper on or before January 18, 2016.",
            "All the views should be addressed as follows: by mail to The Secretary, Third Party Funding for Arbitration Sub-committee, LRC (4/F Justice Place, East Wing, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central, Hong Kong), by fax (3918 4096) or by e-mail (",
            "The consultation paper can be accessed on the website of the LRC at",
            ". Copies of the consultation paper are also available on request from the Secretariat of the LRC at the above address.",

            "法律改革委員會（法改會）轄下的第三方資助仲裁小組委員會今日（十月十九日）發表諮詢文件，建議香港法律應准許第三方資助在香港進行的仲裁。",
            "小組委員會成員一致認為，香港的現行法律需要改革，以明確說明在符合適當的專業操守及財務標準下，准許第三方資助仲裁。",
            "小組委員會經檢討香港和其他均有採用仲裁解決爭議的司法管轄區的相關法律及慣例後，認為有關改革對香港的仲裁持份者有明顯好處，亦可提升香港作為國際仲裁中心的競爭地位。",
            "香港法院裁定助訟及包攬訴訟法律原則繼續適用於香港特別行政區（香港特區），第三方資助訴訟兼屬侵權行為及刑事罪行須予禁止，但有三種情況例外：（一）第三方對訴訟結果有合法權益；（二）當事人應獲准取得第三方資助，使其可獲尋求公義的渠道；及（三）所涉及的是雜項類別法律程序（包括香港法院通常准許第三方資助的無力償債法律程序）。",
            "然而，根據香港特區的現行法律，助訟及包攬訴訟法律原則是否亦適用於在香港特區進行的第三方資助仲裁，情況並不清晰。事實上，終審法院於二○○七年在Unruh v Seeberger （2007）10 HKCFAR 31案中已表明對這個問題不下定論。",
            "第三方資助仲裁小組委員會主席甘婉玲表示，香港特區是主要國際金融中心及仲裁中心，當事人衡量是否在香港特區以國際仲裁方式解決爭議時，現時的考慮因素之一是有何融資選擇可供他們進行有關的仲裁。因此，就第三方資助仲裁訂定清晰明確的法律是可取的做法。",
            "小組委員會的主要建議之一，是《仲裁條例》（第609章）應作修訂，明文規定香港法律准許第三方資助在香港特區進行的仲裁。小組委員會認為第三方資助的潛在風險，可藉實施清晰的專業操守及財務標準而減至最低，並在諮詢文件中建議訂定這些標準。",
            "就規管第三方資助在香港進行的仲裁的專業操守及財務措施，應透過法規還是自我規管（例如由第三方出資者同意遵守行為守則）方式實施，小組委員會未下定論。小組委員會認為香港特區應參考其他相關司法管轄區的經驗和做法，訂定自己的規管模式，以配合本地文化及需要。",
            "因此，小組委員會邀請公眾就包括以下議題提交意見書：",
            "（一）適用的專業操守及財務標準的訂定和監管，應該（甲）由現有或日後成立的法定機構或政府機構進行（如屬此情況，則應為哪類機構）；或（乙）由自我規管機構進行，不論是試行一段期間或是永久實施，以及應如何執行專業操守及財務標準；",
            "（二）適用的專業操守或財務標準應如何處理相關專業操守及財務事宜，例如資本充足要求、利益衝突、保密性及法律專業保密特權、第三方出資者對仲裁的控制權、終止第三方資助的理據，以及第三方資助協議下的投訴及執行程序；及",
            "（三）就第三方資助向仲裁庭及仲裁另一方／其他各方作出的披露是否應為強制性。",
            "小組委員會亦建議考慮應否賦權仲裁庭在香港進行的仲裁中針對第三方出資者作出不利費用令。小組委員會邀請公眾就不利費用令的具體事宜提交意見書，例如第三方出資者應否就其資助的個案直接為不利費用令負上法律責任；是否需要修訂《仲裁條例》，就仲裁庭命令第三方出資者提供費用保證的權力作出規定；以及任何相關修訂的法律及司法管轄依據（當中考慮到現時有關限制仲裁庭對第三方的管轄權的仲裁理論）。",
            "甘婉玲表示，小組委員會歡迎各界於二○一六年一月十八日或之前就諮詢文件中討論的任何議題提出看法、意見及建議。",
            "意見應以郵遞（香港中環下亞厘畢道18號律政中心東座4樓）、傳真（3918 4096）或電郵（",
