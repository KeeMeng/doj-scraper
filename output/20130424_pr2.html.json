            "Following is a question by the Hon Albert Ho and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council today (April 24):",
            "Question:",
            "The Mediation Ordinance (Cap. 620) was passed by the Legislative Council on June 15, 2012 and, with the support of and promotion by the Department of Justice, the Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association Limited (HKMAAL) was incorporated as a non-profit-making company limited by guarantee in August of the same year. HKMAAL will discharge mediation-related accreditation and disciplinary functions. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(a) of the respective requirements on the professional qualifications for accredited mediators and instructors of mediator training courses;",
            "(b) whether the authorities will propose to HKMAAL to provide mediator training courses directly; if they will, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;",
            "(c) of the authorities' policy on promoting more use of mediation by the public in resolving disputes;",
            "(d) given that three of the member organisations of the Council of HKMAAL are legal professional bodies, whether the authorities have assessed if the professional development of mediation services will be dominated by the legal profession; if they have, of the assessment outcome; how the authorities ensure that mediators will come from different professions; and",
            "(e) given that at present, some mediation accrediting organisations assess student mediators by means of role-plays, in which student mediators take turns to play the roles of the mediator and the parties in dispute, resulting in the grading of a student being possibly affected by the performance of other students; whether the authorities know when HKMAAL will establish a standardised accreditation system to enhance public confidence in mediation services?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "My reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:",
            "(a) The Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association Limited (HKMAAL), a non-statutory industry-led accreditation body for mediators incorporated in August 2012 as a company limited by guarantee, is formulating accreditation standards and training requirements for mediators. For these purposes, HKMAAL has set up a Mediation Accreditation Committee and a Working Group on Accreditation Standards. HKMAAL will arrange briefings and discussion sessions and will release details of the accreditation criteria and training requirements in due course. The Administration will continue to monitor the development of accreditation and training of mediators through the Steering Committee on Mediation (Steering Committee) chaired by the Secretary for Justice (SJ) and its Accreditation Sub-committee.",
            "(b) HKMAAL is essentially a regulatory body. Its main function is to establish an accreditation system for mediators in Hong Kong with a view to maintaining and unifying the standards of mediators and ensuring the professionalism of mediators in Hong Kong.",
            "According to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of HKMAAL, its objectives include (i) setting standards for accredited mediators, supervisors, assessors, trainers, coaches and other professionals involved in mediation in Hong Kong and accrediting them on satisfying the requisite standards; and (ii) setting standards for relevant mediation training courses in Hong Kong, and approving them on satisfying the requisite standards.",
            "The Administration considers it more appropriate for HKMAAL to focus on setting standards for accredited mediators and other personnel involved in mediation and approving mediation training courses rather than providing mediation training courses. Organisations and bodies other than HKMAAL may continue to provide mediation training courses. In other words, the policy intent is to separate accreditation from training so as to avoid any possible conflict of interests.",
            "(c) The Steering Committee chaired by SJ will take the lead in promoting mediation as a cost-effective means to resolve disputes. The Public Education and Publicity Sub-committee (the Sub-committee), one of the three sub-committees of the Steering Committee, is tasked to propose and implement, in collaboration with the Judiciary, other government departments, organisations, stakeholders and the community, on-going and new initiatives for promoting and enhancing mediation as a means to resolve disputes.",
            "The Sub-committee has since met and is now considering various proposals for promoting the use of mediation in different sectors.",
            "(d) The four Founder Members of the HKMAAL comprise two legal professional bodies, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) and the Hong Kong Mediation Centre. The latter two are not legal professional bodies and have the largest panels of mediators from a diverse background including commercial, construction, accountancy, finance, medical and social work sectors. Notably, HKIAC also has a panel of Family Mediators which consists mainly of social workers. It is anticipated that other non-legal professional bodies will be admitted as members of HKMAAL, and HKMAAL's panel of mediators will also come from a diverse background.",
            "(e) As mentioned in (a) above, HKMAAL together with its Mediation Accreditation Committee and Working Group on Accreditation Standards is currently working on HKMAAL's accreditation standards and the requisite assessment arrangements. HKMAAL is aware of the concern arising from the arrangement by which candidates subject to accreditation assessments will participate in role plays for the accreditation assessments of other candidates. The effectiveness of this arrangement will be reviewed.",

            "以下是今日（四月二十四日）在立法會會議上何俊仁議員的提問和律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "立法會於二○一二年六月十五日制定《調解條例》（第620章），而香港調解資歷評審協會有限公司（調評會）在律政司的支持及推動下，於同年八月以非牟利擔保有限公司的形式成立。調評會將會履行調解資格評審和紀律審裁的職能。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）認可調解員及調解員課程導師的專業資歷要求分別為何；",
            "（二）當局會否建議調評會直接提供調解員培訓課程；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；",
            "（三）當局有何政策推動市民更多以調解方式解決紛爭；",
            "（四）鑑於調評會理事會的成員機構當中，有三個為法律專業團體，當局有否評估調解服務的專業發展會否被法律專業所主導；若有評估，結果為何；當局如何確保調解員來自不同專業；及",
            "（五）鑑於現時有調解資格評審機構採用學員輪流扮演調解員及爭議各方的方式評審學員，以至學員的成績可能受其他學員的表現所影響，當局是否知悉調評會將於何時設立一個統一的評審制度，以加強公眾對調解服務的信心？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "就問題各個部分，本人回覆如下：",
            "（一）香港調解資歷評審協會有限公司（調評會）是由業界主導的非法定調解員資歷認可組織，在二○一二年八月以擔保有限公司的形式成立。調評會目前正為調解員制訂資歷認可標準和培訓規定，並已為此成立調解評審委員會和資歷認可標準工作小組。調評會將安排簡報及討論，並會在適當時候公布資歷認可準則及培訓規定的細節。當局會透過由律政司司長擔任主席的調解督導委員會（督導委員會）及其轄下的評審資格小組委員會，繼續監察調解員資歷評審及培訓的發展。",
            "（二）調評會本質上是一個監管組織，主要職能在於為香港的調解員建立資歷認可制度，以維持和劃一調解員的水準，並提升他們的專業水平。",
            "根據調評會的組織章程大綱及章程細則，調評會的目標包括（ｉ）制定標準給認可調解員、監督員、評核員、訓練員、指導員及其他在香港參與調解的專業人員，並認可已符合標準的人士；以及（ｉｉ）制定香港的調解訓練課程標準，並認可已達標準的訓練課程。",
            "當局認為，調評會較宜專注為認可調解員及其他參與調解的人員制定標準和認可調解訓練課程，而非提供調解訓練課程。調評會以外的組織及團體可繼續提供調解訓練課程。換言之，政策原意是將制定認可標準與提供訓練兩項工作分開，以避免任何利益衝突。",
            "（三）由律政司司長擔任主席的督導委員會，將會領導提倡調解服務，作為有效益的解決爭議方法。督導委員會轄下設有三個小組委員會，公眾教育及宣傳小組委員會（小組委員會）是其中之一，負責建議，並聯同司法機構、其他政府部門、組織、持份者及社會人士實施持續推行和新開展的計劃，從而促進採用調解作為解決爭議的方法。",
            "小組委員會已舉行會議，目前正研究多項建議，以期在不同界別提倡使用調解。",
            "（四）調評會的四名創辦成員包括兩個法律專業團體、香港國際仲裁中心及香港和解中心。後兩者並非法律專業團體，而且擁有最多調解員，他們來自各行各業，包括商界、建築界、會計界、金融界、醫療界及社會服務界。香港國際仲裁中心還有一批主要是社會工作者的家事調解員。其他法律專業以外的專業團體亦預期會加入成為調評會的成員，而調評會的調解員亦將會來自各行各業。",
            "（五）正如上文第（一）項所述，調評會正聯同轄下的調解評審委員會和資歷認可標準工作小組，着手制訂調評會的資歷認可標準及所需的評審安排。根據現行安排，接受資歷評核的考生，會在其他考生的資歷評核中參與角色扮演。調評會知悉這安排所引起的關注，並會檢討當中的成效。",
