            "A spokesman for the Department of Justice said today (January 25) that no further action is warranted regarding the film footage posted on a website in October 2012 involving the Secretary for Development, Mr Paul Chan.",
            "The spokesman said that the film footage appeared to have been edited, but the Police could not obtain any further evidence or other assistance from the person(s) taking the film footage or any other relevant persons. Given the limited evidence available, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Mr Kevin Zervos, SC, after carefully considering the matter according to established legal principles and The Statement of Prosecution Policy and Practice, concluded that no further action is warranted.",
            "In October 2012, film footage was posted on a website depicting in one instance Mr Chan drinking beer while using the restaurant facilities with his family at the Hong Kong Jockey Club, and in another instance Mr Chan's private motor vehicle being driven on a road which momentarily crossed continuous double white lines. Mr Chan took the initiative to report the matter to the Police. After completing investigation, the Police sought legal advice from the Department of Justice.",
            "The Secretary for Justice, in order to avoid any possible perception of bias or improper influence, after satisfying himself that the DPP had no connection with any person involved in the case, delegated to DPP the authority to handle the case, including considering whether any prosecution action is warranted.",

            "律政司發言人今日（一月二十五日）表示，有關在二○一二年十月上載於一個網頁涉及發展局局長陳茂波的錄像片段，律政司決定不需採取進一步行動。",
            "發言人表示有關錄像片段似乎曾被剪輯，但警方卻未能獲得拍攝該錄像片段的人士或其他相關人士提供進一步證據或其他協助。由於證據有限，刑事檢控專員薛偉成資深大律師按照既定的法律原則及檢控政策及常規，經仔細考慮事件後，決定不需採取進一步行動。",
            "在二○一二年十月上載於一個網頁的錄像片段顯示陳茂波與其家人於香港賽馬會使用餐飲設施期間曾經飲用啤酒，而在另一個場合，陳茂波的私家車被拍攝到於路上行駛時短暫地越過雙白線。其後陳茂波主動聯絡警方，警方完成調查後向律政司尋求法律意見。",
            "為免可能產生偏頗和不當影響的印象，律政司司長在信納刑事檢控專員與涉及此案的任何人士沒有關連後，已授權刑事檢控專員處理該案，包括考慮是否應作出檢控。",
