            "A spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) said today (December 19) that pursuant to the policy objective of enhancing Hong Kong's status as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, the Government will provide certain space to LROs in the West Wing of the former CGO and the entire former FMB, upon the relocation of the Court of Final Appeal from there. Together with the DoJ offices to be housed in the Main Wing, East Wing and part of West Wing of the former CGO, the area will become a legal hub at the heart of Hong Kong.",
            "The provision of space to LROs in the legal hub will enable existing ones to develop their services and create a favourable environment to attract more international legal and dispute resolution institutions to set up offices in Hong Kong, which will further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region.",

The Committee will consider the applications and advise on the selection of LROs based on assessment of the relative merits of prospective organisations.",
