            "The Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC; the Secretary for Transport and Housing, Mr Frank Chan Fan; and the Secretary for Security, Mr John Lee, held a press conference on the co-location arrangement of the Hong Kong Section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link this afternoon (July 25). Following is the transcript of remarks at the press conference:",
            "Secretary for Justice: Before responding to your questions, I would like to make a few concluding remarks.",
            "First, I note that there are comments to the effect that implementing co-location would amount to a cession of our land in favour of the Mainland. I would like to clarify, there is no question of any cession or giving up of land. The reasons are obvious. According to Article 7 of the Basic Law, the land and natural resources within the HKSAR shall be State property. The HKSARG shall be responsible for their management, use and development and for their lease or grant to individuals, legal persons or organisations for use or development. The revenues derived therefrom shall be exclusively at the disposal of the HKSARG. As pointed out earlier, the Mainland Port Area will be leased to the relevant Mainland authorities, and there will not be any transfer of property ownership.",
            "Second, there are views suggesting that the implementation of co-location would prejudice Hong Kong people’s rights. I hope the community can look at this question rationally and objectively. Since XRL is a cross-border railway, it will necessarily involve CIQ procedures. The main choices are the traditional separate-location arrangement or the proposed co-location arrangement. If one is to compare co-location with separate-location arrangement, it will be crystal clear that the proposed co-location arrangement will not change the CIQ procedures or the applicable law; besides, the rights and obligations of the passengers when going through the CIQ procedures will also remain the same.",
            "Third, some people have queried whether the implementation of co-location arrangement would set a bad precedent, and that there would be more and more places within the HKSAR where the Mainland laws would be applied, and thereby contravening the “one country, two systems” policy.",
            "One would not have such a query if one reminds ourselves the background leading to the idea of implementing co-location arrangement. It is the HKSARG who decided to construct the XRL. It is also the HKSARG who proposed to study the implementation of co-location arrangement. The implementation of co-location arrangement is neither a directive nor an order by the Central People’s Government (CPG). Besides, the implementation of co-location would require the consent of both the HKSARG and the CPG before it can be done.",
            "The only reason why the HKSARG requests the assistance of CPG for implementing co-location arrangement is to maximise the potentials of the Hong Kong Section of the XRL. There is no intention, let alone reason, to act in contravention of the \"one country, two systems” policy. On the contrary, as I have pointed out repeatedly, one of the objectives insisted by both the HKSARG and the CPG through our discussion on co-location is to ensure that the arrangement would be consistent with the “one country, two systems” policy and would not be in contravention of the Basic Law.",
            "Fourth, the implementation of co-location arrangement for the Hong Kong Section of XRL is a transport issue, and that it concerns the overall future development of Hong Kong and its competitiveness. The legal issues involved can be dealt with through legal means. I hope that people would not over-politicise such transport or legal issues. Over-politicisation would not be conducive to the healthy development of our community or the overall interest of the HKSAR.",
            "Thank you very much! I and my colleagues will be more than happy to answer your questions.",
            "Reporter: Some people fear they would get into troubles in the Mainland port area (MPA) should they, like, say wear a T-shirt commemorating the Tiananmen Square crackdown or, like, calling for the end of one-party rule, even though they are on Hong Kong soil. So how will you address these legitimate concerns? And I understand you believe the arrangement would not violate Article 18 of the Basic Law. But are you confident that it would not be challenged in court or defeated in court? And my second question is would there be any Mainland armed officers in the MPA. If yes, how many of them and would there be any regulations to make sure they would only be able to open fire under very limited conditions? Thank you.",
            "Secretary for Justice: Well, thank you for your question. I think maybe I would endeavour to answer your first two questions and would leave the third question to the Secretary for Security. In answer to your first question, I think the point is exactly the point that I made earlier when I did the concluding remarks and that is, imagine you are now having an express railway but with no co-location. What would happen to a passenger? The passenger would still go through two CIQ checkpoints, and once you are within the Mainland port area, you would be having the same treatment irrespective of what you are going to do, whether you are going to do it at this point of time because of co-location or because there was separate location arrangement. So my answer to your first point is there is no change, because co-location would not by itself change the rights or obligations, nor would it change the CIQ procedure or the applicable law.",
            "In relation to your second question, we have already explained in my introduction earlier why we do not think Article 18 of the Basic Law will apply, and that is because of what we can generally in legal terms call as the deeming provision, namely that the Mainland port area would be regarded as outside the territorial boundary of Hong Kong, and that is the part which I draw reference to section 5, subsection 2 of Cap 591, which is the Shenzhen port ordinance (Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Port Area Ordinance).",
            "In relation to legal proceedings, of course we, the Government, cannot control people as to whether they would like to commence legal proceedings. On the contrary, we respect people's rights under the Basic Law to institute whatever legal proceedings that they think they are entitled to, and it is for the court to decide whether or not the legal proceedings so commenced are justified or otherwise. And therefore, in so far as we are concerned, we would deal with such legal proceedings as they arise, but having looked into the matter and having considered the matter in quite some depth, we are quite confident that we can withstand legal challenges if we can get through all the three stages. Thank you. Maybe I will leave the third question, as I said, to Secretary for Security, Mr Lee.",
            "Secretary for Security: As regards the question about who will be working in the mainland port and how they will be equipped, in our discussion, I have been told that they will be running this mainland port in the same way as they run a mainland port in the mainland area. They will copy the model that they will be using in running a normal port, copy that model to use it in Hong Kong.",
            "They indicate that they will do no more, that’s the first thing, they will do no more than a normal mainland port as if it is in the mainland area. I believe that the officers who eventually work in the mainland port area will come from Guangdong or Shenzhen mainly. So I will talk about the model as I understand they will use in running a port in Guangdong.",
            "They will be, as I explained, stationing officers from five areas. First of all, they are immigration staff, so you can understand how they will work because we have a similar immigration department in Hong Kong. Then they will station customs officers and we have a customs service in Hong Kong, so you can understand how they work. Then they have the safety in regard to health and quarantine, and I think you generally understand how they will work.",
            "The fourth area is something that we don’t have in Hong Kong, which is the administration of port. This unit generally has no power of enforcement, so they have no legal power to take any enforcement measures against travellers or passengers. They mainly do administration in regard to the port and also coordinate different officers that work there.",
            "The fifth area is the police post that they may be setting up as they would set up in a normal port in Guangdong. The model as I understand in Guangdong is this police post will basically receive reports from people who need help. They will be dealing with emergencies, they will assist to request for help, and also, they may do patrol. When they do patrol on a day-to-day basis, they will be carrying their batons. The model as I understand in Guangdong is that when an officer goes on patrol, that’s the equipment they carry. Regarding other equipment, they will draw as circumstances require. So say when there is an intelligence about terrorist attack, of course they will have to do some precautions. Then the equipment will be drawn as necessary to deal with that particular incident. But on a day-to-day basis, when they do patrol, in the Guangdong model, generally they will equip with a baton.",
            "On other question you asked how many officers will be working there, they are working out. I believe the format they use will be the same format they adopt as if this port is just one of the normal port areas.",
            "Reporter: Mr Yuen, for the arrangement, you are effectively having parts of Hong Kong, even though it's in the basement and the train compartments, you are effectively making them not Hong Kong soil. You are making them Mainland area. Are you actually creating an arrangement that overrides the Basic Law, that does not have the Basic Law implemented there? Secondly, a very practical question: When a passenger is waiting for a train on the platform, can they access websites such as Facebook, etc? Thank you?",
            "Secretary for Justice: The second question first. The short answer is I do not know the answer to your question, but one thing I can tell you is when you are a northbound passenger and you are waiting for the train, you won't be standing on the platform, because there is a designated waiting area and you will be waiting there. I think it's a very good question. I think I would like to find out the answer later myself, so thank you for raising that.",
            "In relation to your first question, I think my answer is no. It's not really in the way that you put it. Again, if I may hark back on the reference point that I have made earlier, and that is Cap 591 of the Laws of Hong Kong, and I would urge you to look at the wordings of that particular section, and if I remember correctly it is to the effect that for the purpose of the applications of the Hong Kong law then the Hong Kong port area at the Shenzhen Bay would be regarded as within the territory of Hong Kong. So, in other words, the point that I will like to highlight is for a deeming provision of this nature it would specify the purpose of the deeming provision, and in section 5, subsection 2 of Cap 591 it specifies that the deeming provision is solely for the purpose of the application of Hong Kong law and therefore applying the same approach and by parity of reason, what we would be suggesting that we will be doing is that for the purpose of the application of Hong Kong law as well as the Mainland law and the division of the two as well as the division or demarcation of the respective jurisdictions, and it is for that specific purpose that the Mainland port area would be regarded as outside the territorial boundary of Hong Kong. So, in other words, it is (a) for a specific purpose, namely the purpose that I have identified, and (b) it is solely in the context of our co-location arrangement implementation. It is not for a general purpose. Therefore, I would beg to differ that it is in effect carving out a part of Hong Kong outside Hong Kong and I hope you would accept my explanation. Thank you.",
            "Reporter: Just now you said that the arrangement is solely to enable co-location. Can you promise that such an arrangement of putting a part of land regarded not as Hong Kong's territory will not be repeated in the future, because you said it is solely for the purpose of co-location? Second of all, in the document you've prepared, you said that the agreement could be amended, including perhaps changing or enlarging the area of the Mainland port area due to need or expansion of the station. Can you tell us a bit about how large can the area get? Do you have a limit on that?",
            "Secretary for Justice: As far as I understand, any suggestions as to the enlargement of the area, especially in relation to the area on B2 and B3, would be unlikely, if not impossible. The only possibility that we will be talking about is the detailed arrangement in relation to the platform, because that would depend on the number of trains that would be making use of the platform, and that would depend on the future traffic and therefore I don't think one should worry too much, if at all, about the expansion of the Mainland port area. Perhaps if I may emphasise again, as I was trying to make the point, perhaps it's my thought that I haven't made it clear, and that is in discussing the area of the Mainland port area I tried to give a narrative of what constitutes the area and then I also said look at it from a different angle. It involves effectively the path of a passenger who is arriving from the Mainland, and then plus the path of a passenger who is departing Hong Kong, and therefore in fact the whole idea or the rationale of devising and demarcating the area, which gave rise to or which we label as the Mainland port area, is for that particular purpose. And therefore that is a very operational rationale and therefore I don't see any reason, really, to enlarge the Mainland port area, and I guess perhaps the other side wouldn't want to pay an extra rent for that as well. So for that reason I guess the risk is unlikely.",
            "In response to your first question, I think of course I cannot say anything for the future terms of the Government. I think what I can say is for the time being, if you agree with me, as I explained earlier, that the whole point of asking the Central People's Government to agree to assist us in making this co-location arrangement happen is because we want to maximise the potential of the XRL. I don't anticipate that in the near future we would have yet another XRL, but if that is the case perhaps it would be good for Hong Kong and it would be the very intention or the things that our Secretary for Transport and Housing would have to consider. I can't answer that from the legal perspective. Thank you.",

            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師、運輸及房屋局局長陳帆和保安局局長李家超今日（七月二十五日）下午就廣深港高速鐵路（香港段）一地兩檢安排舉行記者會。以下是記者會的答問全文：",
            "律政司司長：各位傳媒朋友，在回應大家的問題之前，我希望歸納及強調幾點︰",
            "第一，我留意到社會上有所謂「割地」的言論。我希望澄清，今次的建議，絶對不存在任何所謂的「割地」的元素或效果。原因非常清晰。依據《基本法》第七條，香港特區境內的土地和自然資源屬於國家所有，由特區負責管理、使用、開發、出租或批給個人、法人或團體使用或開發，其收入全歸特區政府支配。正如剛才介紹指出，「內地口岸區」的場地及空間將以租賃方式交予內地相關單位使用，當中不會涉及任何業權的轉移。",
            "第二，社會上有言論指落實一地兩檢會削弱香港人的權益。我希望大家能夠理性、客觀地去分析這問題。高鐵是跨境的鐵路，因此必然會涉及通關的程序。主要的選擇是傳統兩地兩檢或現時建議的一地兩檢。比較兩者，一地兩檢不會改變兩地各自的通關程序或適用的法律，乘客在辦理通關手續時的權益亦不會有任何改變，換言之，無論我們兩地兩檢或一地兩檢，在權益上不會有改變。因此我們現在建議用一地兩檢的目的是便利乘客，而在涉及的程序、法律和權益不會有任何改變，所以不會存在削弱港人的權益。",
            "第三，社會上亦有部分人士質疑落實一地兩檢會否開壞先例，亦擔心日後會否相繼有香港特區境內其他地方會落實或實施內地法律，破壞「一國兩制」。若大家考慮落實一地兩檢的背景，則不會有以上所講的疑慮。高鐵（香港段）是特區政府決定興建，亦是特區政府建議研究落實一地兩檢。落實一地兩檢絶對，我強調，絶非中央的指令，亦需要特區與中央雙方同意才可落實一地兩檢。今次香港特區要求中央協助落實一地兩檢，唯一的原因是要發揮高鐵（香港段）的效益，當中並無任何意圖，更加沒有任何理由去破壞「一國兩制」。相反，正如我多次指出，在特區與中央商討一地兩檢的過程中，雙方一直堅持一地兩檢的方案必須符合「一國兩制」及必須不違反《基本法》。",
            "第四，歸根究底，高鐵一地兩檢是一個運輸交通問題，亦涉及香港未來整體發展和競爭力。當中的法律問題可依循法律途徑解決。我希望大家不要將運輸或法律問題過分政治化。過分政治化對社會發展及香港整體利益絶對無任何好處。",
            "多謝大家！我會用英文簡單重覆剛才的重點，然後和兩位局長樂意回答大家的問題。",
            "記者：司長，你好。想問問其實在你的文件中說過，就是把內地口岸區視作為香港特區範圍之外。究竟這個是否需要任何立法程序抑或是政府說一句便算？如果那個地方可以成為香港特區政府的範圍之外，為甚麼特區政府又可以有理據在六個指定範圍之內進入進行執法，執行香港法律？另外還有一件事就是立法會程序方面，究竟政府打算用甚麼形式交上立法會？如果最終不通過的話，政府有沒有後備方案？高鐵會否如期通車？謝謝。",
            "律政司司長：多謝你的提問。其實好像剛才我也有說過，就是把內地口岸區的範圍視作為香港區域範圍以外這個方式其實是借鏡當年，二○○七年時處理深圳灣的模式。剛才我在介紹時亦向大家說了。如果大家看香港法例第591章第5條第二款，正正亦是用了「視為」或英文regarded as的方式、這個字眼。",
            "而當然我們在處理今次一地兩檢這個事項時，不會單單在香港要進行立法的程序，亦是為甚麼我們會說香港這方面與內地首先用一個合作的安排，雙方有這樣的協議。雙方同意這個區域劃分為內地口岸區，而中間的法律和管轄權，好像剛才介紹去劃分，然後把這個劃分或簡單地說這個協議，即這個合作安排的協議，會呈交上全國人大常委（會）作批准及確認。有了這個批准和確認後，我們會在香港進行本地立法工作。因此，我們anticipate（預期）會在日後，若然我們取得全國人大常委（會）的決定後，到時會有一條類似，當然並不是一樣，是類似第591章的香港法例。剛才你問我們會怎樣去提出，這個將會與其他任何本地立法的工作用同一模式。最後，回答你的問題最後部分──我們沒有其他後備方案。我們希望可以如期在二○一八年第三季前完成所有剛才所說的三個步驟的工作。多謝。",
            "記者：司長，想問問是否開始討論《合作安排》，譬如你說在內地口岸區拿到那個「期」，即租的期限和費用，其實政府有否一個初步建議，那期限是多久？或費用其實是怎樣計算？另外都想問問香港人其實都很關心內地執法人員在香港執法，會否就這些內地人員在香港執法會否有另加的一些條款或條例，或可能限制他們要即日回到內地？",
            "律政司司長：或者看看稍後陳局長會否有補充。據我理解，我可以回答到你的問題，就是剛才我們所說的合作安排，其實我們已經談到一個很成熟的階段，亦因為這個原因，剛才我們可以和你介紹這個合作安排所涵蓋的範圍，包括雙方設立的口岸區和範圍、法律適用和管轄權的分配、出入境時乘客的監管，還有剛才所提及的協調機制、應急機制、修改和生效。這個其實便是現在雙方對這個合作安排內容的共識。",
            "至於費用，正如剛才所說，大家現在有個共識，便是內地口岸區的使用權是需要繳費，但繳費的問題和其他譬如維修及其他年期，大家亦同意另外會有一個合約去處理。所以費用的問題，現在是未有一個實質數字，這個日後仍然需要商討的。",
            "就剛才這位記者朋友關於執法方面的問題，執法方面，我們現在的理解就是內地工作人員每一天由內地到西九工作，然後在落班時會用鐵路返回內地，不會留在香港過夜。或陳局長有否其他補充？",
            "運輸及房屋局局長: 我想好像司長剛才回答，因為費用和相關細節的安排，我們仍然在討論當中，所以連同期限暫時都未有一個定論，待我們有決定的時候，若你有興趣，我們可以告訴你。",
            "記者：想問關於合同方面，現在你們有個時間表會是甚麼時候簽？以及租那個費用會否傾向一個象徵式，即收少少錢便算，還是像深圳灣的模式，即數百萬一年？這是第一個問題。同時，想問剛才李局長表示日常巡邏就會帶警棍，但其實會否配槍？是否只是在收到恐襲情報的情況下才會配槍？以及是否交給人大常委會做一個批示之前，都會上立法會去尋求通過一個決議案？",
            "律政司司長：或者我答最後一個部分，然後我交給陳局長答第一部分，第二部分由李局長回答。其實今日我們開這個記者會，並向社會介紹及公布我們現在工作的進展的目的，正正是向香港社會交代這件事，並向香港社會介紹現在這個建議的內容，以及希望大家提出意見。由現在到立法會復會，希望可以在社會上有討論，而立法會復會之後或甚至立法會復會之前，我們都會考慮以適當的形式在立法會裏進行一個討論。因為特首亦講過，我們非常尊重與立法會的關係，亦尊重立法會議員就這件事的意見，所以我們一定用一個合適的方法來跟立法會做一個溝通。這個絕對不會希望逃避立法會，甚至有人說是否趁立法會「放暑假」才公布（一地兩檢安排），絕對沒有這個意圖，我們一定會有一個途徑與立法會有個溝通，或者請陳局長回答（有關）費用的問題。",
            "運輸及房屋局局長：多謝這位朋友的提問，費用的徵收，剛才我已說過，在此留一些時間，暫時沒有補充。或者在佩槍方面，看看李局長有沒有回應。",
            "保安局局長：多謝這位記者的提問。我必須強調：第一，真真正正在內地口岸區因為內地的法律適用，所以在運作方面，我們必須尊重（內地）自主權，由內地的相關單位決定實際運作模式。但我亦都可以說，一般來說，我了解在廣東省內的口岸，他們的運作模式亦好像我剛才所說，就算要巡邏的時候，他們一般都會配備警棍。那麼他們在甚麼情況下需要添加裝備，是哪一類的裝備，一定要按實際情況由當地的機關去決定。至於在香港的運作模式，亦要按實際需要而去決定我們用哪一種巡邏模式，或哪些裝備，我們都要按實際情況。所以我剛才所說在一般的口岸，他們會這樣做，但在實際運作上需要作出怎樣的安排都是由有關單位按實際情況去決定。但一般來說，以我的理解他們的巡邏是會用警棍的。",

            "In relation to your second question, we have already explained in my introduction earlier why we do not think Article 18 of the Basic Law will apply, and that is because of what we can generally in legal terms call as the deeming provision, namely that the Mainland port area would be regarded as outside the territorial boundary of Hong Kong, and that is the part which I draw reference to section 5, subsection 2 of Cap 591, which is the Shenzhen port ordinance (Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Port Area Ordinance).",
            "In relation to legal proceedings, of course we, the Government, cannot control people as to whether they would like to commence legal proceedings",
            "On the contrary, we respect people's rights under the Basic Law to institute whatever legal proceedings that they think they are entitled to, and it is for the court to decide whether or not the legal proceedings so commenced are justified or otherwise",
            "And therefore, in so far as we are concerned, we would deal with such legal proceedings as they arise, but having looked into the matter and having considered the matter in quite some depth, we are quite confident that we can withstand legal challenges if we can get through all the three stages",
            "Thank you",
            "Maybe I will leave the third question, as I said, to Secretary for Security, Mr Lee.",
            "Secretary for Security: As regards the question about who will be working in the mainland port and how they will be equipped, in our discussion, I have been told that they will be running this mainland port in the same way as they run a mainland port in the mainland area",
            "They will copy the model that they will be using in running a normal port, copy that model to use it in Hong Kong.",
            "They indicate that they will do no more, that’s the first thing, they will do no more than a normal mainland port as if it is in the mainland area",
            "I believe that the officers who eventually work in the mainland port area will come from Guangdong or Shenzhen mainly",
            "So I will talk about the model as I understand they will use in running a port in Guangdong.",
            "They will be, as I explained, stationing officers from five areas",
            "First of all, they are immigration staff, so you can understand how they will work because we have a similar immigration department in Hong Kong",
            "Then they will station customs officers and we have a customs service in Hong Kong, so you can understand how they work",
            "Then they have the safety in regard to health and quarantine, and I think you generally understand how they will work.",
            "The fourth area is something that we don’t have in Hong Kong, which is the administration of port",
            "This unit generally has no power of enforcement, so they have no legal power to take any enforcement measures against travellers or passengers",
            "They mainly do administration in regard to the port and also coordinate different officers that work there.",
            "The fifth area is the police post that they may be setting up as they would set up in a normal port in Guangdong",
            "The model as I understand in Guangdong is this police post will basically receive reports from people who need help",
            "They will be dealing with emergencies, they will assist to request for help, and also, they may do patrol",
            "When they do patrol on a day-to-day basis, they will be carrying their batons",
            "The model as I understand in Guangdong is that when an officer goes on patrol, that’s the equipment they carry",
            "Regarding other equipment, they will draw as circumstances require",
            "So say when there is an intelligence about terrorist attack, of course they will have to do some precautions",
            "Then the equipment will be drawn as necessary to deal with that particular incident",
            "But on a day-to-day basis, when they do patrol, in the Guangdong model, generally they will equip with a baton.",
            "On other question you asked how many officers will be working there, they are working out",
            "I believe the format they use will be the same format they adopt as if this port is just one of the normal port areas.",
            "Reporter: Mr Yuen, for the arrangement, you are effectively having parts of Hong Kong, even though it's in the basement and the train compartments, you are effectively making them not Hong Kong soil",
            "You are making them Mainland area",
            "Are you actually creating an arrangement that overrides the Basic Law, that does not have the Basic Law implemented there? Secondly, a very practical question: When a passenger is waiting for a train on the platform, can they access websites such as Facebook, etc? Thank you?",
            "Secretary for Justice: The second question first",
            "The short answer is I do not know the answer to your question, but one thing I can tell you is when you are a northbound passenger and you are waiting for the train, you won't be standing on the platform, because there is a designated waiting area and you will be waiting there",
            "I think it's a very good question",
            "I think I would like to find out the answer later myself, so thank you for raising that.",
            "In relation to your first question, I think my answer is no",
            "It's not really in the way that you put it",
            "Again, if I may hark back on the reference point that I have made earlier, and that is Cap 591 of the Laws of Hong Kong, and I would urge you to look at the wordings of that particular section, and if I remember correctly it is to the effect that for the purpose of the applications of the Hong Kong law then the Hong Kong port area at the Shenzhen Bay would be regarded as within the territory of Hong Kong",
            "So, in other words, the point that I will like to highlight is for a deeming provision of this nature it would specify the purpose of the deeming provision, and in section 5, subsection 2 of Cap 591 it specifies that the deeming provision is solely for the purpose of the application of Hong Kong law and therefore applying the same approach and by parity of reason, what we would be suggesting that we will be doing is that for the purpose of the application of Hong Kong law as well as the Mainland law and the division of the two as well as the division or demarcation of the respective jurisdictions, and it is for that specific purpose that the Mainland port area would be regarded as outside the territorial boundary of Hong Kong",
            "So, in other words, it is (a) for a specific purpose, namely the purpose that I have identified, and (b) it is solely in the context of our co-location arrangement implementation",
            "It is not for a general purpose",
            "Therefore, I would beg to differ that it is in effect carving out a part of Hong Kong outside Hong Kong and I hope you would accept my explanation",
            "Thank you.",
            "Reporter: Just now you said that the arrangement is solely to enable co-location",
            "Can you promise that such an arrangement of putting a part of land regarded not as Hong Kong's territory will not be repeated in the future, because you said it is solely for the purpose of co-location? Second of all, in the document you've prepared, you said that the agreement could be amended, including perhaps changing or enlarging the area of the Mainland port area due to need or expansion of the station",
            "Can you tell us a bit about how large can the area get? Do you have a limit on that?",
            "Secretary for Justice: As far as I understand, any suggestions as to the enlargement of the area, especially in relation to the area on B2 and B3, would be unlikely, if not impossible",
            "The only possibility that we will be talking about is the detailed arrangement in relation to the platform, because that would depend on the number of trains that would be making use of the platform, and that would depend on the future traffic and therefore I don't think one should worry too much, if at all, about the expansion of the Mainland port area",
            "Perhaps if I may emphasise again, as I was trying to make the point, perhaps it's my thought that I haven't made it clear, and that is in discussing the area of the Mainland port area I tried to give a narrative of what constitutes the area and then I also said look at it from a different angle",
            "It involves effectively the path of a passenger who is arriving from the Mainland, and then plus the path of a passenger who is departing Hong Kong, and therefore in fact the whole idea or the rationale of devising and demarcating the area, which gave rise to or which we label as the Mainland port area, is for that particular purpose",
            "And therefore that is a very operational rationale and therefore I don't see any reason, really, to enlarge the Mainland port area, and I guess perhaps the other side wouldn't want to pay an extra rent for that as well",
            "So for that reason I guess the risk is unlikely.",
            "In response to your first question, I think of course I cannot say anything for the future terms of the Government",
            "I think what I can say is for the time being, if you agree with me, as I explained earlier, that the whole point of asking the Central People's Government to agree to assist us in making this co-location arrangement happen is because we want to maximise the potential of the XRL",
            "I don't anticipate that in the near future we would have yet another XRL, but if that is the case perhaps it would be good for Hong Kong and it would be the very intention or the things that our Secretary for Transport and Housing would have to consider",
            "I can't answer that from the legal perspective",
            "Thank you.",

            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師、運輸及房屋局局長陳帆和保安局局長李家超今日（七月二十五日）下午就廣深港高速鐵路（香港段）一地兩檢安排舉行記者會",
            "以下是記者會的答問全文：",
            "律政司司長：各位傳媒朋友，在回應大家的問題之前，我希望歸納及強調幾點︰",
            "第一，我留意到社會上有所謂「割地」的言論",
            "我希望澄清，今次的建議，絶對不存在任何所謂的「割地」的元素或效果",
            "原因非常清晰",
            "依據《基本法》第七條，香港特區境內的土地和自然資源屬於國家所有，由特區負責管理、使用、開發、出租或批給個人、法人或團體使用或開發，其收入全歸特區政府支配",
            "正如剛才介紹指出，「內地口岸區」的場地及空間將以租賃方式交予內地相關單位使用，當中不會涉及任何業權的轉移",
            "第二，社會上有言論指落實一地兩檢會削弱香港人的權益",
            "我希望大家能夠理性、客觀地去分析這問題",
            "高鐵是跨境的鐵路，因此必然會涉及通關的程序",
            "主要的選擇是傳統兩地兩檢或現時建議的一地兩檢",
            "比較兩者，一地兩檢不會改變兩地各自的通關程序或適用的法律，乘客在辦理通關手續時的權益亦不會有任何改變，換言之，無論我們兩地兩檢或一地兩檢，在權益上不會有改變",
            "因此我們現在建議用一地兩檢的目的是便利乘客，而在涉及的程序、法律和權益不會有任何改變，所以不會存在削弱港人的權益",
            "第三，社會上亦有部分人士質疑落實一地兩檢會否開壞先例，亦擔心日後會否相繼有香港特區境內其他地方會落實或實施內地法律，破壞「一國兩制」",
            "若大家考慮落實一地兩檢的背景，則不會有以上所講的疑慮",
            "高鐵（香港段）是特區政府決定興建，亦是特區政府建議研究落實一地兩檢",
            "落實一地兩檢絶對，我強調，絶非中央的指令，亦需要特區與中央雙方同意才可落實一地兩檢",
            "今次香港特區要求中央協助落實一地兩檢，唯一的原因是要發揮高鐵（香港段）的效益，當中並無任何意圖，更加沒有任何理由去破壞「一國兩制」",
            "相反，正如我多次指出，在特區與中央商討一地兩檢的過程中，雙方一直堅持一地兩檢的方案必須符合「一國兩制」及必須不違反《基本法》",
            "第四，歸根究底，高鐵一地兩檢是一個運輸交通問題，亦涉及香港未來整體發展和競爭力",
            "當中的法律問題可依循法律途徑解決",
            "我希望大家不要將運輸或法律問題過分政治化",
            "過分政治化對社會發展及香港整體利益絶對無任何好處",
            "多謝大家！我會用英文簡單重覆剛才的重點，然後和兩位局長樂意回答大家的問題",
            "記者：司長，你好",
            "想問問其實在你的文件中說過，就是把內地口岸區視作為香港特區範圍之外",
            "究竟這個是否需要任何立法程序抑或是政府說一句便算？如果那個地方可以成為香港特區政府的範圍之外，為甚麼特區政府又可以有理據在六個指定範圍之內進入進行執法，執行香港法律？另外還有一件事就是立法會程序方面，究竟政府打算用甚麼形式交上立法會？如果最終不通過的話，政府有沒有後備方案？高鐵會否如期通車？謝謝",
            "律政司司長：多謝你的提問",
            "其實好像剛才我也有說過，就是把內地口岸區的範圍視作為香港區域範圍以外這個方式其實是借鏡當年，二○○七年時處理深圳灣的模式",
            "剛才我在介紹時亦向大家說了",
            "如果大家看香港法例第591章第5條第二款，正正亦是用了「視為」或英文regarded as的方式、這個字眼",
            "而當然我們在處理今次一地兩檢這個事項時，不會單單在香港要進行立法的程序，亦是為甚麼我們會說香港這方面與內地首先用一個合作的安排，雙方有這樣的協議",
            "雙方同意這個區域劃分為內地口岸區，而中間的法律和管轄權，好像剛才介紹去劃分，然後把這個劃分或簡單地說這個協議，即這個合作安排的協議，會呈交上全國人大常委（會）作批准及確認",
            "有了這個批准和確認後，我們會在香港進行本地立法工作",
            "因此，我們anticipate（預期）會在日後，若然我們取得全國人大常委（會）的決定後，到時會有一條類似，當然並不是一樣，是類似第591章的香港法例",
            "剛才你問我們會怎樣去提出，這個將會與其他任何本地立法的工作用同一模式",
            "最後，回答你的問題最後部分──我們沒有其他後備方案",
            "我們希望可以如期在二○一八年第三季前完成所有剛才所說的三個步驟的工作",
            "多謝",
            "記者：司長，想問問是否開始討論《合作安排》，譬如你說在內地口岸區拿到那個「期」，即租的期限和費用，其實政府有否一個初步建議，那期限是多久？或費用其實是怎樣計算？另外都想問問香港人其實都很關心內地執法人員在香港執法，會否就這些內地人員在香港執法會否有另加的一些條款或條例，或可能限制他們要即日回到內地？",
            "律政司司長：或者看看稍後陳局長會否有補充",
            "據我理解，我可以回答到你的問題，就是剛才我們所說的合作安排，其實我們已經談到一個很成熟的階段，亦因為這個原因，剛才我們可以和你介紹這個合作安排所涵蓋的範圍，包括雙方設立的口岸區和範圍、法律適用和管轄權的分配、出入境時乘客的監管，還有剛才所提及的協調機制、應急機制、修改和生效",
            "這個其實便是現在雙方對這個合作安排內容的共識",
            "至於費用，正如剛才所說，大家現在有個共識，便是內地口岸區的使用權是需要繳費，但繳費的問題和其他譬如維修及其他年期，大家亦同意另外會有一個合約去處理",
            "所以費用的問題，現在是未有一個實質數字，這個日後仍然需要商討的",
            "就剛才這位記者朋友關於執法方面的問題，執法方面，我們現在的理解就是內地工作人員每一天由內地到西九工作，然後在落班時會用鐵路返回內地，不會留在香港過夜",
            "或陳局長有否其他補充？",
            "運輸及房屋局局長: 我想好像司長剛才回答，因為費用和相關細節的安排，我們仍然在討論當中，所以連同期限暫時都未有一個定論，待我們有決定的時候，若你有興趣，我們可以告訴你",
            "記者：想問關於合同方面，現在你們有個時間表會是甚麼時候簽？以及租那個費用會否傾向一個象徵式，即收少少錢便算，還是像深圳灣的模式，即數百萬一年？這是第一個問題",
            "同時，想問剛才李局長表示日常巡邏就會帶警棍，但其實會否配槍？是否只是在收到恐襲情報的情況下才會配槍？以及是否交給人大常委會做一個批示之前，都會上立法會去尋求通過一個決議案？",
            "律政司司長：或者我答最後一個部分，然後我交給陳局長答第一部分，第二部分由李局長回答",
            "其實今日我們開這個記者會，並向社會介紹及公布我們現在工作的進展的目的，正正是向香港社會交代這件事，並向香港社會介紹現在這個建議的內容，以及希望大家提出意見",
            "由現在到立法會復會，希望可以在社會上有討論，而立法會復會之後或甚至立法會復會之前，我們都會考慮以適當的形式在立法會裏進行一個討論",
            "因為特首亦講過，我們非常尊重與立法會的關係，亦尊重立法會議員就這件事的意見，所以我們一定用一個合適的方法來跟立法會做一個溝通",
            "這個絕對不會希望逃避立法會，甚至有人說是否趁立法會「放暑假」才公布（一地兩檢安排），絕對沒有這個意圖，我們一定會有一個途徑與立法會有個溝通，或者請陳局長回答（有關）費用的問題",
            "運輸及房屋局局長：多謝這位朋友的提問，費用的徵收，剛才我已說過，在此留一些時間，暫時沒有補充",
            "或者在佩槍方面，看看李局長有沒有回應",
            "保安局局長：多謝這位記者的提問",
            "我必須強調：第一，真真正正在內地口岸區因為內地的法律適用，所以在運作方面，我們必須尊重（內地）自主權，由內地的相關單位決定實際運作模式",
            "但我亦都可以說，一般來說，我了解在廣東省內的口岸，他們的運作模式亦好像我剛才所說，就算要巡邏的時候，他們一般都會配備警棍",
            "那麼他們在甚麼情況下需要添加裝備，是哪一類的裝備，一定要按實際情況由當地的機關去決定",
            "至於在香港的運作模式，亦要按實際需要而去決定我們用哪一種巡邏模式，或哪些裝備，我們都要按實際情況",
            "所以我剛才所說在一般的口岸，他們會這樣做，但在實際運作上需要作出怎樣的安排都是由有關單位按實際情況去決定",
            "但一般來說，以我的理解他們的巡邏是會用警棍的",
            "（待續）",
