            "Five law students were complimented on the high quality of their essays at the Law Reform Essay Competition 2017 Certificate Award Ceremony today (June 9).",
            "The essay competition, running for its fourth year, was organised by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) to promote the importance of law reform among law students and to provide them with an opportunity to propose how a given area of Hong Kong law may be reformed.",
            "Officiating at the ceremony, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, who is Chairman of the LRC, said the competition has become an important event of the LRC's calendar and helped foster among law students an awareness of law reform generally and the complexity of the legal and social implications involved.",
            "The topic chosen this year - \"Should Hong Kong Introduce a Good Samaritan Food Donation Law? If so, why and how?\" – involves issues of poverty alleviation, food waste and environmental impact. A record number of 55 essays were submitted.",
            "The five winners, who are studying law programmes at the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong, were each awarded a one-month or two-month attachment this summer with a leading law firm, a barristers' chambers, a commercial corporation or the Department of Justice.",
            "During the ceremony, Mr Yuen pointed out that law reform played an important role in maintaining the rule of law. The law and its enforcement are two of the key components of any legal system. Effective enforcement of the law would be meaningless, or even counter-productive, unless the contents of the law can meet the needs of the society and are just and fair. In this regard, effective law reform can ensure that the contents of the law would achieve the very objectives that should be achieved.",
            "\"Second, we are living in a fast-changing world. It is no exaggeration to say that the world and the community we are living in are changing at a pace much quicker than before. This world-wide trend makes law reform more important than ever, as law reform is the very means to ensure that the law can be kept up-to-date, and thereby continues to meet the evolving needs of the society,\" added Mr Yuen.",
            "Mr Yuen congratulated the five winners for their well argued and impressively written essays and thanked the adjudicating panel, and sponsoring law firms, barristers' chambers and commercial corporation for their valuable support in offering internships as prizes for the finalists. The five winning essays are available on the LRC's website:",

            "五名法律學生以其優秀的論文，在今日（六月九日）舉行的二○一七年法律改革徵文比賽獎狀頒發典禮中獲得嘉許。",
            "該項徵文比賽由法律改革委員會（法改會）舉辦，今年已是第四屆，旨在讓法律學生認識法律改革的重要性，並讓他們有機會就香港法律的特定範疇提出改革建議。",
            "律政司司長兼法改會主席袁國強資深大律師主持頒獎禮時表示，徵文比賽已成為法改會日誌上的一項重要活動，有助法律學生加深認識法律改革，和了解當中對法律和社會帶來的複雜影響。",
            "今年徵文比賽的題目是「香港應否引入好撒瑪利亞人食品捐贈法？如屬肯定，則理由何在和應該如何引入？」。議題涉及扶貧、廚餘和環境影響等事宜，共收到55篇參賽作品，打破歷年紀錄。",
            "五名得獎者分別在香港大學、香港中文大學和香港城市大學修讀法律課程，他們將在今年夏季分別獲派往律師行、大律師事務所、商業機構或律政司實習一或兩個月作為獎勵。",
            "袁國強在典禮上指出，法律改革在維護法治方面發揮重要作用。法律和執法是任何法律制度的兩個重要組成部分。除非法律內容能夠滿足社會的需要，並且公平公正，否則只得有效的執法是沒有意義的，甚至會適得其反。在這方面，有效的法律改革可以確保法律內容達致應有的目標。",
            "他補充說︰「再者，我們活在瞬息萬變的世界，全球和社會正以更快的節奏轉變，這環球趨勢使法律改革更形重要，因為法律改革能確保法律與時並進，及持續滿足社會不斷轉變的需要。」",
            "袁國強祝賀五名得獎者，指他們撰寫的論文論據充分、文筆出色，亦感謝評審團和贊助這次比賽的律師行、大律師事務所和商業機構鼎力支持，向得獎者提供實習職位作為獎勵。五名得獎者的優勝作品已上載法改會網站：",
