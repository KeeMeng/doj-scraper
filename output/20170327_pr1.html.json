            "In response to media enquiries on the prosecution of nine persons relating to the \"Occupy Movement\", a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) gave the following reply today (March 27):",
            "The Secretary for Justice has already pointed out when answering a question at the LegCo meeting on February 8 this year that, from around December 2014, the Prosecutions Division of the DoJ started to communicate or have working meetings with the Police and provide legal advice so as to assist the Police in their work of investigation and evidence gathering, etc. During this period, the DoJ decided how to deal with those specific cases of which investigation had been completed, including commencing judicial process against 216 persons.",
            "Further, after considering the material submitted by the Police in respect of another group of 287 arrested persons (including about 335 investigation reports, 300 witness statements, 130 hours of video recordings and 80 items of non-video exhibits) and the relevant legal issues, the DoJ provided further detailed written legal advice to the Police at the end of last year in respect of the aforesaid 287 arrestees.",
            "Today, the Police will commence the process for instituting prosecution against nine of the persons on the legal advice given by the DoJ. Such action is based purely on legal considerations as well as considerations relating to law enforcement. As the relevant judicial procedures are about to commence, it is not appropriate for the DoJ to make further specific comments.",
            "The DoJ reiterates that it will continue to uphold its constitutional duty under Article 63 of the Basic Law in handling all prosecution work (including those concerning the \"Occupy Movement\") in an impartial, professional and apolitical manner and free from any interference.",
            "Further, the DoJ stresses that prosecution matters should not be politicised, including that one should not speculate on the timing of the prosecution of people involved in the \"Occupy Movement\" from the political angle. Some people in the community surmise that action was taken against those involved in the \"Occupy Movement\" today because they were so instructed by the Chief Executive-elect, Mrs Carrie Lam. The DoJ stresses that such surmising is completely baseless and utterly untrue. When handling prosecution work, the DoJ does not give prior notice to the executive branch, nor did the DoJ give prior warning to the Chief Executive-elect, Mrs Carrie Lam, as suggested by certain rumours. As in other criminal cases, the DoJ generally endeavours to handle cases as soon as possible.",

            "就傳媒查詢九名人士將因涉及「佔領行動」而被檢控一事，律政司發言人今日（三月二十七日）作以下回應：",
            "律政司司長今年二月八日在立法會答覆提問時已指出，自從約二○一四年十二月起，律政司刑事檢控科已開始與警方進行溝通或舉行工作會議，向警方提供法律意見，並協助其調查及搜證等工作。其間就個別完成調查的事件，律政司在較早時間已決定如何處理，包括就當中216人展開司法程序。",
            "此外，在考慮警方就另外287名被捕人士提供的資料（包括約335份調查報告、300份證人口供、130小時錄像影片、以及80份非錄像證物）和研究相關法律問題後，律政司於去年年底向警方就上述287名被捕人士提供詳細書面法律意見。",
            "警方今日依據律政司的法律意見向其中九人展開刑事檢控程序，完全是基於法律和執法的考慮。由於有關的刑事法律程序即將展開，律政司不適宜就案情作進一步評論。",
            "律政司重申，檢控人員一直恪守《基本法》第六十三條下的憲制責任，以中立、專業和非政治化的態度處理所有檢控工作（包括涉及「佔領行動」的案件），不受任何干涉。",
            "再者，律政司強調，不應將刑事檢控政治化，包括不應從政治角度揣測是次展開檢控涉及「佔領行動」人士的時間。社會上有揣測今日對「佔領行動」人士採取行動，是候任行政長官林鄭月娥的指示。律政司強調，上述揣測毫無根據，更絕對與事實不符。律政司進行刑事檢控時不會向行政部門事先知會，而此次檢控行動亦沒有如傳聞中指事先通知候任行政長官林鄭月娥。正如其他刑事案件，律政司一般在盡快的情況下處理案件。",
