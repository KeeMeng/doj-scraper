            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at a media session after attending the Legislative Council meeting today (December 11):",
            "Reporter: Secretary, what do you think of the court's ruling on the mask ban? Now that officers can no longer enforce the law under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, what do you think of that?",
            "Secretary for Justice: The case is still under its judicial process, and it is sub judice, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment.",
            "Reporter: Secretary, have you offered to resign from your post and stay in London? And are you expecting to be removed from your post any time soon? Second question regarding the arson attacks targeting the courts, the slogans painted on the buildings specifically say that they do not trust the rule of law here in Hong Kong. Do you think your department has any role to play in the loss of confidence in regards to the rule of law?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Arson is a very, very serious crime, and therefore no one should try and attempt to think that they can get away with arson lightly. It can attract a life sentence. Any arson act, which I think is not just before the court, but in various other places in Hong Kong, should not be allowed to continue and should be condemned. Insofar as the attack on the court is concerned, that is even more disgraceful, and it is very sad to see that people in Hong Kong are attacking our own court, which is truly independent and has been upholding the rule of law. We, in the Department of Justice, continue to support the judicial independence as well as the rule of law in Hong Kong.",
            "As to the speculation, which is a pure speculation that has been reported recently in some social media about resignations and all the rest of it, it is a pure speculation. I urge you all, as responsible media, to check the facts and to look at evidence rather than to just repeat what has been said. Thank you very much.",
