            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) signed a secondment agreement with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) yesterday (June 29) for the secondment of a DoJ legal officer to the legal department of AIIB for 12 months commencing on August 23.",
            "Through participating in the work of international organisations, local legal talent will expand their knowledge of the operation of international organisations and broaden their horizons through learning from international law experts. It will also facilitate the sustainable development of the Hong Kong legal community and the development of Hong Kong's position as a leading international legal and dispute resolution services centre. The department is grateful to the AIIB, a multilateral development bank with members from all over the world, for providing the secondee a valuable opportunity to work in and learn from its operation.",
            "Meanwhile, the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) has also confirmed the arrangement for one counsel from the DoJ and one lawyer from the private sector to commence their six-month secondment programme in September 2021 and February 2022 respectively, under the memorandum of understanding between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the HCCH signed in December last year.",
            "The DoJ has also put in place programmes to second local legal talents to the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, and it is expected that the respective secondment will commence in the near future. The department will continue to explore with other renowned international organisations to provide Hong Kong legal professionals in both the public and private sectors with more secondment opportunities.",

            "參與國際組織的工作，不但可讓本地法律專業人員加深對國際組織運作的認識，向國際法律專家學習和拓闊視野，更是一個促使香港法律界可持續發展的關鍵因素，亦有助鞏固香港作為主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。亞投行是一所多邊發展銀行，成員來自世界各地，律政司感謝亞投行為借調人員提供寶貴的工作與學習機會。",
            "同時，海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）亦已確認安排一名政府律師和一名私人執業律師，按去年十二月香港特別行政區和海牙會議簽署有關借調計劃的諒解備忘錄，分別在今年九月和明年二月，展開為期六個月的借調計劃。",
            "借調本地法律專業人才至國際統一私法協會及聯合國國際貿易法委員會的計劃亦已成功落實，相信在不久將來會陸續展開。律政司將會繼續與其他知名國際組織探討為香港公私營界別法律專業人員提供更多借調機會。",
