            "The Basic Law provision that allows judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit on Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal (CFA) has proved to be a success, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said today (August 9) in Sydney, Australia.",
            "Speaking at a luncheon gathering organised by the Law Society of New South Wales on the first day of his visit to Australia, Mr Yuen said that the success was manifested in at least two aspects. The first aspect is the fact that so many eminent judges from other common law jurisdictions have been willing to sit on the CFA since 1997 speaks volumes for the independence enjoyed by the Judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.",
            "He also pointed to the second aspect which concerns the status of the CFA and its judgments.",
            "He said, \"During the colonial era, putting aside Privy Council decisions which were on appeal from Hong Kong, decisions made by the Hong Kong courts were hardly cited by the final appellate courts in other common law jurisdictions, nor considered as leading authorities in textbooks for practitioners or students. Since the CFA was established, we have seen a significant change of scenario.\"",
            "Mr Yuen said that it illustrates how cross-fertilisation among jurists from different common law jurisdictions can enhance the further development of common law.",
            "\"If cross-fertilisation amongst judges can generate such synergy, there is no question that cross-fertilisation amongst legal practitioners and other sectors of the legal community may likewise generate the impetus to further develop common law for the general good of the common law world,\" he said.",
            "Apart from speaking at the luncheon gathering, the Secretary also met with the Acting Governor of New South Wales and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Mr TF Bathurst, and the Acting New South Wales Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, to discuss issues of mutual concern.",
            "He met with the President of the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration, Mr Alex Baykitch, and the President of the Law Society of New South Wales, Mr Gary Ulman, to foster closer ties between the legal and arbitration sectors of Hong Kong and Australia.",
            "Mr Yuen took the opportunity to call on the Chinese Consul General in Sydney, Mr Gu Xiaojie.",
            "He will continue his visit to Sydney tomorrow (August 10). He will meet with the Attorney General of New South Wales, Ms Gabrielle Upton; the President of the Law Council of Australia, Mr Stuart Clark; and Professor of Law, Australian Catholic University, Professor Laurence Boulle. He will also meet with Hong Kong people in Sydney to brief them on the latest developments of Hong Kong.",
            "Mr Yuen will arrive in the Gold Coast on August 11 to visit the Dispute Resolution Centre at Bond University. He will then proceed to Brisbane, where he will visit the Dispute Resolution Branch, Department of Justice, Queensland, and will meet with the Attorney-General of Queensland, Ms Yvette D'Ath.",

            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（八月九日）在澳洲悉尼表示，《基本法》容許其他普通法適用地區的法官參加香港終審法院的審判的條文，已證明成功落實。",
            "袁國強於訪問澳洲首天，在新南威爾斯州律師會的午餐聚會上致辭。他說，最少有兩方面顯示條文已成功落實。第一方面，是自一九九七年以來，很多來自其他普通法適用地區的著名法官願意參加終審法院的審判，這已清楚說明香港特別行政區享有司法獨立。",
            "他亦指出第二方面是關於終審法院和其判決的地位。",
            "他說：「在殖民地時代，除了樞密院就香港提出的上訴的裁決，由香港法院作出的裁決絕少被其他普通法司法管轄區的終審上訴法庭所引用，亦不會被執業者或學生教科書視為領導權威。自終審法院成立以來，我們看到情況有顯著的變化。」",
            "袁國強說，這亦說明來自不同普通法適用地區法學家之間的交流，如何能夠促進普通法的進一步發展。",
            "他說：「如果法官之間的交流能夠產生這種協同效應，法律執業者和法律界其他界別之間的交流，無疑也能產生動力推動普通法進一步發展，為普通法地區帶來整體的好處。」",
            "除了在午餐聚會上發表講話外，袁國強亦與新南威爾斯州署理總督及新南威爾士州最高法院首席法官TF Bathurst，以及署理新南威爾斯州申訴專員John McMillan教授會面，商討共同關注事宜。",

            "袁國強將於八月十一日到黃金海岸訪問，期間會到訪邦德大學的爭議解決中心。他其後會轉抵布里斯班，到訪昆士蘭州司法部爭議解決科，並與昆士蘭州總檢察長Yvette D'Ath會面。",
