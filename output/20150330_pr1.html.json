            "Following is the transcript of remarks made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, after attending a web television programme:",
            "Reporter: Zhang Rongshun has refused to promise Hong Kong people that further changes can be made. Should Hong Kong people be worried? You know, it's just a promise. Maybe we could have universal suffrage in 2017.",
            "Secretary for Justice: If I may clarify from the very beginning. He has not refused to make any promise in the sense that he is denying the possibility of changes after 2017. If you look at the flow of his conversation or his deliberation, what he said is as a matter of law, changes can be allowed after 2017 if one can achieve universal suffrage in 2017. So he began by saying even without any changes to the law, changes can be made after universal suffrage if achieved in 2017. That is the biggest premise and the very first point that he made. What he is saying is because the law already allows you to have further changes, further improvements after 2017, therefore there is no need for any guarantee as such, or guarantee, in quotation marks, as suggested by some sectors or some people in the community. But as I was answering a similar question in Cantonese, one can also distinguish between a guarantee, a promise which may have other ramifications, such as a legal ramification. I think we can still consider whether there can be any other form of explanation by the appropriate authority, whether in Hong Kong or in the Central People's Government, so as to officially make it clear what Mr Zhang said yesterday as his first point. In other words, whether we can have some form of further explanation by certain officials that in so far as we can have paragraph 7 of Annex 1 of the Basic Law remaining in our Basic Law or as part of our Basic Law, then one can still go further or have such revision as one may think fits, after 2017, after we have implemented universal suffrage. If I may sum up, I don't think what Mr Zhang said yesterday should cause any alarm or concern on the part of the people of Hong Kong. What he is saying, if I may repeat, is that in law, one may change after 2017 as the matter now stands. Secondly, there is no need for a guarantee as such because the law already allows you to do so. But I don't think anyone is excluding the possibility that we can have further explanation in that regard. The most important point, if I may stress again, is he is saying that it is very clear, if not crystal clear term that the existing law allows you to have further changes, further improvements after 2017. I think that is the crux and most important point that he made yesterday.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（三月三十日）出席一個網台節目後與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者：早前葛珮帆議員在立法會有言論指「警察拉人，法官放人」，一個議員說這些話是否恰當呢？",
            "律政司司長︰我要聽實際葛議員當日的說法，她是複述社會上其他人士的說法或是怎樣，你這分鐘問我的問題，我可以說的是，無論社會上有甚麼看法，我絕對相信法庭只會依證據和法律辦事，所以不希望香港市民覺得法庭，或者甚至律政司在處理這些案件或其他刑事案件時，會夾雜任何政治因素，我不希望大家有這個誤會。",
            "記者：昨日張榮順說到因為《基本法》附件裏已提到將來選舉制度可修改，無須中央政府作出承諾，特區政府還有甚麼可增加市民信心，將來一定可再修改條文？",
            "律政司司長：分開三個不同層面來說，第一，在法律上，若不修改或不作表述，是否往後二○一七年落實普選後，就不能再作其他改善和優化呢？這其實一直我們的立場都很清晰。根據《基本法》附件一第七段，只要保留現時的第七段，往後二○一七年落實普選後，仍然可以再有其他優化，或行多第二步、第三步，這在法律上是很清晰的。我記得以往我出席其他場合亦有說過，這是第一方面。",
            "第二方面，現時市民或社會上有這憂慮，所以才有剛才這位朋友問是否需要有承諾這個問題。其實承諾可以是一方面，表述可以是另一方面。若然不需要作承諾，意思是不須答應，在法律上，正如我剛才所說的第一方面，已經可以改。但往後在不作承諾或不必要作承諾的情況下，有沒有其他表述，這我們仍然可以考慮。不過用甚麼方式作表述可以最令香港市民放心，這要考慮。大家要明白，若作一個承諾，在法律上一樣有其他考慮，所以，若我們的目的是希望香港市民就這事放心，表述方面我們可以如何做，不一定要去到承諾，這反而可能一方面可做到我們剛才所說的目的，另一方面在法律上更加簡化和沒有其他複雜的情況出現。",
            "記者：你剛才所說，用一種表述而不是承諾，你會寫入政改報告中，抑或官員，無論是中央官員或特區官員以口頭表述方式給予市民信心？",
            "律政司司長：為甚麼會有這個議題出現，確實是如何令市民放心，在二○一七年落實普選後，仍可作其他改善或優化。所以剛才這位傳媒朋友問的問題，確實是非常好的問題。用哪一種方式，我們仍要考慮，要看看第一，哪一個方法在法律上，第一，穩妥，第二，實際上可以最低限度香港市民覺得接受，或說得再好一點，可以令他們放心。至於哪一個做法，其實有不同方式，但最終決定如何，我們仍然在研究。",
            "記者：剛才說承諾會有法律問題，可否說清楚？如中央或特區政府作出承諾，引發出來的法律問題是甚麼？",
            "律政司司長：若我們要作一個承諾，會牽涉承諾的內容、形式，執行上的安排如何，究竟是寫在法律，或不寫在法律呢？不要用現時政改的層面，任何情況下作一個承諾，無論是個人與個人之間，或公司與公司之間，做生意、買賣的承諾，都會有這些法律上的考慮。簡單來說，做生意時有合約上的承諾，已經會有類似的考慮。若把這些法律觀念或法律上要考慮的議題放在政改上，要某人、某君或某個官員作承諾，所有這些問題都會衍生。很簡單，剛才我說的問題已經是第一個問題，找誰作出承諾呢？這些事若純粹在法律角度，先不提政治，純粹在法律角度，我們已經有很多問題要考慮，若再加上政治和實際的考慮，問題會更複雜。",
