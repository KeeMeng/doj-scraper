            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) today (February 6) issues the following statement in respect of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) case concerning Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow (FACC Nos. 8, 9 and 10 of 2017):",
            "Executive summary",
            "The three defendants were charged because of their acts, not their beliefs, in forcing their way into the the Forecourt of the Central Government Offices (Forecourt), resulting in the injuries of 10 persons. The Secretary for Justice's review of sentence was instituted in October 2016, long before the defendants have finished serving their community service orders. The DoJ welcomes the CFA's decision in:",
            "(1) finding that the Court of Appeal was right to send the message that unlawful assemblies involving violence, even a relatively low degree, will not be condoned and may justifiably attract sentences of immediate imprisonment in the future; and",
            "(2) explaining that little weight will be given to the mitigation that the offending act was committed in the exercise of constitutional rights or acts of civil disobedience because the fact of a conviction will necessarily mean the offender has crossed the line separating the lawful exercise of his constitutional rights from unlawful activity subject to sanctions and constraints.",
            "Background",
            "On September 26, 2014, the organisations to which each of the defendants, Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow, belonged held a notified assembly at an area at Tim Mei Avenue outside the Forecourt. Two applications dated September 8 and 15, 2014 made by the said organisation for holding the assembly inside the Forecourt were rejected. Since September 10, 2014, fences were constructed surrounding the Forecourt. On September 26, 2014, both gates of the fence at the Forecourt were closed for security reasons, and security guards were on duty both inside and outside the gates.",
            "The notified assembly was scheduled to end at 10pm on September 26, 2014. At around 10.24pm, Joshua Wong at the stage appealed to the public and said \"Now, here we call on you, we hope you all enter the Civic Square together with us now\". He passed the stage to Nathan Law who continued to appeal to the public to enter the Forecourt. Joshua Wong then rushed to the Forecourt, passed the gate and then climbed over the fence and jumped into the Forecourt. About one minute later, Alex Chow climbed over the fence and down into the Forecourt and joined the other participants without being apprehended by the Police. At the same time, several hundred participants of the assembly either climbed over the fence or tried to force open the closed gates of the Forecourt. They ignored the security guards and the Police who tried to stop them and forced their way into the Forecourt. In the process, 10 security guards were injured as a result of the violence involved in the incident, with one of them suffering from bone fracture requiring the taking of sick leave for a number of days.",
            "The defendants were convicted after trial of either taking part in or inciting others to take part in the unlawful assembly. They were convicted not because they exercised their civil liberties, but because of their disorderly, intimidating, or provocative conduct at the time which constituted the offence of unlawful assembly (or in the case of Nathan Law, inciting others to do so) and contravened the law. The incident involved violence and no society which truly respects the rule of law would allow the use of violence.",
            "Having convicted the defendants after trial, the Magistrate sentenced Joshua Wong and Nathan Law to 80 and 120 hours of community service order respectively, and Alex Chow to three weeks' imprisonment suspended for one year in order not to disrupt Alex Chow's plan to study abroad.",
            "The application for review of sentences was not instituted after the defendants had served their original sentences. The appeal of the sentences by the Secretary for Justice proceeds by way of an application for review of sentence in accordance with sections 81A and 81B of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. Leave of such review is required and the court shall not review the sentence unless the appeal against conviction has been withdrawn or disposed of.",
            "The defendants appealed but the appeals were withdrawn on April 19, 2017. Thereafter, the review of sentences before the Court of Appeal was fixed for a hearing on August 9, 2017.",
            "DoJ welcomes the CFA's judgment that it was right for the Court of Appeal to send the message that unlawful assemblies involving violence, even a relatively low degree, will not be condoned and may justifiably attract sentences of immediate imprisonment in the future, given the gravamen of the offence involving the instigation of a risk and fear of a breach of the peace by virtue of the number of protesters involved.",
            "DoJ also notes that the CFA, after repeating what were said in Chow Nok Hang (2013) 16 HKCFAR 837 at paragraph 39, explained that a submission in mitigation of the offence of unlawful assembly that the act was committed in the exercise of the constitutional rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly will be unlikely to carry any significant weight because the fact of a conviction will necessarily mean that the offender has crossed the line separating the lawful exercise of his constitutional rights from unlawful activity subject to sanctions and constraints. This is all the more so when the facts of the offending involve violence, in particular on the part of the offender himself, since there is no constitutional justification for violent unlawful behaviour. Similar considerations apply to the contention that it is a mitigating factor that the offence was committed by way of an act of civil disobedience.",
            "It can also be seen from paragraph 5 of and the reasoning contained in the judgment of the CFA that the Court dealt with this case solely from the legal perspective. Hence, suggestions that the application for review was politically motivated were totally groundless and misconceived.",

            "就終審法院今日（二月六日）處理黃之鋒、羅冠聰和周永康一案（FACC Nos. 8, 9,10/2017），律政司發表以下聲明︰",
            "撮要",
            "三名被告被檢控是基於他們強行進入政府總部前地（前地）而引致十人受傷的行為，並非由於他們的信念。律政司司長早於二○一六年十月，亦即是遠較被告完成社會服務令之前，已提出刑期覆核。律政司歡迎終審法院作出以下的決定：",
            "（一）上訴法庭所傳達的信息是正確的，就是當非法集結涉及暴力，即使涉及相對較低程度的暴力，也不會被容忍，在未來亦可能合理地招致即時監禁的刑罰；以及",
            "（二）解釋以行使憲法權利或公民抗命之名來為違法行為求情，所給予比重將會很少，因為被定罪必然是指罪犯已逾越了合法行使其憲法權利，以及被制裁和限制非法活動之間的界線。",
            "背景",
            "案發在二○一四年九月二十六日，黃之鋒、羅冠聰及周永康三人各自所屬的團體，於政府總部前地外添美道對出的地段舉行已通知警方的集會。有關團體於二○一四年九月八日和十五日兩度申請在前地內舉行集會，但申請被拒。自二○一四年九月十日起，前地周邊進行加建圍欄的工程。二○一四年九月二十六日，前地圍欄的兩個閘門因保安原因而關閉，保安人員於閘門內外當值。",
            "該個已通知警方的集會原訂於二○一四年九月二十六日晚上十時結束。約十時二十四分，黃之鋒在講台上號召集會人士，並說：「好，我地而家喺度呼籲，希望大家而家同我哋一齊入去公民廣場。」黃之鋒隨後將講台主持的崗位交予羅冠聰，羅冠聰則繼續號召人們進入前地。黃之鋒跟着跑向前地，攀越圍欄，從欄頂躍下前地。約一分鐘後，周永康亦攀越圍欄，躍下前地，避開警員阻截而和其他參與者一起。同時，數百名參與集會人士攀越圍欄，或試圖強行打開前地已關上的大閘。保安人員和警方嘗試制止他們，他們並沒理會，而強行進入前地。過程中，十名保安人員因在事件中涉及的暴力而受傷，其中一人骨折，需放病假多天。",
            "三名被告因參與或煽惑他人參與非法集結的罪名，經審訊後被判罪成。他們被定罪，並非因為他們行使公民權利，而是因為他們當時的擾亂秩序、有威嚇性及挑撥性的行為，構成非法集結的罪行（或在羅冠聰個案中的煽惑他人作出這行為），違反法律。事件涉及暴力，沒有一個真誠尊重法治的社會會容許使用暴力。",
            "裁判官在審判後將被告人定罪，判黃之鋒、羅冠聰分別80及120小時社會服務令，周永康則被判監禁3個星期，緩刑1年，以免影響他海外升學的計劃。",
            "刑期覆核申請並非在被告完成原來的刑罰後才提出。律政司司長根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81A及81B條的規定，提出刑期覆核申請，而此類覆核需要許可，除非該上訴已撤回或獲處置，否則上訴法庭不得覆核刑罰。",
            "在本案中，被告曾提出上訴，但於二○一七年四月十九日撤銷其上訴。其後，上訴法庭安排刑期覆核聆訊於二○一七年八月九日進行。",
            "律政司歡迎終審法院的裁決，指上訴法庭所傳達的信息是正確的，就是當非法集結涉及暴力，即使涉及相對較低程度的暴力，也不會被容忍，在未來亦可能合理地招致即時監禁的刑罰，因為罪行的控訴要旨是集結的人仗着人多勢眾而引起破壞社會安寧的風險與擔憂。",
            "律政司亦注意到，終審法院重提周諾恆（2013）16 HKCFAR 837一案第39段後解釋，以行使言論自由和集會自由的憲法權利之名，為所犯的非法集結罪行作為求情，將不大可能給予顯著的比重，因為被定罪必然是指罪犯已經逾越了合法行使其憲法權利，以及被制裁和限制非法活動之間的界線。尤其是當犯罪行為涉及暴力時，特別是罪犯本身涉及暴力，因為沒有任何違法的暴力行為是合符憲法保障的。相同的考慮亦適用於以公民抗命之名犯罪作為減刑因素的論點。",
            "從終審法院的判決第五段以及判詞中的理據也可見到，法庭只從法律角度處理此案。因此，任何有關指覆核申請是基於政治動機的說法，是毫無根據和出於誤解的。",
