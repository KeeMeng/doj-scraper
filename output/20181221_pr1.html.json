            "The following is a statement issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr David Leung, SC, today (December 21) on the case of Houses 3 and 4, Villa de Mer, Tuen Mun (the houses owned by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, and her husband Mr Otto Poon Lok-to):",
            "Introduction",
            "On December 27, 2017, the Buildings Department (BD) received a media enquiry about suspected unauthorised building works (UBWs) at certain units at Villa de Mer, 5 Lok Chui Street, Tuen Mun, including Houses 3 and 4 (House 3 and House 4 respectively). At the material times, House 4 was owned by a company with the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC (Ms Cheng), as the sole director, while House 3 was owned by Mr Otto Poon Lok-to (Mr Poon), the husband of Ms Cheng, and Ms Karen Poon Wing-yun (Ms Poon).",
            "In early January 2018, in order to avoid any possible perception of bias, partiality or improper influence, the Secretary for Justice delegated to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Mr David Leung, SC, the authority to handle all prosecutorial matters relating to any reports, allegations and complaints in the matter, including (should it become necessary to do so) the decision as to whether any prosecution action should be commenced against any persons involved in the present case.",
            "On January 9, 2018, BD officers conducted an on-site inspection of both Houses 3 and 4 and identified various UBWs. After conducting investigation and preparing the necessary investigation report and seeking experts' opinion, on November 23, 2018, BD submitted the investigation file to the Prosecutions Division of the DoJ for legal advice. BD recommended prosecuting Mr and Ms Poon in respect of the UBW at House 3 but not prosecuting Ms Cheng in respect of the UBWs at House 4.",
            "To avoid possible perception of bias, the DPP decided to instruct a Senior Counsel at the Bar of Hong Kong. On November 29, 2018, the DPP instructed Mr Edwin Choy, SC, who has no conflict of interest in this case, to provide an independent opinion on the sufficiency of evidence to institute a criminal prosecution in relation to the UBWs at House 3 and House 4.",
            "On December 19, 2018, the DPP received a finalised advice from Mr Choy who advised that while there is a reasonable prospect of conviction against Mr Poon for the UBW, namely a pool structure (approximate size 2.5metres x 4.65m x 1.24m(H)), at House 3, there was insufficient evidence to establish a reasonable prospect of conviction against (1) Ms Cheng in relation to the UBWs at House 4 and (2) Ms Poon in relation to the UBWs at House 3.",
            "Having considered the advice of the Senior Counsel, the evidence submitted by BD, the applicable law and the principles in the Prosecution Code, the DPP agreed that there was insufficient evidence and hence no reasonable prospect of conviction against (1) Ms Cheng with regard to the UBWs at House 4 and (2) Ms Poon in relation to the UBWs at House 3, but there is a reasonable prospect of conviction against Mr Poon for the UBW at House 3.",
            "Since the UBWs in respect of House 3 came to the notice of BD on December 27, 2017, pursuant to section 40(8) of the Buildings Ordinance, Cap 123, the time limit for prosecution falls on December 27, 2018. In this regard, information has been laid to apply for summons against Mr Poon for the offence of \"Knowingly commenced or carried out building works, without having first obtained from the Building Authority his approval and consent in writing\" contrary to sections 14(1) and 40(1AA) of the Buildings Ordinance, Cap 123.",
            "Prosecution Criteria",
            "According to the Prosecution Code, a prosecutor must consider two issues in deciding whether to prosecute. First, whether there is sufficient evidence to justify instituting or continuing proceedings. Second, if there is sufficient evidence, whether the public interest requires a prosecution to be pursued. A prosecution should not be instituted or continued unless the prosecutor is satisfied that there is legally sufficient evidence to support a prosecution: that is, evidence that is admissible and reliable and, together with any reasonable inference able to be drawn from it, likely to prove the offence. The test is whether the evidence demonstrates a reasonable prospect of conviction. In the present case, the decision not to prosecute is solely based upon insufficiency of evidence.",
            "For an offence contrary to sections 14(1) and 40(1AA), the prosecution must prove that the subject person has knowingly commenced or carried out any building works without having first obtained from the Building Authority his approval and consent in writing. In the present case, the main issues are (a) whether the UBWs identified at the respective houses were built after Mr and Ms Poon and Ms Cheng had assumed ownership of their respective properties; and (b) if so, whether they knew (i) those structures were built on their respective property at the material time; and (ii) they were built without the requisite consent or approval.",
            "House 3",
            "As the proceedings against Mr Poon in respect of the UBW at House 3 have been instituted, it is not appropriate to comment further on the matter or the detailed reasons of insufficiency of evidence against Ms Poon.",
            "House 4",
            "The BD has identified the following UBWs at House 4:",
            "(a) a rooftop structure, a horizontal extension at the Ground Floor, an L-shape glass canopy outside G/F carpark, a garden deck, a small canopy and cover screens;",
            "(b) a basement; and",
            "(c) other relatively small UBWs, including:",
            "For the rooftop structure, the horizontal extension at the Ground Floor, the L-shape glass canopy outside G/F carpark, the garden deck, the small canopy and cover screens, aerial photographs taken in November 2007 and July 2008 show that these UBWs had been constructed before Ms Cheng's company became the registered owner of House 4 on October 23, 2008.",
            "For the basement, according to expert opinion, there is no reliable testing method capable of assessing the age of concrete structure to a precise period of time. Judging solely on the existing condition of the concrete structure, it is not possible to evaluate or estimate the date of construction of the basement. There is also other evidence which suggests that the basement had been constructed before Ms Cheng purchased House 4. For the reasons set out in paragraph 23.4(d) and (e) of the Prosecution Code (Note 1), it would be inappropriate to divulge details of such other evidence.",
            "For the other relatively small UBWs, it is not possible to ascertain from the aerial photographs or other available evidence when they were constructed.",
            "Other alterations and modifications found at House 4, for example, the door opening at the fence wall between House 3 and House 4, are exempted works under section 41 of the Buildings Ordinance, Cap 123.",
            "Mr Choy, having carefully considered all the available evidence and materials, advised that there was no evidence to suggest that the UBWs were constructed after Ms Cheng had purchased House 4 or that she had knowingly commenced or carried out UBWs after she became the owner. Hence, Mr Choy concluded there was insufficient evidence to warrant a charge of \"Knowingly commenced or carried out building works, without having first obtained from the Building Authority his approval and consent in writing\" contrary to sections 14(1) and 40(1AA) of the Buildings Ordinance, Cap 123, against Ms Cheng.",
            "The decision not to institute prosecution against Ms Cheng in respect of the above UBWs has been made in accordance with the Prosecution Code and the applicable law.",
            "Disclosure of Reasons for Decision",
            "The decision taken has been explained, in accordance with the principles in paragraph 23 of the Prosecution Code, so that the public are fully and properly informed about this case which has been the subject of public concern.",

            "以下是刑事檢控專員梁卓然資深大律師今日（十二月二十一日）就屯門海詩別墅3號及4號屋事件（律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師及其丈夫潘樂陶所擁有的屋宇）一案所作的聲明：",
            "引言",
            "於二○一七年十二月二十七日，屋宇署接獲傳媒查詢有關屯門樂翠街五號海詩別墅的部分單位（包括3及4號屋）的懷疑僭建物。在相關時候，4號屋由一家公司擁有，而律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師（鄭若驊）為該公司的唯一董事；3號屋的業主則為鄭若驊的丈夫潘樂陶以及潘穎欣。",
            "在二○一八年一月初，為了避免可能產生任何偏頗或不當影響的印象，律政司司長授權刑事檢控專員梁卓然資深大律師（刑事檢控專員）處理所有與該事件有關的報告、指控和投訴的檢控事宜，包括在有需要時，決定是否應對涉案的任何人士作出檢控。",
            "二○一八年一月九日，屋宇署人員對3及4號屋進行現場視察，並發現多個僭建物。在作出調查、準備所需調查報告並尋求專家意見後，屋宇署於二○一八年十一月二十三日將調查檔案提交律政司刑事檢控科，以徵詢法律意見。屋宇署建議有關3號屋的僭建物，檢控潘樂陶和潘穎欣，但就4號屋的僭建物則不對鄭若驊作出檢控。",
            "為了避免可能產生任何偏頗印象，刑事檢控專員決定委託一名香港的資深大律師提供法律意見。刑事檢控專員於二○一八年十一月二十九日委託在該事件中沒有利益衝突的蔡維邦資深大律師就3號和4號屋的僭建物，是否有足夠證據提出刑事檢控而提供獨立法律意見。",
            "二○一八年十二月十九日，刑事檢控專員收到蔡維邦大律師的最終法律意見。蔡維邦大律師表示就潘樂陶有關3號屋的僭建物，即一個水池構築物（大約尺寸為2.5米x4.65米x1.24米（高度）），有合理機會達致定罪，但就（1）鄭若驊有關4號屋的僭建物和（2）潘穎欣有關3號屋的僭建物，則無足夠證據支持合理機會達致定罪。",
            "在考慮了資深大律師的意見、屋宇署提交的證據、適用法律及《檢控守則》的原則後，刑事檢控專員同意沒有足夠的證據支持合理機會就（1）鄭若驊有關4號屋的僭建物和（2）潘穎欣有關3號屋的僭建物，達致定罪，但是就潘樂陶有關3號屋的僭建物，則有合理機會達致定罪。",
            "由於屋宇署在二○一七年十二月二十七日獲悉3號屋的僭建物，根據《建築物條例》（第123章）第40（8）條，檢控時限於二○一八年十二月二十七日屆滿。就此，有關方面已提出告發，就潘樂陶違反《建築物條例》（第123章）第14（1）及40（1AA）條 ，「明知未事先獲得建築事務監督的書面批准及書面同意，便展開或進行建築工程」 申請傳票 。",
            "檢控準則",
            "根據《檢控守則》，檢控人員在決定應否提出檢控時須考慮兩大問題：第一，是否有充分證據支持提出和繼續進行檢控。第二，若有充分證據，進行檢控是否符合公眾利益。除非檢控人員信納在法律上有充分證據支持提出檢控，即這些可接納和可靠的證據，連同可從相關證據作出的合理推論，有相當機會能證明有關罪行，否則不應提出或繼續進行檢控。而驗證標準則為是否有合理機會達致定罪。就本案而言，不對上述人士提出檢控的決定完全是建基於證據不足的考慮。",
            "就違反第14（1）及40（1AA）條的罪行而言，控方必須證明有關人士在明知未事先獲得建築事務監督書面批准及書面同意的情況下，便展開或進行任何建築工程。在本案中，主要爭議點是（1）在潘樂陶和潘穎欣及鄭若驊各自的屋宇內發現的僭建物，是否在他們各取得其物業擁有權後才建造；及（2）如果是，他們是否知悉（i）在關鍵時間，其各自的物業上建有該等構築物；及（ii）該等構築物是未獲所需的同意或批准而建造。",
            "3號屋",
            "由於就潘樂陶有關3號屋的僭建物提出的檢控程序已經展開，因此不宜就此事作出進一步評論或就沒有足夠證據檢控潘穎欣提供詳盡理由。",
            "4號屋",
            "屋宇署在4號屋發現以下僭建物：",
            "（1）天台屋、地下樓層外牆擴建物、地下車房對出L形玻璃簷篷、花園覆蓋甲板、小簷篷及遮蔽屏風；",
            "（2）地庫；及",
            "（3）其他較小型僭建物，包括：",
            "根據二○○七年十一月及二○○八年七月拍攝的航空照片顯示，天台屋、地下樓層外牆擴建物、地下車房對出L形玻璃簷篷、花園覆蓋甲板、小簷篷及遮蔽屏風這些僭建物是在鄭若驊的公司於二○○八年十月二十三日成為有關物業的登記業主之前已經建成的。",
            "對於地庫，根據專家意見，沒有可靠的測試方法能夠將混凝土結構的年齡評估在一段精確的時間內。僅根據混凝土結構的現有狀況判斷，不可能評估或估計地庫的建造日期。此外，亦有其他證據指出，鄭若驊在購買4號屋之前，地庫已經建成。基於《檢控守則》 第23.4（d）及（e）段（註一）所列的原因，不適宜在本聲明透露這些其他證據的詳細資料。",
            "其他較小型僭建物無法從航空照片或其他現有證據中查明其建造時期。",
            "4號屋發現的其他更改和改裝，例如設於分隔3號屋及4號屋圍牆的門口，均屬《建築物條例》（第123章）第41條所指的豁免工程。",
            "蔡維邦大律師在仔細考慮所有證據及資料後，認為沒有證據顯示有關的僭建物是在鄭若驊購買4號屋後建造的，或是在她成為物業擁有人之後明知而展開或進行的違例建築工程。因此，蔡維邦大律師的結論是，沒有足夠的證據足以支持檢控鄭若驊違反《建築物條例》（第123章）第14（1）及40（1AA）條，即「明知未事先獲得建築事務監督的書面批准及書面同意，便展開或進行建築工程」。",
            "就上述僭建物對鄭若驊作出不檢控的決定，完全是根據《檢控守則》及適用法律。",
            "披露作出有關決定的原因",
            "上述案件的決定是根據《檢控守則》第23段的原則而作出解釋，以讓市民對這宗公眾關注的案件有全面和充分的了解。",

            "屋宇署建議有關3號屋的僭建物，檢控潘樂陶和潘穎欣，但就4號屋的僭建物則不對鄭若驊作出檢控",
            "為了避免可能產生任何偏頗印象，刑事檢控專員決定委託一名香港的資深大律師提供法律意見",
            "刑事檢控專員於二○一八年十一月二十九日委託在該事件中沒有利益衝突的蔡維邦資深大律師就3號和4號屋的僭建物，是否有足夠證據提出刑事檢控而提供獨立法律意見",
            "二○一八年十二月十九日，刑事檢控專員收到蔡維邦大律師的最終法律意見",
            "蔡維邦大律師表示就潘樂陶有關3號屋的僭建物，即一個水池構築物（大約尺寸為2.5米x4.65米x1.24米（高度）），有合理機會達致定罪，但就（1）鄭若驊有關4號屋的僭建物和（2）潘穎欣有關3號屋的僭建物，則無足夠證據支持合理機會達致定罪",
            "在考慮了資深大律師的意見、屋宇署提交的證據、適用法律及《檢控守則》的原則後，刑事檢控專員同意沒有足夠的證據支持合理機會就（1）鄭若驊有關4號屋的僭建物和（2）潘穎欣有關3號屋的僭建物，達致定罪，但是就潘樂陶有關3號屋的僭建物，則有合理機會達致定罪",
            "由於屋宇署在二○一七年十二月二十七日獲悉3號屋的僭建物，根據《建築物條例》（第123章）第40（8）條，檢控時限於二○一八年十二月二十七日屆滿",
            "就此，有關方面已提出告發，就潘樂陶違反《建築物條例》（第123章）第14（1）及40（1AA）條 ，「明知未事先獲得建築事務監督的書面批准及書面同意，便展開或進行建築工程」 申請傳票",
            "檢控準則",
            "根據《檢控守則》，檢控人員在決定應否提出檢控時須考慮兩大問題：第一，是否有充分證據支持提出和繼續進行檢控",
            "第二，若有充分證據，進行檢控是否符合公眾利益",
            "除非檢控人員信納在法律上有充分證據支持提出檢控，即這些可接納和可靠的證據，連同可從相關證據作出的合理推論，有相當機會能證明有關罪行，否則不應提出或繼續進行檢控",
            "而驗證標準則為是否有合理機會達致定罪",
            "就本案而言，不對上述人士提出檢控的決定完全是建基於證據不足的考慮",
            "就違反第14（1）及40（1AA）條的罪行而言，控方必須證明有關人士在明知未事先獲得建築事務監督書面批准及書面同意的情況下，便展開或進行任何建築工程",
            "在本案中，主要爭議點是（1）在潘樂陶和潘穎欣及鄭若驊各自的屋宇內發現的僭建物，是否在他們各取得其物業擁有權後才建造；及（2）如果是，他們是否知悉（i）在關鍵時間，其各自的物業上建有該等構築物；及（ii）該等構築物是未獲所需的同意或批准而建造",
            "3號屋",
            "由於就潘樂陶有關3號屋的僭建物提出的檢控程序已經展開，因此不宜就此事作出進一步評論或就沒有足夠證據檢控潘穎欣提供詳盡理由",
            "4號屋",
            "屋宇署在4號屋發現以下僭建物：",
            "（1）天台屋、地下樓層外牆擴建物、地下車房對出L形玻璃簷篷、花園覆蓋甲板、小簷篷及遮蔽屏風；",
            "（2）地庫；及",
            "（3）其他較小型僭建物，包括：",
            "根據二○○七年十一月及二○○八年七月拍攝的航空照片顯示，天台屋、地下樓層外牆擴建物、地下車房對出L形玻璃簷篷、花園覆蓋甲板、小簷篷及遮蔽屏風這些僭建物是在鄭若驊的公司於二○○八年十月二十三日成為有關物業的登記業主之前已經建成的",
            "對於地庫，根據專家意見，沒有可靠的測試方法能夠將混凝土結構的年齡評估在一段精確的時間內",
            "僅根據混凝土結構的現有狀況判斷，不可能評估或估計地庫的建造日期",
            "此外，亦有其他證據指出，鄭若驊在購買4號屋之前，地庫已經建成",
            "基於《檢控守則》 第23.4（d）及（e）段（註一）所列的原因，不適宜在本聲明透露這些其他證據的詳細資料",
            "其他較小型僭建物無法從航空照片或其他現有證據中查明其建造時期",
            "4號屋發現的其他更改和改裝，例如設於分隔3號屋及4號屋圍牆的門口，均屬《建築物條例》（第123章）第41條所指的豁免工程",
            "蔡維邦大律師在仔細考慮所有證據及資料後，認為沒有證據顯示有關的僭建物是在鄭若驊購買4號屋後建造的，或是在她成為物業擁有人之後明知而展開或進行的違例建築工程",
            "因此，蔡維邦大律師的結論是，沒有足夠的證據足以支持檢控鄭若驊違反《建築物條例》（第123章）第14（1）及40（1AA）條，即「明知未事先獲得建築事務監督的書面批准及書面同意，便展開或進行建築工程」",
            "就上述僭建物對鄭若驊作出不檢控的決定，完全是根據《檢控守則》及適用法律",
            "披露作出有關決定的原因",
            "上述案件的決定是根據《檢控守則》第23段的原則而作出解釋，以讓市民對這宗公眾關注的案件有全面和充分的了解",
