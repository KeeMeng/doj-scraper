            "In light of comments arising from the conviction of seven defendants who were charged with \"organising an unauthorised assembly\" and \"knowingly taking part in an unauthorised assembly\" at the District Court yesterday, the Department of Justice (DoJ) today (April 2) issued the following statement:",
            "No one should comment on cases in respect of which legal proceedings are still ongoing as the matter is sub judice.",
            "We must reiterate that prosecutorial decisions made by the DoJ are based on evidence, applicable laws and the Prosecution Code. The Prosecution Code explicitly stipulates that prosecutors must not be influenced by political, media or individual interest. Cases are handled with the same benchmark irrespective of the political beliefs or background of defendants. Prosecution would only be commenced and continued if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to do so. Article 63 of the Basic Law expressly guarantees that all prosecutions are free from any interference.",
            "The Government respects and attaches great importance to the rights and freedoms (including the freedoms of assembly, of procession and of demonstration) protected under the Basic Law. However, such rights and freedoms are not absolute and maybe subject to restrictions which are, amongst others, in the interests of public order (ordre public) and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Over the years, notified public processions and public meetings have taken place peacefully and orderly.",
            "It is regrettable to note that the convictions have drawn unfair criticisms with political overtones. Any assertion to suggest that \"Beijing eroding Hong Kong's freedoms\" is totally baseless. Under the Basic Law, criminal prosecutions are handled by the DoJ independently.",
            "The judgment has set out the reasons for the verdict which is publicly available at the Judiciary's website (legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/ju/ju_frame.jsp?DIS=134671&currpage=T). Members of the public are well advised to read the judgment so as to be properly and fairly informed.",

            "就區域法院昨日裁定七名被告「組織一個未經批准集結」和「明知而參與未經批准集結」罪名成立所引起的評論，律政司今日（四月二日）發出以下聲明：",
            "基於迴避待決案件（sub judice）的法律原則，任何人都不應評論司法程序尚在進行的案件。",
            "我們必須重申，所有檢控決定均是按證據、適用法律和《檢控守則》作出。《檢控守則》明確指出檢控人員不應受任何涉及政治、傳媒或個人利益的因素影響。不論被告的政治理念或背景，律政司會以同等的尺度處理案件。律政司在有充分可被法院接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪，及在合乎公眾利益的情況下，才會提出及繼續起訴。《基本法》第六十三條明確指出刑事檢察工作不受任何干涉。",
            "政府一直尊重及重視《基本法》保障的權利和自由（包括集會、遊行和示威自由），但這些權利和自由並非絕對，是可受到限制，包括基於公共秩序及保障他人的權利和自由。過去多年，已提出通知的公眾集會和遊行一直和平有序地進行。",
            "令人遺憾的是，案件引來了一些基於政治理由而作出的無理批評。任何主張指「北京侵蝕香港自由」都是毫無理據，根據《基本法》，律政司獨立地主管刑事檢察的工作。",
