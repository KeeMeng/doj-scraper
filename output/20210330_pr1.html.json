            "The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) today (March 30) passed the amended Annex I \"Method for the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\" and Annex II \"Method for the Formation of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Its Voting Procedures\" to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China. The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, issued the following statement:",
            "I welcome and support the passage by the NPCSC on the amended Annex I and Annex II to the Basic Law for improving the electoral system of the HKSAR. By ensuring that \"one country, two systems\" is implemented on the right track, the constitutional order as set out by the Constitution and the Basic Law will be effectively safeguarded, thereby achieving the long-term stability, prosperity and safety of the HKSAR.",
            "The Central Authorities proactively collected views from various sectors of Hong Kong within a short period of time. The views have been thoroughly considered by the NPCSC. The increase in the size and composition of the Election Committee and the Legislative Council reflect a more balanced and orderly political participation as well as a broader representation of society, signifying an important move to advance the HKSAR's democratic electoral system.",
            "The HKSAR Government will complete local legislation and relevant legislative amendments in accordance with the amended Annex I and Annex II to the Basic Law. I will lead the Department of Justice to render full support to the Government's work with a view to improving the electoral system as early as possible to enhance the governance efficacy of the HKSAR.",
