            "Following is the English translation of the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, who spoke to the media on the Snowden case today (June 25):",
            "Secretary for Justice: Dear friends from the media, since the Department of Justice (DOJ) has received a lot of enquiries from the media regarding the Snowden case in the past two days, I would like to take this opportunity to speak to you on a number of matters:",
            "First, as I explained before, the surrender of fugitive offenders between the United States and Hong Kong is governed by the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (Chapter 503, Laws of Hong Kong) and the Agreement between the United States and Hong Kong made in December 1996. Any request by the United States for the surrender of fugitive offenders or related request, including that for a provisional warrant of arrest, is governed by the above Ordinance and Agreement.",
            "One of the legal requirements is that any criminal charge made by the US Government must be a criminal offence falling within the offences set out in Article 2 of the Agreement and that the relevant conduct also constitutes an offence under Hong Kong law. If either of these two conditions is not satisfied, no surrender can be made. A third consideration is that the request for surrender must not involve any political offence or prosecution of a person on account of his political opinion.",
            "Regarding the Snowden case, the DOJ did receive a request for the issue of a provisional warrant of arrest from the US, but not a formal request for the surrender of fugitive offenders.",
            "The documents requesting the issue of the provisional warrant were received in the afternoon on 15 June (Saturday) (Note 1). The documents revealed that the US Government was filing three charges of unauthorised disclosure of national defence information, unauthorised disclosure of communication intelligence information and theft of state property, i.e. the related information, against Mr Snowden. On receipt of these documents, counsel in the International Law Division of the DOJ examined the documents immediately so as to verify whether the criminal accusations against Mr Snowden by the US Government satisfy the relevant legal requirements, and review if other basic information required was sufficient.",
            "On 17 June (Monday), colleagues in the DOJ notified the US Department of Justice by email that Hong Kong was preparing a list of questions to seek clarification of the relevant information required.",
            "On 19 June, the US Department of Justice asked to get in touch with me. In response to the request, I spoke with the US Attorney General in the morning of 20 June (Hong Kong time). In the brief call, I put two points across clearly to the US Attorney General:",
            "Firstly, in handling the request for the provisional warrant from the US, we would act strictly in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and the Agreement made between Hong Kong and the US in 1996; secondly, due to the complexity of the case, colleagues in the DOJ would need some time for processing it, nevertheless a reply would be given as soon as possible. I pointed out that our request for information was expected to be handed over to the US by last Friday (Hong Kong time).",
            "On the morning of 21 June (Friday), the SAR Government wrote to the US Government through the Security Bureau, seeking clarification on the reported hacking into Hong Kong computer systems by US government agencies. In the afternoon of the same day (21 June), (i.e. Friday morning US time), the DOJ sent a letter to the US Department of Justice by email and courier service requesting further information in respect of matters of the following areas from US Government pursuant to its request for the provisional warrant:",
            "Firstly, of the criminal charges laid against Mr Snowden, in particular the first two charges of unauthorised disclosure of national defense information and communication intelligence information, under which item(s) of Article 2 of the Agreement between the United States and Hong Kong made in 1996 did the US Government consider they could fall under ? As I just said, the request for surrender could only be made if the charges against Mr Snowden fell under the offences specified in Article 2. Therefore we requested clarification of the specific item(s) under Article 2 that they were relying on.",
            "Secondly, we requested information on certain legal issues relating to the evidence to be relied on by the US Government. As the documents did not specify what evidence they would be using and certain related issues would arise under the law of Hong Kong, clarification was necessary.",
            "Thirdly, there was some other basic information which required clarification. Regarding this, I can give two examples. For instance, there are discrepancies in the English names of Mr Snowden as per the information and documents we have. The name shown on the Diplomatic Note is Edward James Snowden, while the name appeared in our movement record is Edward Joseph Snowden. That means the middle name as shown on the diplomatic documents is James and that in the movement record is Joseph. In addition, the name shown on the US court documents handed over by the US Department of Justice is simply Edward J. Snowden. As the three names were not entirely the same, we were of the view that clarification was necessary. Otherwise legal issues would arise on the issuing of the provisional warrant.",
            "Also, we noted that the documents from the US mentioned that Mr Snowden held a US passport. However, the documents did not provide the passport number. We consider that the passport number is relevant information for identification purpose. In view of this, apart from the other legal issues I just mentioned, including criminal offence, evidence etc, we also asked the US Department of Justice to provide the requisite basic information in this area.",
            "Besides, as I said just now, the media reported on the hacking into computer systems in Hong Kong by US government agencies. This matter was also raised with the US Department of Justice in our letter requesting further information issued last Friday afternoon, as we would take it into account when considering whether the charges brought by the US Government against Mr Snowden would be regarded as one of political offence, or whether Mr Snowden would be subject to prosecution by the US Government on account of his political opinion. For this reason, we considered that it was necessary to seek clarification from the US Government.",
            "As we all know, last Sunday morning (23 June), Mr Snowden left Hong Kong on his own accord through a lawful and normal channel. Up to the very moment of his departure from Hong Kong, the US had not responded to the DOJ's request for further information. Hence the DOJ could not and did not have any legal basis to seek the issue of the provisional warrant of arrest from our judge under the legal system of Hong Kong. Without a provisional arrest warrant the HKSAR Government had no legal basis to restrict or prohibit Mr Snowden's departure from Hong Kong.",
            "The approach and standards adopted in handling the matter by the DOJ has all along been very clear. The DOJ did not deliberately let Mr Snowden go away, nor did it deliberately delay processing the US's request. On the contrary, as I said just now, we all along dealt with the matter in accordance with the law of Hong Kong, the Agreement between the US and Hong Kong and the spirit of the rule of law. Also, as I just briefly put, communication with the relevant US departments was maintained all along.",
            "Up till now, the US Government has not replied to the Security Bureau's letter sent last Friday seeking clarification on the reported hacking into Hong Kong computer systems by US government agencies, or the DOJ's letter sent last Friday which also raised issues concerning the hacking. The US Government has so far not given any reply to the Security Bureau or the DOJ.",
            "As an international financial, economic and information centre, internet security is very important to Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government is highly concerned about computer security issues in Hong Kong. We will continue to follow up on the matter and hope that the US Government will give a full and satisfactory account to the Hong Kong people as soon as possible. Thank you.",
            "Reporter (original question in English): The US Government said it was a deliberate choice by the Hong Kong Government to let Mr Snowden leave Hong Kong because the Government was not honouring the extradition request and the arrest warrant. Was that the case?",
            "Secretary for Justice (original response in English): As I explained earlier, with the chronology which I have given, the answer to your question is \"no\". We have been acting fully in accordance with the law in Hong Kong, particularly the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (Chapter 503) as well as the agreement made between Hong Kong and the United States in 1996. We have been keeping in touch with the US authorities. We notified them through emails initially that we would be studying the case and that we would need further information, and I reiterated the same stance with the US Department of Justice on the 20th of June. Then on the 21st of June, we actually sent them a list of questions which I have outlined earlier, which identified the areas of substantive issues, both in relation to the charges, in relation to the question of whether they can actually satisfy the dual criminality requirement under Hong Kong law, as well as the question of evidential issues, and other questions I outlined earlier, i.e. details which helped to identify exactly which is the person, such as the name and the passport number. So I think I can tell you in no uncertain terms that we have not been deliberately delaying the progress. All along we acted fully in accordance with the law and any suggestion that we have been deliberately letting Mr Snowden go away or to do any other things to obstruct the normal operation is totally untrue.",
            "Reporter: The US Government alleged that the HKSAR Government deliberately let Mr Snowden go away. Do you consider this allegation as totally groundless? What is the HKSAR Government's view on this strong allegation by the US Government?",
            "Secretary for Justice: As I said earlier, we absolutely did not deliberately let Mr Snowden go away. We disagree with this observation completely. As the Chief Executive said earlier, we appreciate how the US feels. Yet, what we, as the Government of the HKSAR, and I, as the Secretary for Justice of Hong Kong, can, and should, do is to act according to the law of Hong Kong. As I explained earlier, we told the US side from the outset that we might need further information for such a complicated case. We did in fact request further information. We did not deliberately drag our feet throughout the matter.",
            "Reporter: Has the Central (Government) been consulted on this case?",
            "Secretary for Justice: We have all along maintained normal communication with the OCMFA in the HKSAR in this respect. However, on the matters relating to the law of Hong Kong I just mentioned decisions were made by the DOJ in accordance with the law of Hong Kong.",
            "Reporter: In handling this matter, the US Government took so long to provide the requested information. Do you consider that the US side as slow? Did Mr Snowden leave Hong Kong in the capacity of a visitor or a refugee? As for the US hacking into Hong Kong computer systems, the US has yet to give a reply. Did the DOJ set a deadline for the reply?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I would rather not comment on the US Government as I do not know why their progress was such in handling the case. They may have their reasons. It is not for me to speculate. Neither do I want to. Mr Snowden left Hong Kong as an ordinary visitor on Sunday morning. Regarding the reports on the hacking into Hong Kong's computer systems by the US, as I have mentioned earlier, Hong Kong is very concerned about the matter. We will work with other relevant departments, especially the Security Bureau, to follow up on it. At this stage, I am not in a position to disclose other details of the actual situation, but I can tell you that we are very concerned about the reports in this respect as the SAR Government places great emphasis on cyber security. Therefore, we will actively follow up on the matter.",
            "Reporter: What has been the communication with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about? Does that affect Hong Kong?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I have mentioned just before that we have communicated with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR on this case. This is a normal communication on our work, as it is undeniable that this case concerns matters of foreign affairs. All normal communication is absolutely normal. It is not only in this case, but in others involving foreign affairs, that other government departments concerned will have such normal communication at work as well. I wish to reiterate that, our communication is fully in compliance with the law of Hong Kong and is in no way in breach of the principle of \"One Country, Two Systems\".",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月二十五日）與傳媒談斯諾登事件的談話全文︰",
            "律政司司長︰各位傳媒朋友，就斯諾登事件，近日律政司這兩天收到很多傳媒查詢。我希望借此機會向大家講幾件事：",
            "第一，美國與香港就逃犯移交的事宜，正如我以前說過，是根據香港法例第503章《逃犯移交條例》及美國與香港於一九九六年十二月簽署的協定所規範。因此，任何由美國就逃犯移交或相關的要求，包括臨時拘捕令的要求，均須依據這條法例及協定規管。",
            "其中一項法律要求，是美國政府提出的刑事指控，必須為協定第2條下描述的刑事罪行，相關涉及的行為亦同時構成香港的罪行，兩個條件其中一個不成立不可以進行引渡，亦有第三方面的考慮，就是移交的要求是不可以涉及政治檢控或因為某人的政治意見而作出的檢控。",
            "在斯諾登事件上，香港律政司有收到美國臨時拘捕令的要求，但無收到正式移交逃犯的要求。",
            "要求發出臨時拘捕令的文件在香港時間六月十五日（星期六）下午收到。文件顯示美國政府向斯諾登提出三項指控。第一項是未獲授權披露國防資料，第二是未獲授權披露情報資料，而第三項是竊取國家財物，即相關資料。律政司國際法律科的同事在收到文件後，隨即研究美國政府向斯諾登提出的刑事指控是否符合法律要求，及審視其他所需的基本資料是否足夠。",
            "在六月十七日（星期一），律政司同事以電郵方式通知美國司法部，香港正草擬一份問題清單，希望澄清相關需要的資料。",
            "在六月十九日，美國司法部要求與我聯絡。因應美國政府的要求，我在六月二十日早上（香港時間）與美國司法部部長進行通話。在簡短的通話過程中，我向美國司法部部長明確提出兩點：",
            "第一點是就美方提出臨時拘捕令的要求，我們會嚴格依照香港的法律和一九九六年香港和美國所簽訂的協議處理；第二，斯諾登這件事的情況複雜，所以律政司的同事需要一點時間處理，但會盡快回覆，並指出預期應該可以在（香港時間）上星期五或之前向美方提交我們要求的資料。",
            "在六月二十一日（星期五）早上（香港時間），特區政府透過保安局致函美國政府，要求就有報道指美國政府機構入侵香港電腦系統作出澄清。同日（六月二十一日）下午，即美國時間星期五早上，律政司以電郵及速遞方式致函美國司法部，要求美國政府就臨時拘捕令的要求提供進一步資料。我們要求的進一步資料包括以下幾方面︰",
            "第一，美國政府向斯諾登提出的刑事指控，特別是第一及第二項，即未獲授權洩露國防資料和情報資料，是他們認為在一九九六年美國與香港所簽訂的協議第2條下，屬於哪一條條款。我剛才已說，他們對斯諾登提出的起訴，一定要在屬第2條下的罪行才可提出移交，所以我們要求澄清他們所依靠的是第2條下的哪一條條款。",
            "第二項我們要求的資料涉及美國政府將會依賴的證據的一些相關法律問題，因為文件中並無清楚交代他們將會用的證據，而當中在香港的法律會衍生一些問題，所以有必要澄清。",
            "第三，都是一些其他基本資料需要澄清，我可以舉兩個例子。例如在我們有的資料和文件中，發現斯諾登的英文名字有出入。在外交文件用的名字是Edward James Snowden，在我們有的入境紀錄中，斯諾登的名稱是Edward Joseph Snowden，所以外交文件用了James這個middle name，入境紀錄中是Joseph這個middle name，而美國司法部提交的美國法院文件只用Edward J. Snowden這名字。這三個名字並非完全一致，故此我們認為有需要澄清，否則，當發出臨時拘捕令時，可能引伸法律問題。",
            "另一方面，我們留意到美國提供的文件提及斯諾登持有美國護照，但文件中沒提及此護照的編號。在確認某人身分時，我們認為護照編號是相關資料。所以除了剛才所說其他法律問題，包括刑事罪行、證據等其他問題外，我們亦要求美國司法部提供這方面的基本資料。",
            "另外，如剛才所說，有報道提及美國政府機構入侵香港電腦系統。就此事，我們於上星期五下午發出的要求提供資料的信件，亦有就這方面向美國司法部提出，因為這方面的情況，將影響我們考慮美國政府對斯諾登提出的指控會否被認定為政治檢控，或因為斯諾登的政治意見而受美國政府的政治檢控。因此我們認為需要求美國政府作出澄清。",
            "眾所周知，斯諾登於上星期日（六月二十三日）早上自行以合法的正常途徑離開香港，直到斯諾登離港那一刻、那一分鐘，美國沒有回覆律政司要求的進一步資料。因此，在香港法律制度下，律政司不可能、亦無法律基礎要求香港法官簽發臨時拘捕令。在沒有臨時拘捕令的簽發下，香港特區政府沒有法律依據限制或禁止斯諾登離開香港。",
            "在整件事的處理上，律政司的態度及採取的標準一直非常清晰。律政司沒有刻意放生斯諾登，更沒有刻意放緩處理美方要求的步伐。相反，如剛才所說，我們一直以香港法律、香港與美國之間的協定及香港的法治精神處理這事。亦如我剛才簡述一樣，一直有與美方相關部門保持聯絡。",
            "直到現在，美國政府仍未回覆上星期五保安局向美國政府致函要求澄清有報道指美國政府機構入侵香港電腦系統的查詢，亦無回覆律政府上星期五的信件，亦有提及入侵香港電腦系統一事。到目前為止，美國政府並無回覆保安局或律政司。",
            "香港作為一個國際金融、經貿及資訊中心，網絡保安十分重要，特區政府非常關注香港電腦的保安問題，我們將繼續跟進事件，亦希望美國政府可盡快向香港市民作全面和令人滿意的交代。多謝大家。",
            "記者︰美國政府指特區政府故意放走斯諾登，你認為這指控是否完全沒有根據？特區政府如何看待美國政府如此強硬的指控？",
            "律政司司長︰正如剛才所說，我們絕對沒有刻意放走斯諾登。我們完全不同意這觀察。我們明白這事情上，如特首日前所說，我們理解美國的感受。但我們作為香港特區政府，我作為香港的律政司司長，我們可以做的、應該做的，是依據香港法律辦事。我剛才已解釋過，我們一開始已告知對方，這事情是複雜的，我們可能需要進一步的資料，而我們亦確實曾要求資料。在整件事中，我們沒有刻意拖慢步伐。",
            "記者︰就今次事件，有沒有問中央（政府）意見？",
            "律政司司長︰在這方面，我們與外交部駐港特派員公署有正常的溝通，但我剛才說的所有有關香港法律的事情，是律政司根據香港法例進行的決定。",
            "記者︰美國政府處理這事時，久久未能提交資料，有否認為美方處理速度緩慢？斯諾登離開香港時，是旅客抑或難民身分？有關美國入侵香港電腦系統，美方至今沒有回應，律政司有沒有要求回應的deadline？",
            "律政司司長︰美方政府的情況，我不宜評論，因為我不知道他們為何會以此進程處理事件，可能有他們的原因，我不方便、亦不希望猜測。斯諾登於星期日早上以正常旅客身分離開香港。就有報道指美國入侵香港電腦系統，剛才我已提及，香港非常關注這問題，我們會配合其他相關部門，特別是保安局跟進此事。現階段不方便透露實際情況的其他詳情，但我可以跟大家說，我們非常關注這方面的報道，因為特區政府非常重網絡安全，所以我們會積極跟進。",
            "記者︰與外交部溝通了甚麼？有沒有影響香港？",
            "律政司司長︰剛才我說過，就這事件，我們有與外交部駐港特派員公署溝通，這是正常的工作溝通，因為這件事無可否認涉及外交成分，所有正常溝通是絕對正常。不單是在今次的事件，其他涉及外交情況，其他相關政府部門亦會有正常工作關係的溝通。我希望強調，我們的溝通絕對符合香港法律，絕對沒有違反「一國兩制」原則。",

            "As an international financial, economic and information centre, internet security is very important to Hong Kong",
            "The HKSAR Government is highly concerned about computer security issues in Hong Kong",
            "We will continue to follow up on the matter and hope that the US Government will give a full and satisfactory account to the Hong Kong people as soon as possible",
            "Thank you.",
            "Reporter (original question in English): The US Government said it was a deliberate choice by the Hong Kong Government to let Mr Snowden leave Hong Kong because the Government was not honouring the extradition request and the arrest warrant",
            "Was that the case?",
            "Secretary for Justice (original response in English): As I explained earlier, with the chronology which I have given, the answer to your question is \"no\"",
            "We have been acting fully in accordance with the law in Hong Kong, particularly the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (Chapter 503) as well as the agreement made between Hong Kong and the United States in 1996",
            "We have been keeping in touch with the US authorities",
            "We notified them through emails initially that we would be studying the case and that we would need further information, and I reiterated the same stance with the US Department of Justice on the 20th of June",
            "Then on the 21st of June, we actually sent them a list of questions which I have outlined earlier, which identified the areas of substantive issues, both in relation to the charges, in relation to the question of whether they can actually satisfy the dual criminality requirement under Hong Kong law, as well as the question of evidential issues, and other questions I outlined earlier, i.e",
            "details which helped to identify exactly which is the person, such as the name and the passport number",
            "So I think I can tell you in no uncertain terms that we have not been deliberately delaying the progress",
            "All along we acted fully in accordance with the law and any suggestion that we have been deliberately letting Mr Snowden go away or to do any other things to obstruct the normal operation is totally untrue.",
            "Reporter: The US Government alleged that the HKSAR Government deliberately let Mr Snowden go away",
            "Do you consider this allegation as totally groundless? What is the HKSAR Government's view on this strong allegation by the US Government?",
            "Secretary for Justice: As I said earlier, we absolutely did not deliberately let Mr Snowden go away",
            "We disagree with this observation completely",
            "As the Chief Executive said earlier, we appreciate how the US feels",
            "Yet, what we, as the Government of the HKSAR, and I, as the Secretary for Justice of Hong Kong, can, and should, do is to act according to the law of Hong Kong",
            "As I explained earlier, we told the US side from the outset that we might need further information for such a complicated case",
            "We did in fact request further information",
            "We did not deliberately drag our feet throughout the matter.",
            "Reporter: Has the Central (Government) been consulted on this case?",
            "Secretary for Justice: We have all along maintained normal communication with the OCMFA in the HKSAR in this respect",
            "However, on the matters relating to the law of Hong Kong I just mentioned decisions were made by the DOJ in accordance with the law of Hong Kong.",
            "Reporter: In handling this matter, the US Government took so long to provide the requested information",
            "Do you consider that the US side as slow? Did Mr Snowden leave Hong Kong in the capacity of a visitor or a refugee? As for the US hacking into Hong Kong computer systems, the US has yet to give a reply",
            "Did the DOJ set a deadline for the reply?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I would rather not comment on the US Government as I do not know why their progress was such in handling the case",
            "They may have their reasons",
            "It is not for me to speculate",
            "Neither do I want to",
            "Mr Snowden left Hong Kong as an ordinary visitor on Sunday morning",
            "Regarding the reports on the hacking into Hong Kong's computer systems by the US, as I have mentioned earlier, Hong Kong is very concerned about the matter",
            "We will work with other relevant departments, especially the Security Bureau, to follow up on it",
            "At this stage, I am not in a position to disclose other details of the actual situation, but I can tell you that we are very concerned about the reports in this respect as the SAR Government places great emphasis on cyber security",
            "Therefore, we will actively follow up on the matter.",
            "Reporter: What has been the communication with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about? Does that affect Hong Kong?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I have mentioned just before that we have communicated with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR on this case",
            "This is a normal communication on our work, as it is undeniable that this case concerns matters of foreign affairs",
            "All normal communication is absolutely normal",
            "It is not only in this case, but in others involving foreign affairs, that other government departments concerned will have such normal communication at work as well",
            "I wish to reiterate that, our communication is fully in compliance with the law of Hong Kong and is in no way in breach of the principle of \"One Country, Two Systems\".",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月二十五日）與傳媒談斯諾登事件的談話全文︰",
            "律政司司長︰各位傳媒朋友，就斯諾登事件，近日律政司這兩天收到很多傳媒查詢",
            "我希望借此機會向大家講幾件事：",
            "第一，美國與香港就逃犯移交的事宜，正如我以前說過，是根據香港法例第503章《逃犯移交條例》及美國與香港於一九九六年十二月簽署的協定所規範",
            "因此，任何由美國就逃犯移交或相關的要求，包括臨時拘捕令的要求，均須依據這條法例及協定規管",
            "其中一項法律要求，是美國政府提出的刑事指控，必須為協定第2條下描述的刑事罪行，相關涉及的行為亦同時構成香港的罪行，兩個條件其中一個不成立不可以進行引渡，亦有第三方面的考慮，就是移交的要求是不可以涉及政治檢控或因為某人的政治意見而作出的檢控",
            "在斯諾登事件上，香港律政司有收到美國臨時拘捕令的要求，但無收到正式移交逃犯的要求",
            "要求發出臨時拘捕令的文件在香港時間六月十五日（星期六）下午收到",
            "文件顯示美國政府向斯諾登提出三項指控",
            "第一項是未獲授權披露國防資料，第二是未獲授權披露情報資料，而第三項是竊取國家財物，即相關資料",
            "律政司國際法律科的同事在收到文件後，隨即研究美國政府向斯諾登提出的刑事指控是否符合法律要求，及審視其他所需的基本資料是否足夠",
            "在六月十七日（星期一），律政司同事以電郵方式通知美國司法部，香港正草擬一份問題清單，希望澄清相關需要的資料",
            "在六月十九日，美國司法部要求與我聯絡",
            "因應美國政府的要求，我在六月二十日早上（香港時間）與美國司法部部長進行通話",
            "在簡短的通話過程中，我向美國司法部部長明確提出兩點：",
            "第一點是就美方提出臨時拘捕令的要求，我們會嚴格依照香港的法律和一九九六年香港和美國所簽訂的協議處理；第二，斯諾登這件事的情況複雜，所以律政司的同事需要一點時間處理，但會盡快回覆，並指出預期應該可以在（香港時間）上星期五或之前向美方提交我們要求的資料",
            "在六月二十一日（星期五）早上（香港時間），特區政府透過保安局致函美國政府，要求就有報道指美國政府機構入侵香港電腦系統作出澄清",
            "同日（六月二十一日）下午，即美國時間星期五早上，律政司以電郵及速遞方式致函美國司法部，要求美國政府就臨時拘捕令的要求提供進一步資料",
            "我們要求的進一步資料包括以下幾方面︰",
            "第一，美國政府向斯諾登提出的刑事指控，特別是第一及第二項，即未獲授權洩露國防資料和情報資料，是他們認為在一九九六年美國與香港所簽訂的協議第2條下，屬於哪一條條款",
            "我剛才已說，他們對斯諾登提出的起訴，一定要在屬第2條下的罪行才可提出移交，所以我們要求澄清他們所依靠的是第2條下的哪一條條款",
            "第二項我們要求的資料涉及美國政府將會依賴的證據的一些相關法律問題，因為文件中並無清楚交代他們將會用的證據，而當中在香港的法律會衍生一些問題，所以有必要澄清",
            "第三，都是一些其他基本資料需要澄清，我可以舉兩個例子",
            "例如在我們有的資料和文件中，發現斯諾登的英文名字有出入",
            "這三個名字並非完全一致，故此我們認為有需要澄清，否則，當發出臨時拘捕令時，可能引伸法律問題",
            "另一方面，我們留意到美國提供的文件提及斯諾登持有美國護照，但文件中沒提及此護照的編號",
            "在確認某人身分時，我們認為護照編號是相關資料",
            "所以除了剛才所說其他法律問題，包括刑事罪行、證據等其他問題外，我們亦要求美國司法部提供這方面的基本資料",
            "另外，如剛才所說，有報道提及美國政府機構入侵香港電腦系統",
            "就此事，我們於上星期五下午發出的要求提供資料的信件，亦有就這方面向美國司法部提出，因為這方面的情況，將影響我們考慮美國政府對斯諾登提出的指控會否被認定為政治檢控，或因為斯諾登的政治意見而受美國政府的政治檢控",
            "因此我們認為需要求美國政府作出澄清",
            "眾所周知，斯諾登於上星期日（六月二十三日）早上自行以合法的正常途徑離開香港，直到斯諾登離港那一刻、那一分鐘，美國沒有回覆律政司要求的進一步資料",
            "因此，在香港法律制度下，律政司不可能、亦無法律基礎要求香港法官簽發臨時拘捕令",
            "在沒有臨時拘捕令的簽發下，香港特區政府沒有法律依據限制或禁止斯諾登離開香港",
            "在整件事的處理上，律政司的態度及採取的標準一直非常清晰",
            "律政司沒有刻意放生斯諾登，更沒有刻意放緩處理美方要求的步伐",
            "相反，如剛才所說，我們一直以香港法律、香港與美國之間的協定及香港的法治精神處理這事",
            "亦如我剛才簡述一樣，一直有與美方相關部門保持聯絡",
            "直到現在，美國政府仍未回覆上星期五保安局向美國政府致函要求澄清有報道指美國政府機構入侵香港電腦系統的查詢，亦無回覆律政府上星期五的信件，亦有提及入侵香港電腦系統一事",
            "到目前為止，美國政府並無回覆保安局或律政司",
            "香港作為一個國際金融、經貿及資訊中心，網絡保安十分重要，特區政府非常關注香港電腦的保安問題，我們將繼續跟進事件，亦希望美國政府可盡快向香港市民作全面和令人滿意的交代",
            "多謝大家",
            "記者︰美國政府指特區政府故意放走斯諾登，你認為這指控是否完全沒有根據？特區政府如何看待美國政府如此強硬的指控？",
            "律政司司長︰正如剛才所說，我們絕對沒有刻意放走斯諾登",
            "我們完全不同意這觀察",
            "我們明白這事情上，如特首日前所說，我們理解美國的感受",
            "但我們作為香港特區政府，我作為香港的律政司司長，我們可以做的、應該做的，是依據香港法律辦事",
            "我剛才已解釋過，我們一開始已告知對方，這事情是複雜的，我們可能需要進一步的資料，而我們亦確實曾要求資料",
            "在整件事中，我們沒有刻意拖慢步伐",
            "記者︰就今次事件，有沒有問中央（政府）意見？",
            "律政司司長︰在這方面，我們與外交部駐港特派員公署有正常的溝通，但我剛才說的所有有關香港法律的事情，是律政司根據香港法例進行的決定",
            "記者︰美國政府處理這事時，久久未能提交資料，有否認為美方處理速度緩慢？斯諾登離開香港時，是旅客抑或難民身分？有關美國入侵香港電腦系統，美方至今沒有回應，律政司有沒有要求回應的deadline？",
            "律政司司長︰美方政府的情況，我不宜評論，因為我不知道他們為何會以此進程處理事件，可能有他們的原因，我不方便、亦不希望猜測",
            "斯諾登於星期日早上以正常旅客身分離開香港",
            "就有報道指美國入侵香港電腦系統，剛才我已提及，香港非常關注這問題，我們會配合其他相關部門，特別是保安局跟進此事",
            "現階段不方便透露實際情況的其他詳情，但我可以跟大家說，我們非常關注這方面的報道，因為特區政府非常重網絡安全，所以我們會積極跟進",
            "記者︰與外交部溝通了甚麼？有沒有影響香港？",
            "律政司司長︰剛才我說過，就這事件，我們有與外交部駐港特派員公署溝通，這是正常的工作溝通，因為這件事無可否認涉及外交成分，所有正常溝通是絕對正常",
            "不單是在今次的事件，其他涉及外交情況，其他相關政府部門亦會有正常工作關係的溝通",
            "我希望強調，我們的溝通絕對符合香港法律，絕對沒有違反「一國兩制」原則",
            "（請同時參閱談話內容的英文部分）",
