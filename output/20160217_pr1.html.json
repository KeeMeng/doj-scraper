            "Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council today (February 17):",
            "Question:",
            "In response to a question on the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (the Chinachem Foundation) which I raised on June 3 last year, the Secretary for Justice (SJ) indicated that since December 10, 2007, the Estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang (the Estate) had, in accordance with a court order, been administered and preserved by independent interim administrators (administrators) appointed by the court until any further court order. SJ pointed out that he, as the protector of charities, would actively follow up on the arrangements for and the details of the implementation of the Will, and would continue the discussion with the Chinachem Foundation on the plans for administering the Estate, upon the detailed consideration by the Department of Justice (DoJ) of the judgment handed down by the Court of Final Appeal in May last year (that is, the Chinachem Foundation is to hold the Estate as a trustee and will not receive the Estate as an absolute gift). SJ also indicated that DoJ had all along been paying attention to the administration of the Estate and keeping contact with the administrators, including vetting the periodical reports provided by the administrators. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) as the accountants from an accounting firm are serving as the aforesaid administrators, whether the Government has assessed if those accountants have the experience necessary for administering the business relating to the Estate, which is worth tens of billions of Hong Kong dollars; if it has, of the details;",
            "(2) of the details of the administrators' work in administering and preserving the aforesaid Estate at present, the monthly fees charged by the administrators, and the expected time when the court will order the termination of the work of the administrators;",
            "(3) whether DoJ has, in the course of keeping contact with the administrators and vetting the relevant periodical reports, uncovered any behaviour damaging the value of the Estate, such as negligence, conspiracy to commit a breach of duties, maladministration, etc; if DoJ has, of the details;",
            "(4) whether the data on the balance and expenditure of the properties for charitable purposes under the Estate will be made public regularly, or disclosed upon public enquiry; if so, of the details of the relevant practices; if not, the reasons for that; and",
            "(5) of the details and progress of DoJ's discussion with the relevant stakeholders on the various tasks relating to the administration of the Estate, including the stakeholders involved, and whether DoJ has sought directions from the court on the relevant tasks; the expected time for DoJ to come up with the proposals for the implementation of and arrangements for the Will?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The question raised by the Hon Paul Tse concerns the status of the management of the estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang (the Estate) as well as the follow-up work by the Department of Justice (DoJ) in respect of the matters relating to the implementation of the Will. As regards parts (1) to (5) of the question, DoJ replies are as follows:",
            "(1), (2) & (3)",
            "Since December 10, 2007, the Estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang has, pursuant to a Court order, been administered and preserved by independent interim administrators appointed by the Court. Professional accountants have all along been acting as the independent interim administrators. The Court has taken into account the relevant experience and professional background of the professional accountants concerned before appointing them as independent interim administrators.",
            "As regards the work of the independent interim administrators, pursuant to the order of the Court, they are authorised to manage the properties and affairs of the Estate. Their principal responsibilities are to get in and preserve the properties of the Estate, including making enquiries as they deem reasonably necessary or taking out legal proceedings when necessary, and requiring any person(s) having custody, control or management of properties of the Estate to deliver or transfer to the interim administrators such properties so as to ensure that the Estate is properly preserved. Besides, the relevant work also includes handling matters arising from the operation of the Chinachem Group.",
            "The judgment of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) delivered on May 18, 2015 does not affect the current independent interim administrators' discharge of the abovementioned duties to manage and preserve the Estate pursuant to the Court's appointment until any further Court order. As the work in implementing the Will is still ongoing, it cannot be anticipated at this stage when the work relating to interim administration will come to an end.",
            "By keeping contact and by considering materials provided by the interim administrators (including periodical reports), DoJ has all along been paying close attention to the work of administering and preserving the Estate, including how the interim administrators have followed up irregularities which concern the Chinachem Group and the Estate, and the latest development of legal proceedings already instituted. As the relevant follow-up work and proceedings are still ongoing, save for information already available in the public domain, it is inappropriate for DoJ to make any further comment at this stage. Further, the work of the interim administrators will continue to be monitored by the Court, including the consideration of the periodical reports and other materials provided by them.",
            "The fees of the independent interim administrators have been provided for in the appointment order of the Court. In the absence of any order of the Court directing disclosure, it is inappropriate for DoJ to disclose the relevant information to the public.",
            "(4) & (5)",
            "By its judgment of May 18, 2015 concerning the Will of the late Mrs Nina Wang, the CFA held that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (the Foundation) is to hold the Estate as a trustee rather than receiving it as an unconditional absolute gift. The judgment has clarified the proper interpretation of the Will and provides a clear legal basis and guidance for the future relevant work concerning the implementation of the Will.",
            "In accordance with the said judgment, DoJ is now actively liaising with the Foundation in relation to the implementation of the Will and will seek the Court's direction as and when necessary so as to eventually submit a scheme on using the Estate for charitable purposes to the Court for approval. DoJ aims to complete the draft of the scheme by around the middle of this year and to seek the Court's direction at an appropriate time. Before that, the Estate will continue to be administered by the Court appointed independent interim administrators, whose work will continue to be monitored by DoJ and the Court.",
            "As the details for the scheme are still being discussed, it remains undecided at the stage as to how the relevant expenditure and the balance of the Estate for charitable purposes are to be disclosed in future to the extent permitted or required by law.",

            "至於獨立臨時遺產管理人的工作，按照法庭的命令，臨時遺產管理人獲授權管理該筆遺產中的財產及相關事務，其主要職責是查明和保護該筆遺產內的財產，包括作出合理及必要的查詢或在有需要時開展恰當法律程序，以及要求任何保管、控制及管理屬於該筆遺產的財產的人士交出及轉移有關財產予臨時遺產管理人，以確保該筆遺產得以妥善保存。此外，有關工作亦包括處理華懋集團營運上的相關事宜。",
            "終審法院在二○一五年五月十八日作出的判決，並不影響現任獨立臨時遺產管理人在現階段繼續按法庭的委任履行上述妥善管理和保存該筆遺產的職責，直至法庭另有頒發命令為止。由於落實執行遺囑的工作仍在進行中，現時未能預計臨時遺產管理工作何時終結。",
            "律政司一直與臨時遺產管理人保持聯絡，並透過審閱臨時遺產管理人提交的資料（包括定期報告），密切關注該筆遺產的管理和保存的工作，包括臨時遺產管理人如何跟進牽涉華懋集團和該筆遺產的任何懷疑不當行為以及經已提出法律訴訟的個案的最新發展。由於有關跟進工作和訴訟程序仍在進行中，除公開的資料外，律政司不適宜在現階段作出進一步的評論。此外，臨時遺產管理人的工作亦一直受法庭監管，包括審閱其定期提交的報告和其他相關資料。",
            "有關獨立臨時遺產管理人收取的費用，在法庭的委任命令有所規定。在法庭沒有頒令披露的情況下，律政司不適宜將有關資料公開。",

            "根據有關判決，律政司正積極與華懋慈善基金就有關遺囑的落實進行磋商，在有需要時會向法庭尋求指示，並最終按照終審法院的指示提交有關如何運用該筆遺產作慈善用途的管理計劃給法庭批核。律政司期望可於大約今年年中完成制定管理計劃的建議，並在適當時間向法庭尋求指示。在此之前，該筆遺產將繼續由法庭委任的獨立臨時遺產管理人進行管理，而律政司和法庭亦會繼續監察其工作。",
