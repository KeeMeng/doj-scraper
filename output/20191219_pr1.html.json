            "The Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice today (December 19) released its annual report, \"Prosecutions Hong Kong 2018\", which reviews the Division's work and important cases of last year.",
            "In his letter presenting the report to the Secretary for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr David Leung, SC, described the year 2018 as \"an eventful year for the Division\". He said, \"Throughout the year, prosecutors in the Division upheld their role as 'ministers of justice' in pursuance of fair and independent prosecution.\"",
            "In the Director's Overview, Mr Leung reiterated that he was saddened by the accusation of \"political prosecution\". He emphasised that \"we do not seek to secure a conviction at all costs. Our role is to ensure that every defendant receives a fair trial ... We prosecute in the name of the public for the good of Hong Kong. We shall do so even though it is an increasingly thankless task. We shall do so amidst tides of criticisms and abuses. We shall brave the storm, together as a Division; and with dignity, fulfil our duty to uphold justice. We strive to do our best to maintain a high quality prosecution service.\"",
            "On assumption of his office on December 29, 2017, Mr Leung determined to make it a goal for prosecutors in the Division to gain more exposure in court work and to enhance their advocacy skills. To pursue this goal in 2018, more junior prosecutors were assigned to prosecute trials and appeals together with more experienced prosecutors. As stated in the annual report, the Division also continued to conduct seminars and sharing sessions covering topical issues frequently to keep prosecutors abreast of the latest developments in procedural and substantive law, and arranged different local and overseas training courses to hone prosecutors' knowledge and skills necessary for a more efficient discharge of their duties.",

            "梁卓然在年報的序言中，重申他對「政治檢控」的指控感到難受。他強調：「我們不會不惜一切代價令被告入罪，我們的職責是確保所有被告都得到公平審訊……我們為了香港的福祉，代表公眾作出檢控。即使工作日益不討好，即使面對種種批評和重重責難，我們定必戮力同心緊守崗位，迎難而上，並莊敬自強，以秉持公義為己任，致力維持優質的檢控服務。」",
