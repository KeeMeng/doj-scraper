            "In response to protesters' request for the DoJ not to initiate prosecutions for cases under investigation, a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) today (June 27) pointed out that all investigations are conducted by law enforcement agencies which will after investigation and when necessary refer to the DoJ for independent decisions on whether to prosecute.",
            "The DoJ makes each prosecutorial decision based on evidence, the applicable laws and the Prosecution Code. Unless there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction, no prosecution should be commenced. If there is sufficient evidence to initiate a prosecution, the DoJ will then consider whether it is in the public interest to do so, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, the attitude and psychological conditions of the suspect, etc.",
            "Irrespective of how an incident is defined by any person, it would not affect the DoJ in discharging its prosecutorial duties impartially in accordance with Article 63 of the Basic Law.",
            "The spokesman stressed that the Government has put a stop to the legislative exercise relating to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance. The current term of the Legislative Council will end in July next year, after which the Bill will lapse. The Government accepts this reality.",
            "The spokesman appealed to protesters to act peacefully and rationally when expressing their opinions and take into account the needs of other members of the public.",

            "律政司發言人今日（六月二十七日）表示，對於有示威人士要求律政司就尚未完成調查案件不提出檢控，發言人指出，所有案件的調查工作由執法機關負責。調查完畢後，執法機關有需要時才會交予律政司獨立決定是否提出檢控。",
            "就每宗案件的刑事檢控決定，律政司必須按證據、適用法律和《檢控守則》作出。除非有充分可被法庭接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪，否則律政司不會提出檢控。如有充分證據進行檢控，律政司會繼而考慮作出檢控是否符合公眾利益，包括罪行的性質、嚴重程度及疑犯的態度或心理狀況等。",
