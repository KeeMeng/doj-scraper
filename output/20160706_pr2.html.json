            "Following is a question by the Hon Alvin Yeung and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council today (July 6):",
            "Question:",
            "The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) made an order on the W case in July 2013, holding that a person in a situation same as that of Ms W, the applicant, (i.e. male by birth, but changed to female after undergoing full sex reassignment surgery (SRS)) was qualified as a \"woman\" under the relevant legislation and was therefore entitled to marry a man. CFA decided at the same time to suspend the order for 12 months to allow the Government and this Council sufficient time for discussion and carrying out work to amend legislation. Subsequently, the Government introduced the Marriage (Amendment) Bill 2014 into this Council on March 19, 2014, but the bill was negatived by this Council. On the other hand, the Government set up an Inter-departmental Working Group on Gender Recognition (IWG) in January 2014 to consider legislation and administrative measures that were required to protect the rights of transsexuals in all legal contexts, and to make reform recommendations. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the work progress of IWG;",
            "(2) of the legislation and administrative measures being studied by IWG;",
            "(3) whether IWG has finalised the drafting of reform recommendations; if IWG has, of the details;",
            "(4) as one of the tasks of IWG is to study other jurisdictions' legislation, case-law and systems concerning gender recognition, of the details and progress of the task;",
            "(5) as CFA mentioned in the W case the gender recognition problems faced by transsexuals (including those who had not fully completed SRS) and hoped that the executive authorities and the legislature would consider how to deal with those problems, whether the authorities have conducted studies in this regard; if they have, of the details, including the legislation and administrative measures that have been/are being studied; if not, the reasons for that; and",
            "(6) when the authorities will introduce a bill to amend the Marriage Ordinance (Cap 181) into this Council again?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The consolidated reply to Hon Alvin Yeung's question is as follows:",
            "The Government set up the Inter-departmental Working Group on Gender Recognition (IWG) to consider legislative and incidental administrative measures that may be required to protect the rights of transsexual persons in the legal contexts and to make such recommendations for reform as may be appropriate.",
            "The scope of the IWG's study includes both recognition and post-recognition issues. The IWG is currently studying recognition issues and, upon completion of this study, will move to the next stage of study concerning post-recognition issues.",
            "On recognition issues, the IWG has been reviewing various issues, including the condition known as gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria, whether there should be a gender recognition scheme, the various options for a gender recognition scheme, and the relevant qualification criteria (including the extent to which sex reassignment surgery (SRS) is required) and the application procedure. In this connection, the IWG has been conducting a review of the legislation, schemes and case law in over 100 overseas jurisdictions, and the standards of international bodies, with a view to making recommendations to the Government on possible legislation that may be necessary to address the issues faced by transsexual persons. The IWG is currently in the course of drafting a consultation paper to seek the views of the public on recognition issues. It will endeavour to publish the paper as early as possible within this year.",
            "As regards post-recognition issues, the IWG will focus on reviewing all the existing legislative provisions and administrative measures in Hong Kong which may be affected by legal gender recognition, so that any required legislative or procedural reform may be followed up by the Government.",
            "The IWG will continue to consult widely in the course of its work before finalising its recommendations to the Government. Upon receipt of the final recommendations of the IWG, the Government will consider them carefully before determining the way forward for the relevant reform. At this moment, since public consultation is yet to be done, it is not possible at this stage to set any time table for introducing legislation to implement the proposals to be put forward by the IWG. For the same reason, it is premature to comment on whether, and if so, when the Government will introduce a bill to amend the Marriage Ordinance (Cap 181) into the Legislative Council.",

            "以下是今日（七月六日）在立法會會議上楊岳橋議員的提問和律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的書面答覆︰",
            "問題：",
            "終審法院於二○一三年七月在W案中作出命令，與申訴人W小姐同一處境的人士（即出生時為男性，但已接受整項性別重置手術由男性變為女性），符合相關法例中「女性」的定義，因此有權與一名男性結婚。終審法院同時決定暫緩執行該命令十二個月，以讓政府及本會有足夠時間討論及進行修改法例工作。政府其後在二○一四年三月十九日向本會提交《2014年婚姻（修訂）條例草案》，但該條例草案被本會否決。另一方面，政府在二○一四年一月成立了性別承認跨部門工作小組（工作小組），研究全面保障變性人的法律權利所需的法例和行政措施，並提出改革建議。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）工作小組的工作進展為何；",
            "（二）工作小組正研究哪些法例和行政措施；",
            "（三）工作小組是否已完成草擬改革建議；如是，詳情為何；",
            "（四）鑑於工作小組的其中一項工作是研究其他司法管轄區有關性別承認的法例、判例和制度，該項工作的詳情和進展為何；",
            "（五）鑑於終審法院在W案中提及變性人（包括未完成重置手術的人士）面對性別承認的問題，並希望行政和立法機關考慮如何處理該等問題，當局有否就此進行研究；如有，詳情為何，包括曾經／現正就哪些法例和行政措施進行研究；如否，原因為何；及",
            "（六）當局何時會再次向本會提交修訂《婚姻條例》（第181章）的條例草案？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "就楊岳橋議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：",
            "政府成立性別承認跨部門工作小組（工作小組），研究全面保障變性人士的法律權利所須的法例和相關行政措施，並作出合適的改革建議。",
            "工作小組的研究範圍包括性別承認及性別承認後的議題。工作小組現正研究性別承認的問題，完成後會進入下一個研究階段，即性別承認後的議題。",
            "在性別承認問題方面，工作小組正審視多個議題，包括稱為性別認同障礙或性別不安的症狀、應否設立一套性別承認制度、性別承認制度的不同方案，以及相關的資格準則（包括對接受性別重置手術的程度的要求）和申請程序。就此，工作小組正檢視超過一百個司法管轄區的法例、制度和案例，以及國際組織的準則，以期就處理變性人士所面對的問題而可能需要訂立的法例，向政府提出建議。工作小組現正擬備諮詢文件，以徵詢公眾對性別承認問題的意見，並會致力在本年內盡早發出該份文件。",
            "至於性別承認後的問題，工作小組會集中檢討香港所有可能受法律性別承認影響的現行法例條文及行政措施，讓政府可跟進所需的法例或程序改革。",
            "向政府提出最終建議前，工作小組會繼續在需要時就相關問題進行廣泛諮詢。收到工作小組的最終建議後，政府會仔細考慮，以制定相關改革的未來路向。由於仍未進行公眾諮詢，現階段不可能就落實工作小組建議訂立立法時間表。同樣道理，政府目前未能評論是否會及（如會的話）何時會再向立法會提交修訂《婚姻條例》（第181章）的條例草案。",
