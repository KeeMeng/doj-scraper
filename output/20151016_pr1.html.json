            "Following is the transcript of remarks made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, on cases involving Tsang Kin-chiu and seven police officers at a media session today (October 16):",
            "Reporter: Secretary, there're concerns that if the case for Ken Tsang is handled in the Eastern court and he is prosecuted before the case involving the seven police officers has concluded in District Court, it may affect the ruling at District Court. Can you ensure fairness for both sides? And secondly, Ken Tsang's lawyer, Michael Vidler, he accused the Department of Justice of trying to blacken Ken Tsang's name and to protect the Police Force by prosecuting them at the same time. Could you comment on it? And could you assure the public that you are actually taking these two cases very seriously?",
            "Secretary for Justice: First of all, we take every case seriously, of course, including this case. We of course appreciate that the Hong Kong community is very concerned with this case and indeed any other criminal cases. Whether a case is big or small, we handle it with the same attitude, namely, we take each and every case seriously.",
            "Maybe I take the second part of your question first. Any suggestion that the prosecution of Mr Tsang is to blacken his character or his reputation is absolutely groundless. We act on the evidence. Of course, because prosecution has already commenced therefore it is not appropriate for me to go into the details. But I think the statement that we issued last night already disclosed the details or the basic facts which we rely on to support the charges made against Mr Tsang, including the throwing of liquid from the bottle that he was holding. That was the basis or, in short, the summary of the factual basis we rely on in support of the prosecution against Mr Tsang. Perhaps we can do this exercise, let's look at the whole series of events from the conduct of Mr Tsang up to the matter that he was said to have been assaulted by the seven police officers and then taken to the police station. If we were to truncate each and every part into, say, an episode, and stop there, one asks the question: is there sufficient evidence that merits the prosecution of Mr Tsang? By applying the standard and threshold laid down in the Prosecution Evidence (Code), namely, the first question, is there evidence to support or warrant a criminal charge? Our conclusion is, yes. Second question, is it in the public interest to commence prosecution? Again, having taken advice, having considered the matter very carefully, we answer this question also in the affirmative. And that's the reason why it was at the end of the day decided that criminal prosecution should be commenced against Mr Tsang.",
            "And of course we applied that same test, the same threshold, to the evidence concerning the seven police officers. And that is the reason why, having considered the evidence, having considered the question of public interest, why we also eventually decided to prosecute the seven police officers. And then the question of course arises as was inherent in your question, as well as in the question posed by other friends of the media as well as covered by some of the comments in the media, the question is how to handle the prosecution of Mr Tsang as well as the prosecution of the seven police officers. And that is in fact one of the issues that we have given much thought to it and that is one of the questions that we consulted a local Senior Counsel as well as overseas Queen's Counsel. With their advice, we concluded that it is appropriate to have them charged on the same day and to have them arranged to go before the court also on the same day, and also the same court.",
            "The intention is, as I said yesterday, to ensure procedural fairness so that if Mr Tsang, or his legal representatives, or if the seven police officers, or their legal representatives, have any submissions or comments to make on the case management of either Mr Tsang's case or the case concerning the seven police officers, including which case should go first, or any other matters concerning the handling of those two cases, the legal representatives would have the opportunity to say whatever they want to say to the judge in charge of the matter.",
            "And as to the final decision, it would not be for the Department of Justice to decide. It would be for the judge, having seized of the matter, to decide which way, or how to handle the two cases, would be most appropriate and therefore, by so doing, can also ensure fairness to all the parties involved. And by so doing, one point, perhaps if I may reiterate, is that by adopting this approach, we are trying to ensure fairness and also, at the end of the day, how those two cases will be handled would not be up to what the Department of Justice says, it would be up to the judge to decide. And that is the reason why we handle it in the way that we have.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（十月十六日）就涉及曾健超及七名警員的案件，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "律政司司長：各位傳媒界朋友，我留意到今日或昨日也有一些報道或討論，指為何曾健超先生和該七名警員同日被起訴和將被安排下星期一到同一個法庭。我想在此盡量再澄清多一次，說清楚多一次，正如我昨日所講，我們的做法是徵詢了香港的獨立資深大律師和海外的御用大律師的意見後作出的決定，目的是希望雙方均有公平的對待，特別是我們昨晚的聲明也有提及，雙方若認為有需要，可以在星期一向法官提出就兩件刑事檢控往後的審訊有任何意見，包括其安排、先後次序或其他相關事宜，可以向法官提出他們認為合適的陳詞，最終兩個案件怎麼處理，哪個先，哪個後，以及其他的事情可以由法庭去處理。這樣對雙方，無論對曾先生也好，七警也好，也是最公平的，沒有如某些報道所說的政治考慮，亦沒有混淆視聽，亦沒有希望製造甚麼混亂令社會人士覺得七警的罪行可以淡化，絕對沒有這些考慮。我重申這是法律、司法程序上的考慮，亦經過徵詢外間獨立大律師的意見後作出的決定。",
            "記者：司長，有意見指如果曾健超案先審，然後又或被判罪成，接下來他的證供可能受影響，變得不可信，這情況下會否造成不公？第二條問題是律政司希望更換薛偉成主審法官，可否解釋原因？他亦有提到如果一些法官有參與性罪行法律改革，之後是否不可再處理性罪行案件？你有何回應？",
            "律政司司長：就你第一個問題，究竟現時曾先生的檢控會先處理，還是涉及七警的檢控會先處理，現時未有一個定論。所以剛才這位傳媒朋友指若曾先生的case（案件）先處理會否有不公平的情況出現，這到現時為止，正如我剛才所說，也是未知之數。未知之數的原因，是未知究竟是曾先生的檢控會先處理，還是七警那個先處理。",
            "我相信當法庭決定先處理無論是曾先生的檢控或七警的檢控，我相信無論曾先生也好，七警也好，他們的法律代表一定會有充分的機會向法官作出他們的陳詞，他們亦可以向法官建議應該哪一個檢控先處理。若法官決定哪個檢控先處理，亦相信雙方面的律師代表可以向法官陳詞，就是說如何可以盡量確保（沒有）對任何一個被告不公平的地方。所以剛才這位傳媒朋友的問題，最後是兩大點，第一，他們會有機會向法官作出他們認為合適的陳詞；第二，法官會處理這個問題，當然法官處理這個問題時，必然會平衡雙方面公平處理的考慮。",
            "記者：立法會議員葉國謙說事發後一周年才檢控是有政治考慮，你有何看法？",
            "律政司司長：其實我昨天已說過沒有政治考慮。政治考慮永遠不會在我們作檢控決定時被加入我們考慮之列。每一個不同的案件也有其不同的特別之處，我們處理時亦會因為不同的原因，需要一定時間。就今次七警和曾健超先生的情況，其原因我以前已說過，今日不重複，因不同的原因導致我們需要時間去處理。謝謝大家。",
