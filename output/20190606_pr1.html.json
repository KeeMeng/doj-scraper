            "In response to the procession by certain members of the legal sector today (June 6), a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) issued the following statement:",
            "The Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 aims to deal with the Taiwan murder case and seeks to plug the loopholes in the current regime for legal co-operation in criminal matters.",
            "The surrender of fugitive offenders and mutual legal assistance regimes in Hong Kong are devised with reference to the guidelines and model treaties endorsed by the United Nations, and are consistent with human rights protection principles that are commonly followed by the international community. For special surrender arrangements prescribed under the Bill, there can be more safeguards for the protection of the rights of the subject, apart from those provided for by the existing Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (FOO).",
            "The Government has been adopting extremely stringent procedures in handling requests for surrender of fugitive offenders. The existing legislation sets out the appropriate human rights and procedural safeguards, as well as the gatekeeping roles of the court and the executive authorities. Executive scrutiny includes the DoJ's examination on whether the surrender request satisfies the legal requirements and the Chief Executive's decision taking into account the DoJ's advice. The judicial process includes open court hearings and application for judicial review (Note 1), habeas corpus (Note 2) or both by the person involved.",
            "The FOO has been operating effectively for over almost 22 years since its enactment, striking a balance between pursuit of fugitives and protection of human rights.",
            "The independence of the Judiciary is constitutionally provided for and enshrined in Article 85 of the Basic Law. At the same time, the tenure of office of judges is protected by Article 89 of the Basic Law.",
            "More importantly, the independence of judges is also reflected in the Judicial Oath, which is a solemn undertaking by every judge to serve the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and administer justice \"without fear or favour, self-interest or deceit\". The DoJ firmly believes that the Judiciary and all its judicial officers will continue to exercise judicial power in a fair and just manner, and free from any interference.",
            "Note 1: The Chief Executive's issue of authority to proceed or surrender order is susceptible to judicial review, see Robert Henry Cosby v Chief Executive of the HKSAR [1999] HKEC 691, Cheng Chui Ping v the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the United States of America [2002] HKCU 5.",
            "Note 2: HO Man Kong v Superintendent of Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre [2011] HKEC 1037 is a case on habeas corpus.",

            "就部分法律界人士今日（六月六日）遊行，律政司發言人發出以下聲明：",
            "《2019年逃犯及刑事事宜相互法律協助法例（修訂）條例草案》（條例草案）的目的，是處理台灣殺人案，同時堵塞現行刑事司法互助制度的漏洞。",
            "香港的移交逃犯和刑事司法互助機制參照了聯合國在這方面的合作指引和條約範本，並且符合國際通行的人權保障原則。按照《條例草案》訂定的特別移交安排，在保障涉案人方面只會比現行《逃犯條例》規定的更多，而不會減少。",
            "政府在處理移交逃犯請求時一直根據極為嚴謹的程序，現行條例訂明了適當的人權和程序保障，以及行政和司法的多重把關角色。行政審查包括由律政司審視請求是否符合有關法律規定和行政長官考慮律政司意見後的決定；而司法審查包括法院公開聆訊、涉案人可就行政長官的決定申請司法覆核（註一），也可就法院的拘押命令申請人身保護令（註二）。",
            "《逃犯條例》生效至今差不多二十二年，一直行之有效，平衡了緝捕逃犯及保障人權兩方面的需要。",
            "《基本法》第八十五條在憲制層面規定了司法獨立的原則；同時，法官的任期亦受到《基本法》第八十九條保障。",
            "更重要的是，法官的獨立性也反映於莊嚴的司法誓言當中，每一位法官作出司法誓言時均會承諾以「無懼、無偏、無私、無欺」之精神為香港特別行政區服務，並主持正義。律政司深信司法機構和全體司法人員必定會繼續公平、公正地依法審理案件，不受任何干預。",
