            "The following is issued on behalf of the Law Reform Commission:",
            "The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC) published a report on the Review of Substantive Sexual Offences today (December 5), making final recommendations for the reform of substantive sexual offences in the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200). These recommendations include the creation of a range of non-consensual sexual offences such as a new offence of sexual penetration without consent, a uniform age of consent of 16 years old in Hong Kong, the creation of a range of new sexual offences involving children and persons with mental impairment (PMIs) which are gender neutral, and the reform of a series of miscellaneous sexual offences such as incest, exposure, bestiality, necrophilia and homosexual-related buggery and gross indecency offences.",
            "The report follows a study on the overall review of substantive sexual offences by the LRC's Review of Sexual Offences Sub-committee, chaired by Mr Peter Duncan, SC, which issued three consultation papers in September 2012, November 2016 and May 2018. In April 2019, the LRC expeditiously published a report recommending the introduction of a new offence of voyeurism and a new offence in respect of non-consensual upskirt photography. The responses to the consultation papers have been taken into account in formulating the final recommendations in the two reports published in April and December.",
            "Some of the main final recommendations contained in the report are:",
            "(1) Discarding the term \"rape\" to name the offence \"sexual penetration without consent\", and the offence should cover penetration of the vagina or anus, and penile penetration of the mouth of another person;",
            "(2) Abolition of the offence of \"non-consensual buggery\", so that the conduct which is the subject of such an offence would be covered in future by the gender-neutral offence of sexual penetration without consent;",
            "(3) Substituting the offence of \"indecent assault\" with a new offence of \"sexual assault\" focusing on conduct which is \"sexual\" rather than \"indecent\", with a proposed definition of \"sexual\". It is considered that this would best accord with the principle of respecting one's sexual autonomy;",
            "(4) There should be a uniform age of consent in Hong Kong of 16 years of age, which should be applicable irrespective of gender and sexual orientation;",
            "(5) Offences involving children and young persons should be gender-neutral with two separate types of offences, one involving children under 13 and the other involving children under 16, and capable of being committed by either an adult or a child;",
            "(6) Consensual sexual activity between persons who are aged between 13 and 16 should continue to be criminalised while recognising the existence of prosecutorial discretion;",
            "(7) The creation of a new offence of sexual grooming to protect children against paedophiles who might groom them by communicating with them on a mobile phone or on the Internet to gain their trust and confidence with the intention of sexually abusing them;",
            "(8) The proposed new offences involving PMIs should apply to a mentally disordered person or mentally handicapped person (as defined in the Mental Health Ordinance (Cap 136)) whose mental disorder or mental handicap, as the case may be, is of a nature or degree that the person is incapable of guarding himself or herself against sexual exploitation;",
            "(9) The offence of incest should be reformed to become gender-neutral; to cover all penile penetration of the mouth, vagina and anus and other forms of penetration; and be extended to cover uncles (aunts) and nieces (nephews) who are blood relatives as well as adoptive parents;",
            "(10) The proposed creation of a new offence of sexual exposure to cover exposure of one's genitals in private or public in a sexual manner targeting a specific victim;",
            "(11) Replacing the existing offence of bestiality with an offence of sexual intercourse with an animal;",
            "(12) The creation of a new offence of sexual activity on a dead person; and",
            "(13) The abolition of a number of the existing homosexual-related offences.",
            "Copies of the report are available on request from the Secretariat of the LRC at 4/F, East Wing, Justice Place, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central, Hong Kong. The report can also be accessed on the website of the LRC at",

            "香港法律改革委員會（法改會）今日（十二月五日）發表《檢討實質的性罪行》報告書，就改革《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）中實質的性罪行提出最終建議。這些建議包括訂立一系列未經同意下進行的性罪行，如新訂一項關於未經同意下以插入方式進行的性侵犯的罪行、在香港同意性行為的年齡應劃一為16歲、新訂一系列涉及兒童及精神缺損人士的無分性別的性罪行，以及改革一系列雜項性罪行，如亂倫、露體、獸交、戀屍行為，以及關乎同性的肛交及嚴重猥褻作為的罪行。",
            "這份報告書是繼法改會轄下性罪行檢討小組委員會就實質的性罪行進行全面檢討研究後撰寫的。小組委員會由鄧樂勤資深大律師擔任主席，曾就此課題於二○一二年九月、二○一六年十一月及二○一八年五月發表三份諮詢文件。法改會已於二○一九年四月特別迅速地發表一份報告書，建議新訂一項窺淫罪，以及新訂一項未經同意下拍攝裙底罪。在訂定兩份於四月和十二月發表的報告書中的最終建議時，諮詢文件的回應意見已予考慮。",
            "報告書的部分主要最終建議如下：",
            "（1）摒棄「強姦」一詞，並建議一項未經同意下以插入方式進行的性侵犯的罪行，而這項罪行應包括插入陰道或肛門，以及以陽具插入另一人的口腔；",
            "（2）廢除「未經同意下作出肛交」的罪行，現受此項罪行規管的行為日後會由無分性別的未經同意下以插入方式進行的性侵犯罪處理；",
            "（3）以新的「性侵犯」罪取代「猥褻侵犯」罪，把焦點置於「涉及性」而非屬於「猥褻」的行為，並建議為「性」此字設下定義。這樣做會最符合尊重個人性自主權的原則；",
            "（4）在香港同意性行為的年齡應劃一為16歲，並應不論性別和性傾向而適用；",
            "（5）涉及兒童及少年人的罪行應無分性別，並應分為兩類罪行，其中一類涉及13歲以下兒童，另一類則涉及16歲以下兒童，這些罪行可由成年人或兒童干犯；",
            "（6）年滿13歲但未滿16歲的人之間經同意下進行的涉及性的行為應繼續訂為刑事罪行，但認同控方有檢控酌情權；",
            "（7）新訂一項為性目的誘識兒童的罪行以保護兒童，防止戀童癖者藉流動電話或互聯網與兒童通訊來進行誘識，以取得他們的信任和信心，意圖對他們作出性侵犯；",
            "（8）建議新訂涉及精神缺損人士的罪行，應適用於精神紊亂的人或弱智人士（如《精神健康條例》（第136章）所界定者），而其精神紊亂或弱智（視屬何情況而定）的性質或程度令他或她沒有能力保護自己免受性剝削；",
            "（9）亂倫罪應予以改革，使該罪行：無分性別；涵蓋所有以陽具插入口腔、陰道及肛門的行為，以及涵蓋其他形式的插入行為；並擴大範圍至涵蓋屬血親的伯父（伯母）、叔父（叔母）、舅父（舅母）、姑丈（姑母）、姨丈（姨母）及姪女（姪）、甥女（甥），以及涵蓋領養父母；",
            "（10）建議新訂一項性露體罪，涵蓋以特定受害人為目標，而以涉及性的形式在私人或公眾地方暴露生殖器官的行為；",
            "（11）現有的獸交罪應由與動物性交罪所取代；",
            "（12）新訂一項對死人進行涉及性的行為罪；及",
