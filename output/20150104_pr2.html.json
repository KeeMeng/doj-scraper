            "Following is the translation of the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC at the Signing Ceremony of the Host Country Agreement and the related Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements on the Conduct of Dispute Settlement Proceedings by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China today (January 4):",
            "Vice Minister Liu, Secretary-General Mr Siblesz, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,",
            "Good afternoon! First of all, I would like to extend our warmest welcome to all of you for attending this meaningful signing ceremony. I am very glad to see the presence of so many distinguished guests. Your presence at this ceremony to witness the signing of the Host Country Agreement and the related Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements, notwithstanding your hectic schedule, demonstrates their significance. Indeed, these two documents will facilitate the conduct of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)-administered proceedings in the HKSAR, as well as secure the provision of the requisite supporting services.",
            "Permanent Court of Arbitration",
            "In the past 120 years or so, PCA has been facilitating arbitration and other forms of dispute resolution amongst States. PCA has developed into a modern and multi-faceted arbitral institution that is able to meet the rapidly evolving dispute resolution needs of the international community, whether in respect of cases involving public international law or private international law. As of now, not only does PCA provide dispute resolution services involving states, its services cover disputes involving inter-governmental organisations as well as private parties.",
            "In the context of disputes between investors and states, we have seen an increasing number of such cases involving Asian parties in the past few years. The demand for arbitration services for such type of disputes in the region has accordingly increased. PCA currently has 96 pending cases and a substantial number of such cases involve one or several parties from Asia. In light of this trend, PCA does not confine the provision of its services at its headquarters in The Hague, but makes its dispute resolution services more widely accessible in Asia through the conclusion of more agreements with its member states in Asia.",
            "With its central location in Asia, its robust legal system and its wealth of experience in arbitration, the HKSAR is a natural base for PCA to enhance access to its services in Asia. In fact, PCA has conducted the first hearing in the HKSAR in respect of an arbitration dispute between a foreign investor and an Asian State last year. The entire process was completed smoothly and successfully.",
            "HKSAR as an international and regional arbitration centre",
            "The HKSAR Government accords top priority to its policy of consolidating the HKSAR's status as a hub for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia Pacific region. Under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy, the HKSAR continues to apply common law; not only does the HKSAR enjoy judicial independence, it accords utmost importance to the rule of law, and hence is an ideal venue for conducting international arbitration.",
            "The HKSAR currently has over 9 000 locally qualified lawyers (including solicitors and barristers) and over 1 300 registered foreign lawyers from 28 different jurisdictions. Besides, there is no restriction on foreign law firms engaging in international arbitration in the HKSAR.",
            "Further, the HKSAR has been enhancing its legal infrastructures for alternative dispute resolution including arbitration and mediation. The current Arbitration Ordinance, which was enacted in 2010, was primarily based on the latest version of the UNCITRAL Model Law, so as to make our arbitration law more user-friendly to the international business community. Besides, arbitral awards made in the HKSAR can be enforced in 150 jurisdictions pursuant to the New York Convention. The HKSAR also provides an ideal neutral forum to facilitate resolution of disputes involving investments in the Mainland, and arrangements have been concluded with the Mainland on reciprocal enforcement of arbitration awards so as to ensure that arbitration awards rendered in the HKSAR may be effectively enforced in the Mainland.",
            "Several renowned international legal bodies have established their presence in the HKSAR in recent years. In 2008, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce established its branch secretariat in the HKSAR, which is the very first one outside its Paris headquarters. In 2012, the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) set up in the HKSAR its first branch outside Mainland China; at around the same time, The Hague Conference on Private International Law opened its Asia Pacific Regional Office in the HKSAR. Late last year, the China Maritime Arbitration Commission (CMAC) Hong Kong Arbitration Center was established in the HKSAR, which is also the first CMAC centre established outside Mainland China.",
            "With the Host Country Agreement and the related Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements, I am confident that the status of the HKSAR as an international arbitration centre in the Asia Pacific region will be further enhanced.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, we are most grateful for the support that we have received for the conclusion of the Host Country Agreement and the related Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements, which will come into force upon signature today. I would like to first of all thank PCA for establishing a framework so as to facilitate the conduct of PCA-administered proceedings in the HKSAR, which amounts to a vote of confidence in the HKSAR and its legal system. I would also like to express our utmost gratitude to the Central People's Government, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (including the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong), for its strong support and assistance throughout the process. I would of course also like to thank your interest and support by attending this ceremony.",
            "In future, we will do our best to facilitate PCA's work in the HKSAR. I would also encourage you and the governments or institutions represented by you to make full use of the HKSAR's arbitration services.",
            "Lastly, at the beginning of the year, may I take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year and good health.",
            "Ends/Sunday, January 4, 2015"

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（一月四日）在北京出席《中華人民共和國政府和常設仲裁法院關於在中華人民共和國香港特別行政區開展爭端解決程序的東道國協議》及相關行政安排備忘錄的簽署儀式的致辭全文︰",
            "尊敬的劉（振民）副部長、尊敬的斯布勒斯秘書長、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：",
            "大家好！首先非常歡迎各位出席這個意義重大的簽署儀式。我很高興見到眾多嘉賓光臨。各位在百忙中抽空光臨，見證簽署《東道國協議》和相關的《行政安排備忘錄》，證明了這項安排的重要性。這兩份文件將確保常設仲裁法院負責管理的程序，可以在香港特別行政區（香港特區）有效進行，和得到相關的支援。",
            "常設仲裁法院",
            "在過去差不多一百二十年來，常設仲裁法院一直致力推動國家之間採用仲裁及其他爭議解決方式。常設仲裁法院現在已發展成為現代化、多元化的仲裁機構，無論處理國際公法或國際私法個案，也能夠滿足國際社會對解決爭議服務急速發展的需求。常設仲裁法院現在提供的解決爭議服務，不單涉及國家，也涉及政府間組織及私人當事人。",
            "就投資者與國家之間的爭議，涉及亞洲的當事人的案件數目在過去數年不斷增加。因此，對解決這類爭議的仲裁服務的需求也相應增加。目前，常設仲裁法院的待辦個案有96宗，其中不少個案涉及一位或多位亞洲當事人。在這發展趨勢下，常設仲裁法院不單在其海牙總部提供服務，更透過與亞洲各成員國簽訂協議，在亞洲不同地方提供解決爭議服務。",
            "香港特區位處亞洲中心，擁有完善的法律制度及豐富的仲裁經驗。香港特區成為常設仲裁法院在亞洲擴展服務的新據點，可以說是順理成章。事實上，常設仲裁法院去年在香港特區進行了第一次聆訊，處理一宗涉及一位外地投資者與一個亞洲國家之間的仲裁個案，整個過程進行得十分順利和成功。",
            "香港特區作為國際及區域仲裁中心",
            "鞏固香港特區作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議中心的地位，是香港特區政府非常重視的政策。在「一國兩制」下，香港特區繼續採用普通法，不單享有司法獨立，也極度重視法治，絕對是進行國際仲裁的理想地方。",
            "香港特區擁有9 000多名本地律師及大律師，也有來自28個司法管轄區的1 300多名外地律師。外國律師事務所在香港特區從事國際仲裁事務並無限制。",
            "另一方面，香港特區一直致力提升有關仲裁和調解等解決爭議方法的法律架構。現行的《仲裁條例》在二○一○年制定，以聯合國最新的《貿法委示範法》為基礎，令香港的仲裁法更便利國際商業社會使用。此外，在香港特區作出的仲裁裁決，可根據《紐約公約》在150個地方執行。在解決涉及在內地投資的爭議方面，香港特區是理想的中立地點。香港特區與內地簽訂了有關相互執行仲裁裁決的安排，令在香港特區作出的仲裁裁決能有效在內地執行。",
            "知名的國際法律組織近年也紛紛在香港特區設立辦事處。在二○○八年，國際商會的國際仲裁院在香港特區設立首個在其巴黎總部以外的秘書處分處。在二○一二年年底，中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會在香港特區設立首個內地以外的仲裁中心，而海牙國際私法會議也在香港特區開設亞太區域辦事處。去年年底，中國海事仲裁委員會香港仲裁中心也在香港特區成立，也是中國海仲委在內地以外的首個仲裁中心。",
            "在《東道國協議》和相關的《行政安排備忘錄》的簽訂後，我相信將進一步鞏固香港特區作為亞太區國際仲裁中心的地位，也可以令香港特區為國際商貿界提供更完善的服務。",
            "結語",
            "《東道國協議》及相關的《行政安排備忘錄》今日得以簽訂並隨即生效，全賴大家的支持。我首先感謝常設仲裁法院建立框架，讓常設仲裁法院負責管理的程序得以在香港特區進行，這猶如對香港特區及其法律制度投下信心一票。我同時也非常感謝中央政府，特別是外交部（包括外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署）在此事對香港特區的支持和協助。我當然也感謝各位出席這次簽署儀式，表達對我們的支持。",
            "我們往後會全力配合常設仲裁法院在香港特區的工作，也鼓勵各位嘉賓和你們所代表的政府或機關，多使用在香港特區的仲裁服務。",
            "最後，在新一年的開始，我借這個機會祝願各位新年快樂，身體健康，事事順利。",
            "謝謝各位。",
