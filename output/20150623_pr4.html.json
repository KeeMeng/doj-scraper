            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, and the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, after attending the opening ceremony of the Prosecution Week 2015 today (June 23):",
            "Reporter: I would like to ask you about Alan Woo's comments. He said ...... the Government did not come up with an alternative plan when faced with opposition. He also talked about that the election committee system can be improved ...... The second question is about the Donald Tsang case. Why did it take so long to make a decision?",
            "Secretary for Justice: If I may deal with the first part of your question and leave the second part of the question to the Director of Public Prosecutions. As I was saying in Cantonese just now, first of all, I don’t think it is now the time to do, whether you call it finger-pointing or blame attribution. I don't think it is constructive to do that. Now that the voting has been done, and although it is disappointing that the proposal put forward by the Government has been vetoed, and therefore we cannot have universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief Executive in 2017. Yes, that is disappointing. But I think at the end of the day we would have to accept the result because it was the decision made by the Legislative Council members. As the Chief Executive has said on some other occasions, and the Chief Secretary for Administration has also mentioned, for the rest of the term of this Government, we would be focusing primarily on livelihood issues, as well as issues such as economic development, because we believe that we have spent quite a fair bit of time, 20 months if not more, discussing political development, focusing on constitutional development and particular universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief Executive. Now that the proposal has been vetoed, it's high time that we return to livelihood issues, to economic development as well as other issues which we believe can improve the community of Hong Kong as a whole, and indeed I think the vast majority of people in Hong Kong will not disagree that we need to do something to improve our livelihood issues. There are so many things that we need to do, property issues, housing issues, transport issues. So I’m quite sure that there will be more than enough for the rest of these two years that we have to tackle. The last point perhaps if I may make is that, yes, in Article 45 of the Basic Law, it is stated quite clearly that we need to have progress towards the ultimate aim of selecting the Chief Executive by way of universal suffrage. It also mentions about gradual development. But it doesn’t mean that we have to deal with constitutional development on a daily basis. The fact that we have just done it, and the fact that we think it's appropriate and desirable to rest a fair bit of time, so that people can sit back, reflect on it, and concentrate on livelihood issues so that the next term of the Government, and in particular, the next Chief Executive can decide whether by that time, it will be the right time to re-start the whole five-step process. No one will disagree that before we can actually re-start the whole five-step process, we need a certain basis, in particular we need a certain consensus, a certain degree or extent of consensus, in the community. Otherwise it will just be yet another fruitless exercise. It will simply cause further controversy, which will not be in anyone's interest. Perhaps I will pass the ball to the DPP to deal with the other part of the question.",
            "Director of Public Prosecutions: In respect of the case against Mr Donald Tsang, as we have said on a number of occasions previously, we understand that the public is legitimately concerned about this case. This is obviously an important case. But there are more than one factor and aspect to this case. There are certain evidence and compilation and aspects of investigation involve investigation outside Hong Kong. As we have said, outside independent counsel's view has been sought and also the Prosecutions Division has been keeping close contact with the ICAC. We have been considering various other matters and the matters are towards the conclusion. I am hopeful and I am optimistic that the case has entered a final conclusion, and conclusion will be reached within the very near future.",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師和刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師今日（六月二十三日）出席2015年檢控週開幕禮後，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者：司長，可否談談政府已多次說今屆政府是不會再做政改，但今屆會否再有其他有關政制的討論？昨日胡漢清說否決後不做政改的工作是違反《基本法》。",
            "律政司司長：首先，我不能同意胡漢清先生昨日的看法。因為，不錯《基本法》四十五條確實是用循序漸進，但不代表每天也不停做政改的工作。政府的立場也很清晰，行政長官已說餘下的任期我們會專注在經濟和民生事務。至於下屆政府會否重啟政改工作，我相信要交由下屆政府，特別是下任行政長官處理。我相信大家也會認同，或社會上有相當聲音說在過去二十個月，政改的問題已討論了很久，某程度上增加了對政改一些議題的認識，但某程度上亦令社會有某程序的撕裂。在政治的層面，我相信香港需要一段休養生息的時期，所以是時候回復專注民生、經濟，希望大家都有些時間可以再想一想往後要做的時候可以怎樣做。但這樣的決定不代表第一，我們以後不會做政改工作，我剛才也說過，下屆政府絕對有空間決定，所以不代表這樣的情況是違反《基本法》。其實由一九九七年到現在，我們也不是每一年或每一屆也做政改工作，所以不可能因為這樣便違反了《基本法》。",
            "記者：司長，但達致行政長官普選是《基本法》寫明的最終目標，如下任政府不做，再推遲會否違反《基本法》這方面的規定？另外，關於曾蔭權案，昨天DPP（刑事檢控專員）說仍在考慮，可否多談一點究竟現時的進度如何？",
            "律政司司長：首先，我沒說過下任政府不會重啟政改。剛才我的說法是下屆政府會否重啟政改，是交由下屆政府決定，特別是下任行政長官，我想他要考慮下屆當時香港的政治生態和情況。坦白說，在否決後，若短期內，舉例明天再啟動，我相信大家也會估計那情況不會因為一、兩天，一、兩個星期，或一、兩個月，突然有很大的轉變，所以其實需要一段時間大家冷靜下來，和反思這二十個月的情況，甚至做一個總結，然後想清楚往後政改重新上路時，大家應採取的是甚麼態度。就曾蔭權先生的案件，或許我交由刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師給大家進一步交代。",
            "刑事檢控專員：就曾蔭權先生的案件，我在不同場合也說過，我們跟廉政公署經常保持溝通，現在還有一些觀點我們需要作最後考慮。亦可以這樣說，即使最保守估計，我期望在短期內就案件會有最後決定，我強調是短期內。",
            "律政司司長：也許我補充一句，當然我明白大家就這案件感到時間上是長了點，但正如以前我和刑事檢控專員在不同場合也說過，除了一些法律問題我們需要小心處理外，這案件涉及的問題不單在香港的範圍，是有一些離開香港的範圍，我相信不需要我重複案件的背景，大家也明白我在說哪方面或因素是超越香港的。所以這些情況需要時間較一些完全屬於香港境內範圍的調查長，我希望大家明白。亦不是說每一個調查方面是完全我們想多快或有何進度便完全可以控制的。",
