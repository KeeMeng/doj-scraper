            "The Prosecution Week 2017 was launched today (June 23) to kick start numerous activities so as to enhance public understanding of the work of the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the criminal justice system in Hong Kong.",
            "Speaking at the event's opening ceremony, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said that one of the inherent and most fundamental spirits of the common law is the rule of law, which is also the theme of this year's Prosecution Week.",
            "Citing various provisions relating to the administration of criminal justice in the Basic Law, Mr Yuen said that they, together with Article 63 and those provisions concerning judicial independence, and plus the protection enshrined in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and the common law, constitute the overall framework within which our criminal justice system operates.",
            "\"Not only does it provide the constitutional and legal guarantee of a person's rights, this framework reflects the very key concepts of the rule of law which are relevant to the administration of criminal justice in Hong Kong, and which are the very key concepts jealously safeguarded by the DoJ,\" he added.",
            "Mr Yuen noted that some people sought to gauge prosecution's performance by looking at conviction rates. He pointed out that prosecutors are not investment managers, and their performance should not be judged by reference to rate of returns. Nor should conviction rates be viewed as GDP, such that the higher the conviction rate, the better the prosecutorial system.",
            "He said, \"Justice should not be just measured by figures, but should be by reference to whether the law is adhered to, whether the evidence is fairly presented, and whether the victim and the accused are fairly treated and their rights duly protected.\"",
            "At the same ceremony, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Keith Yeung, SC, said that when it comes to upholding the rule of law, the Prosecutions Division adopts an unequivocal approach which is clear and emphatic and with no compromise.",
            "\"The Prosecutions Division has very important duties to discharge. The main and most important one is to decide whether to prosecute. When discharging that and all other duties, we are, as provided in paragraph 3.1 of our Prosecution Code, 'required to comply with and promote the rule of law'. That means, importantly, that the prosecution is required to act in the general public interest, but independently as a 'minister of justice'. In making decisions and exercising discretion, a prosecutor must act fairly and dispassionately on the basis of the law, the facts provable by the admissible evidence, other legally relevant information known to the prosecution, and any applicable prosecutorial policies or guidelines,\" Mr Yeung said.",
            "He noted that compliance with the rule of law also means that the prosecution, when making decisions, ought not to be influenced by irrelevant considerations. These irrelevant considerations include investigatory, political or media interest; personal feelings or beliefs of the prosecutor; the possible political effect on the government, any political party, or group or individual; and possible media or public reaction to the decision.",
            "He stressed the importance of prosecutorial independence and pointed out that Article 63 of the Basic Law stipulated that the DoJ shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference.",
            "\"We will do what deemed appropriate in compliance of the rule of law. Such is our privilege; but such is also the weight of our mandate. To implement this onerous but important mandate better, the society’s understanding is vital. This is exactly why it is important for us to continue to organise events like the Prosecution Week,\" he said.",
            "Held for the sixth year, the Prosecution Week 2017 will run until June 30. A host of activities including visits to the DoJ and courts, talks and mock court exercises for schools, will be arranged. This year a law quiz was for the first organised and joined by 12 primary and secondary schools with good response. The winners were presented with awards at today’s ceremony.",

            "2017年檢控週今日（六月二十三日）展開，律政司刑事檢控科將舉辦多項活動，讓市民加深對檢控科工作和香港刑事司法制度的了解。",
            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師在開幕禮上表示，普通法固有和最基本的精神就是法治，這也是檢控週今年的主題。",
            "他提及《基本法》中多項保障刑事公義的條文，加上《基本法》第六十三條、多項確保司法獨立的條文、香港人權法案提供的保障和普通法制度，構成香港的刑事制度整體架構。",
            "他說：「這個架構不單為個人權利提供憲法和法律的保障，還反映法治的基本理念，關乎香港的刑事公義，也是律政司小心翼翼地守護的重要原則。」",
            "談到有人從定罪率來看檢控人員的表現，袁國強指出檢控人員不是基金經理，他們的表現不應從回報率來衡量，而定罪率也不應被視為本地生產總值般，以為定罪率越高，檢控制度越好。",
            "他說：「公義不應以數字衡量，而是應看有否守法、證據是否公平地表述、受害人和被告是否獲得公平對待，以及他們的權利是否得到保障。」",
            "刑事檢控專員楊家雄資深大律師在同一場合發言時說，刑事檢控科在維護法治方面，立場明確、清晰和堅定，而且絕不妥協。",
            "楊家雄說︰「刑事檢控科負責的職務非常重要，當中主要和首要的，是決定是否提出檢控。當履行這及其他所有職務時，我們依據《檢控守則》第3.1段『必須遵行和提倡法治』，即檢控須以廣大公眾的利益為依歸，但同時須獨立自主，負責『秉行公義』。在作出決定和行使酌情權時，檢控人員必須根據法律、可接納的證據所證明的事實、控方已知的其他法律上相關資料，以及任何適用的檢控政策或指引，公正、理智地行事。」",
            "他表示，遵行法治的意思也意味在作出檢控決定時，不應受到任何不相關的考慮因素影響。這些不相關的考慮因素包括調查、政治或傳媒的利益；檢控人員的個人感受或信念；對政府、任何政治團體、組織或個人可能帶來的政治影響；以及媒體或公眾對決定可能產生的反應。",
            "他強調，獨立檢控權非常重要，亦指出《基本法》第六十三條訂明律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉。",
            "他說︰「我們會遵行法治，適當行事。這是我們的權利，亦是我們重任。為了更有效履行這重任，能得到社會的理解是必要的，這正正是我們繼續舉辦檢控週這類活動的主要原因。」",
            "檢控週今日起舉行至六月三十日，是連續第六年舉辦，律政司將舉辦一系列活動，包括到律政司和法庭參觀、以及為學校舉辦講座和模擬法庭。檢控週法律問答比賽今年首次舉行，有十二所中小學參加，反應不俗。在今日的開幕禮上，得獎同學獲頒發獎品。",
