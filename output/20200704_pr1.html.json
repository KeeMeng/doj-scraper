            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at a media session after attending a radio programme today (July 4):",
            "Reporter: Is it appropriate for the Government to say that the protest slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\" is violating the national security law before the courts come to a decision on the matter? Will that give people the impression that the Government is trying to give pressure on the courts in future judgment about such matters?",
            "Secondly, Article 9 of the law says that the HKSAR Government should strengthen supervision over matters such as national security including those relating to schools, universities, the media and the internet. Does the Government have any concrete plans to implement this law? For example, will the Government set up a firewall to block internet sites that may be in violation of the national security law?",
            "Thirdly, could you clarify whether election candidates who have chanted the protest slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\" before will be disqualified in the upcoming Legislative Council election?",
            "Secretary for Justice: The first question relates to the particular phrases that you have mentioned. In relation to that, the Government may have a position that it takes. However, when it comes to the criminal offence that is being charged, ultimately it will be a matter for the court to make a decision as to whether the overall acts, not just the words, but also the acts of the particular defendant amount to an offence under the relevant sections of the national security law. I think that is a very important thing to bear in mind that ultimately, it is the court that looks at whether a particular defendant, not just the words, but the overall acts in context, with intent to be looked into, to decide whether the crime is committed. That is the first question.",
            "I think in relation to your last question, also relating to the words that are being used, I think it is a matter that one must separate from the national security law. The national security law is concerned with act that is going to endanger national security. It is not concerned with other matters. The election is a separate matter that is governed by another legislation that has been enacted in Hong Kong. Insofar as the decision of the Returning Officer is concerned, he or she will have to make a decision as to whether the particular candidate's intent is to genuinely support the Basic Law when they stand for election. There are laws and cases that are explicitly and clearly dealt with how that is to be assessed. Insofar as the decision of the Returning Officer is concerned, he or she will have to look at the relevant evidence of a particular candidate and when necessary, to ask questions in order to come to a decision based on law and evidence.",
            "Reporter: Any clarification on Article 9?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Article 9 is of course important. We are still in the early days, for a start. Secondly, as I have mentioned just now, I think it is important with the media here, that a proper discharge of your duties fairly and objectively in reporting news that have happened cannot possibly cause you into the remit of violating the article in the national security law. In the national security law, there is a very clear requirement of the intent, so if you are objectively, dutifully and professionally reporting the news, there is nothing that is affecting your duties now. Thank you very much.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師和保安局局長李家超今日（七月四日）出席電台節目後會見傳媒的談話內容：",
            "記者：之前都回應了就之前國安法被捕的十個疑犯採集了他們的DNA，為何是次案件需要抽取他們的DNA？和蒐證的關係是甚麼？例如叫口號和DNA有何關係？",
            "另外想問司長，政府就說「光復香港」這個口號有「港獨」的含意，現在見到坊間開始有些新創作或者一些諧音等等去取代這口號，這些新創作會否導致他們有觸犯國安法的風險？另外，條文到現在刊憲仍未有英文版本，是未準備好還是將來也不會有？如果真的沒有，會否影響外籍法官審理這些案件？",
            "律政司司長：昨晚英文版本其實已經刊憲。新華社在七月一日早上亦已發出一個英文版本。我要強調這是一個全國性法律，是全國人大常委會制定的全國性法律，所以法定語文當然是以中文為主體的一份文件。這是很重要的。",
            "至於剛才第二條問題，我們不會就具體的案件作任何評論。至於其他有甚麼詞語會如何，很難就此一概而論，所以我亦不會就着字眼去講。但在條例方面，大家看看國安法的條文，其實很清楚一個重點的字是組織、策劃實施或者參與實施「旨在」分裂國家的行為，「旨在」的意思是指目的是這樣，所以這點大家要清楚。當然，如果你的目的並非搞事，我鼓勵大家不要以身試法，不要嘗試這樣做有沒有事，無謂做這樣的行為。",
            "保安局局長：在警方行使權力的時候，他也要按着法律的規章去做。根據警隊條例，如果警務人員在調查刑事案件的時候，他認為去取一些樣本而對調查案件有幫助，令證據方面可以證明某些罪行，他是可以行使這個權力，警務人員會按着實際情況、案件的內容去決定是否行使這個權力。",
            "記者：昨日有法官表示已獲行政長官委任處理國安法的案件，想問現階段是否這些法官已組班？若是，當中有沒有外籍法官？因為法例並沒有排除外籍法官，可否談談？另外，想再問參選權，國安法列明罪成便會喪失參選權，但沒有說明期限，之前在節目中也有提及會根據法例操作，可否多說一點，會否如基本法委員會委員陳弘毅提議修訂選舉條例？",
            "律政司司長：在指定法官方面，國安法第四十四條寫明相關要做的工作。我們理解有部分法官已獲指定，可以開始相關的工作。條文中沒有具體清楚說明要如何「指定」，但最重要的是行政長官在指定的時候，可以考慮相關情況，亦可以徵詢終審法院首席法官和香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會，這兩點在條文中寫得很清楚。",
            "第二，關於選舉，國安法第三十五條中寫明法庭判定刑罪之後，便會喪失其相關選舉資格，法例是這樣寫的。的而且確，法律條文沒有具體寫明時限，所以我剛才或之前亦講過，其實可以被視為終身喪失資格的一個情況。至於有沒有其他立法的事可以做，可能要由相關政策局作決定。",
