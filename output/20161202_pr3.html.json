            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at a media session on legal proceedings regarding oath-taking today (December 2):",
            "Reporter: Is the Government trying to overthrow the LegCo election result?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Definitely not. By initiating the proceedings, as I was explaining in Cantonese just now, we are acting in accordance with the law. We are acting upon the independent legal advice given by senior counsel. The fact that LegCo members are elected by voters is of course a factor we should respect and that is an important factor. I should stress that. However, it’s equally important that all LegCo members and indeed the Legislative Council itself should act in accordance with the law. And I think this point is made crystal clear by the judgment of the Court of Appeal. It is stressed time and again in the judgment of the Court of Appeal that in Hong Kong the supreme law is the Basic Law. And all people, including the Legislature and members of the LegCo, are bound by our law, including the Basic Law. And therefore the legal action has absolutely nothing to do with overthrowing or overturning the intentions and wishes of the voters. Thank you.",
