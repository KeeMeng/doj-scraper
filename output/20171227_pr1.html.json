            "The Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam; the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC; the Secretary for Transport and Housing, Mr Frank Chan Fan; and the Acting Secretary for Security, Mr Sonny Au, held a press conference this afternoon (December 27) on the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on approving the Co-operation Arrangement between the Mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Establishment of the Port at the West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link for Implementing Co-location Arrangement. Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Justice.",
            "Let me summarise what I said just now in English.",
            "The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) fully appreciates that the Hong Kong community is concerned with the legal basis for implementing the co-location arrangement. This is why on different occasions in the past, I and other Government officials have repeatedly pointed out that in the course of discussing co-location, it has always been stressed that the Co-location Arrangement should be consistent with the \"one country, two systems\" policy and shall not contravene the Basic Law of the HKSAR. Against this background, both sides proposed to adopt the \"Three-step Process\" to implement the Co-location Arrangement. The Decision made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) today has clearly stated that the co-location arrangement as provided for in the Co-operation Arrangement is consistent with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the HKSAR’s Basic Law.",
            "Both the NPCSC Decision and the Explanation made by Director Zhang Xiaoming (Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council) have explained the legal basis for implementing the Co-location Arrangement in detail. I therefore think there is no need for me to repeat them here, but I would, however, like to highlight two main aspects, which I understand is of interest to the Hong Kong community. The first aspect concerns Article 18 of the Basic Law; and the other aspect concerns the questions such as which specific provision in the Basic Law can be invoked to implement co-location as well as questions of authorisation and relevant matters. The Explanation has addressed both these two aspects, and I would like to draw your attention to the relevant contents, in particular the following points.",
            "First of all, Article 18 of the Basic Law provides that \"National laws shall not be applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region except for those listed in Annex III to this Law. Laws listed in Annex III to [the Basic Law] shall be confined to those relating to defence and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the [HKSAR] as specified by this Law\".",
            "The Explanation explains that the Co-location Arrangement will not be in contravention of Article 18. The reason is largely two-fold:",
            "(1) What Article 18 of the Basic Law stipulates is the extension and application of national laws in the entire HKSAR, including the relevant contexts and the route through which they become applicable. Put shortly, the area of application of the relevant national laws stipulated in Article 18 is the entire HKSAR. They are mainly implemented by the HKSAR and they are applicable to all persons in the HKSAR. On the other hand, as regards the application of national laws in the West Kowloon Station Mainland Port Area, their scope of application is only confined to the Mainland Port Area. They are implemented by the relevant Mainland authorities and they are mainly applicable to high-speed rail passengers present in the Mainland Port Area. The situation therefore is different from the case of application of national laws in the HKSAR under Article 18 of the Basic Law, and therefore there is no question of Article 18 of the Basic Law being contravened.",
            "(2) The Co-operation Arrangement further expressly provides that for the purposes of the application of the laws of the Mainland and the delineation of jurisdiction, the West Kowloon Station Mainland Port Area will be regarded as \"being situated in the Mainland\". A similar provision was also adopted in the Shenzhen Bay Port Area model. Upon approval of the Co-operation Arrangement and the making of the decision by the NPCSC, this would provide full and sufficient legal basis for the application of national laws solely in the West Kowloon Station Mainland Port Area.",
            "On the other hand, the Explanation also deals with the question of whether any specific provisions may be invoked to implement the Co-location Arrangement as well as the question such as authorisation. In the past, the HKSAR and the Mainland authorities repeatedly studied different proposals, including the proposal to invoke Article 20 of the Basic Law. However, both sides also notice that the Hong Kong community has many different views as to whether Article 20 of the Basic Law is applicable or whether it is the best option. As pointed out by the Explanation, Co-location arrangement is a new situation encountered in the course of implementing the \"one country, two systems\" policy. Therefore, the fact that the community has many different views is normal and understandable. Upon full consideration, the NPCSC decides that the more appropriate option is for the NPCSC to approve the Cooperation Arrangement.",
            "The NPC is the highest organ of state power, whilst the NPCSC is its permanent body. The advantage of NPCSC's aforesaid approach is that it resolved the issues from a constitutionally higher level, and can thereby avoid disputes such as questions of authorisation and the like, and can be regarded as a more prudent way of dealing with the matter. This also reflects the fact that NPCSC is willing to consider different views expressed by the Hong Kong community.",
            "Thank you.",

            "行政長官林鄭月娥、律政司司長袁國強資深大律師、運輸及房屋局局長陳帆和署理保安局局長區志光今日（十二月二十七日）下午就全國人民代表大會常務委員會《關於批准〈內地與香港特別行政區關於在廣深港高鐵西九龍站設立口岸實施「一地兩檢」的合作安排〉的決定》舉行記者會。以下是袁國強的開場發言：",
            "各位傳媒朋友︰",
            "特區政府完全理解香港社會關注落實「一地兩檢」的法理基礎。正如以往在不同場合，我及其他政府官員多次指出，特區與內地商討「一地兩檢」時，一直強調「一地兩檢」的安排必須符合「一國兩制」及不違反《基本法》。在這大前提下，雙方建議採用「三步走」的方式去落實「一地兩檢」。今日全國人大常委會就「一地兩檢」作出的決定，亦非常清楚說明「一地兩檢」的安排符合國家憲法和香港特區《基本法》。",
            "全國人大常委會的《決定》，以及國務院港澳辦張曉明主任的《說明》，已就落實「一地兩檢」的法律基礎作出相當詳細的說明，我相信不需要在此重複。我理解社會上比較關心兩方面。第一方面涉及《基本法》第18條；另一方面涉及引用《基本法》哪一條條文去落實「一地兩檢」以及授權等相關問題。這兩方面《說明》都有作出解說，我希望大家可以留意相關內容，包括以下重點。",
            "首先，《基本法》第18條規定，「全國性法律除列入本法附件三者外，不在香港特別行政區實施」，亦規定「任何列入附件三的法律，限於有關國防、外交和其他按本法規定不屬香港特別行政區自治範圍的法律」。",
            "《說明》解述「一地兩檢」不會違反《基本法》第18條。主要原因有兩個。第一，《基本法》第18條規定的是全國性法律延伸適用至整個香港特區的情況，包括有關範疇及其適用途徑。簡單而言，《基本法》第18條規定中有關全國性法律實施的範圍是整個香港特區，實施主體是香港特區本身，適用對象是香港特區的所有人。而在西九龍站「內地口岸區」實施全國性法律，其實施範圍只限於「內地口岸區」，實施主體是內地的有關機構，適用對象主要是處於「內地口岸區」的高鐵乘客。這種情況與《基本法》第18條所規定的情況完全不同，所以不會出現抵觸香港特區《基本法》第18條規定的問題。",
            "第二，《合作安排》明確規定，就內地法律的適用以及管轄權的劃分而言，西九龍站「內地口岸區」將被視為「處於內地」。相類似的法律條文在深圳灣模式亦有採用。由於全國人大常委會批准《合作安排》，因此亦為將「內地口岸區」視為「處於內地」的條文提供法律基礎。",
            "另一方面，社會上曾就應引用《基本法》哪一條條文以及授權等問題進行討論。可以告訴大家的是，在過去的討論，特區及內地曾反覆研究不同建議，這些建議包括引用《基本法》第20條的建議。但兩地留意到香港社會上就《基本法》第20條是否適用，或是否最佳方法存在不同意見。正如《說明》指出，「一地兩檢」是實踐「一國兩制」中遇到的新情況，因此社會上有不同意見完全正常及可以理解。因此，經全盤考慮後，全國人大常委會認為以「批准」《決定》的方式更適當。",
            "全國人大是最高國家權力機關，而全國人大常委會是全國人大的常設機關。全國人大常委會上述處理方法，優點是在憲制基礎上以更高的層次去處理問題，避免就是否應授權或《基本法》第20條的解釋等爭議，可以說是以更穩妥的方式去處理相關問題，亦反映全國人大常委會願意聆聽不同意見。",
