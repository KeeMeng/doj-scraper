            "The Steering Committee on Mediation today (June 22) launched a six-week public consultation to seek views on whether to enact an apology legislation in Hong Kong.",
            "Following a mishap, a party causing injury may wish to convey his apology to the injured person for the loss and suffering sustained. Even if the former party genuinely believes that he has done nothing wrong, he may nevertheless still wish to convey his condolences or sympathy to the other party out of goodwill and benevolence. However, there is a general reluctance to make apology and lawyers are often reluctant to advise their clients to apologise. This is because the legal consequences of making an apology are not entirely clear, and that an apology may be relied on to establish liability in relevant legal proceedings.",
