            "The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, visited several ministries and authorities in Beijing today (July 28), signing records of meetings with the Supreme People's Court (SPC) and the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) to strengthen co-operation and exchanges of legal and dispute resolution services between the Mainland and Hong Kong.",
            "In the morning, Ms Cheng called on the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) of the State Council, and met with Deputy Director of the HKMAO Mr Deng Zhonghua, to review the latest developments of Hong Kong. Ms Cheng pointed out that the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL) has restored order and stability in society while demonstrating the trust of the Central Authorities in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. She thanked the HKMAO for its full support for the National Security Law Legal Forum - Security Brings Prosperity, organised by the Department of Justice (DoJ), which enhanced the understanding and awareness of the NSL among the public. At the meeting, Ms Cheng also discussed the participation of Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution professionals in the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) development.",
            "In the afternoon, Ms Cheng met with the President of the SPC, Mr Zhou Qiang, and signed a record of meeting for enhancing exchanges and co-operation with Executive Vice-President of the SPC Ms He Rong. The key features include providing practical Mainland legal training courses for Hong Kong legal practitioners who have passed the GBA Legal Professional Examination, rendering support to Hong Kong legal practitioners to join the International Commercial Expert Committee of the SPC and serve as specially invited mediators and assessors of people's courts in the Mainland, and promoting and proactively taking forward the work on mutual recognition of and assistance to bankruptcy proceedings. Ms Cheng highlighted that, by staying committed to the basis of \"one country\" and leveraging the benefits of \"two systems\", nine agreements on mutual legal assistance arrangements in civil and commercial matters were signed between the DoJ and the SPC after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, fully reflecting the importance of Article 95 of the Basic Law and the uniqueness of \"one country, two systems\". She said the DoJ will continue to explore further co-operation arrangements to meet the actual needs arising from the increasingly close socio-economic ties between Hong Kong and the Mainland.",
            "Ms Cheng then met with the Procurator-General of the SPP, Mr Zhang Jun, and signed a record of meeting to strengthen the learning and training for the public prosecutors of both sides, and promote the social development and the rule of law of the two places. Ms Cheng said that putting in place a standing arrangement for professional staff from both sides to share their work experiences would be conducive to their future professional development.",

            "鄭若驊上午拜訪國務院港澳事務辦公室（港澳辦），與副主任鄧中華會面，討論香港最新發展。鄭若驊指出，《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》（《香港國安法》）令香港由亂及治，也展示了中央對香港特別行政區的信任。她感謝港澳辦全力支持律政司早前舉辦的「國安家好」法律論壇，增進各界對《香港國安法》的了解和認識。鄭若驊在會上也談及香港法律和爭議解決業界參與「一帶一路」建設和粵港澳大灣區發展的情況。",
            "下午，鄭若驊與最高人民法院院長周強會面，並與常務副院長賀榮簽署加強交流合作的會談紀要，主要內容包括為通過粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試的香港法律界人士安排內地司法實務培訓；支持香港法律界人士加入最高人民法院國際商事專家委員會以及擔任內地人民法院特邀調解員、人民陪審員以及積極推進相互認可和協助破產程序有關工作等事宜。鄭若驊指出自回歸後，律政司與最高人民法院已經簽訂了九份民商事法律互助的文件，充分展示《基本法》第九十五條的重要意義，體現「一國兩制」的獨特性，堅守「一國」之本、善用「兩制」之利。鄭若驊表示律政司會繼續積極探討合作安排，以回應兩地社會經濟聯繫日趨緊密的實際需要。",
            "接着，鄭若驊與最高人民檢察院檢察長張軍會面和簽署會談紀要，目的是加強雙方刑事檢控人員的研修和培訓，共同推動兩地社會發展和法治進步。鄭若驊指出設立恆常安排讓兩地專業人員交流工作經驗，會有助他們日後的專業發展。",
