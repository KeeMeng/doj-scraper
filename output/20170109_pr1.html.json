            "Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2017 today (January 9):",
            "Chief Justice, Members of the Judiciary, Chairman of the Bar Association, President of the Law Society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,",
            "On behalf of the Department of Justice, may I extend our warmest welcome to all of you here, especially to our guests from other jurisdictions.",
            "This ceremony, previously known as the Opening of the Assizes, was held until 1973. In 1980, this ceremony was revived and its name was changed to the Opening of the Legal Year. Sir Denys Roberts, the Chief Justice at the time, explained at the revival of this ceremony in 1980 that there were three reasons for holding the Opening of the Legal Year (Note 1). One of them is to focus the public's attention on the courts and the legal profession, and also to enhance their knowledge of the system of justice.",
            "Despite the passage of time, this reason remains valid. First, as our community has become more developed and hence more complex, the interests of the different sectors of our community may clash from time to time. The rule of law is the ultimate institution for protecting and balancing those conflicting interests. Second, with better education and free flow of information (especially with the popular use of social media and the Internet), members of the public are more aware of their rights and more active in the discussion of law-related topics. At times, discussions are polarised or politicised. Third, since the concept of \"one country, two systems\" is a novel one, it is natural that divergent views do arise during the implementation of the Basic Law.",
            "The combined effect of all these makes it more important now than ever to foster a proper understanding of the concept of the rule of law. In this regard, much efforts have been made by the stakeholders, including the legal profession. However, there are also worrying signs. Perhaps I can start off by quoting from a speech recently delivered by the Honourable Mr Justice Joseph Fok, a Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (Note 2):",
            "\"25. There is a tendency in Hong Kong, although this phenomenon is certainly not unique to this jurisdiction, for litigants to incant the words 'rule of law' in support of their case as if it were a mantra. Thus, in some judicial reviews, it is not unheard of for it to be contended that a decision or an act of a Government department is contrary to the rule of law. In other cases, one finds both sides claiming that a court decision otherwise than in their favour would not comply with the rule of law. In Lord Bingham's book ['The Rule of Law'], he gives the example of the US Supreme Court case of Bush v Gore, which decided who won the presidential election in 2000 and in which the rule of law was invoked by both sides. Lord Bingham refers to one academic's commentary recognising 'a widespread impression that utterance of those magic words meant little more than \"Hooray for our side\"'.",
            "\"26. Closer to home here in Hong Kong, there have been many articles in the media about recent court decisions relating to prosecutions arising out of the Occupy Protests in 2014. Some have been in favour of the outcomes and some have criticised them. Different people will, of course, have different points of view. However, it is disheartening ... when one sees a commentator saying that a particular result is, or is not, consistent with the rule of law simply because he disagrees with the particular outcome. That sort of comment has a tendency to give readers a false impression as to what the rule of law means.",
            "\"27. If that impression starts to take root, it will almost certainly do a disservice to the rule of law ....\"",
            "It is indeed unfortunate that the expression \"the rule of law\" has sometimes been used by some members of the community (including those who are legally trained) as a slogan to advance their own political causes. Due enforcement of the criminal law is sometimes criticised by these people simply because they support the political stance advocated by the defendants, in total disregard to the evidence and the court's ruling. Likewise, due enforcement of solemn obligations laid down in the Basic Law is depicted as the Government's disregard to democracy, as if voters' support is a licence to disregard legal requirements. Needless to say, we need to stay vigilant in safeguarding the rule of law and that Government actions are open to scrutiny and criticism. However, unduly politicised criticism in disregard to one's legal obligation is the very antithesis of the rule of law.",
            "In the same vein, politicised or illegitimate criticisms about judicial decisions should be avoided. As the former Chief Justice Mr Andrew Li once remarked (Note 3):",
            "\"Court decisions are and should be subjected to public debate. The right to scrutinise judgments of the courts is a constitutional right which should be vigorously exercised in a free society. Further, such public debate would have the benefit of informing and educating the public about the judicial system and the issues at stake. But to maintain the independence of the Judiciary, it would not be acceptable or desirable for judges to have to defend their judgments in the political arena. It is therefore important that the right to scrutinise court judgments should be responsibly exercised.\"",
            "The key word in Mr Andrew Li's observation is \"responsible\". Unless discussions are conducted objectively and rationally, they cannot be \"responsible\". To achieve this end, one should not simply test the outcome of a judicial decision against one's political belief. Instead, the focus should be the reasons set out in the judgment. Apart from open justice and due process, judicial reasoning is the bedrock of our common law system. Hence, instead of using non-legal (such as political) reasons to attack a judgment, one should try to examine and understand the reasons set out in a judgment.",
            "Unfortunately, from time to time some people feel free to overstep the boundary. Some queried whether a judge's decision was motivated by his political bias; others even deployed foul language to lodge wholly unjustified personal attacks against judges. Worst still, there are cases where threatening objects were sent to judges or other officials responsible for administering the law. All these abuses must be stopped.",
            "As Sir Sydney Kentridge, QC, pointed out (Note 4), \"The real mischief of unwarranted attacks on the motives and integrity of the judges ... is not any hurt to the judge's feelings; it is that they undermine that respect for the judiciary without which ... the foundations of the rule of law are undermined.\"",
            "There is already a trend in our community that discussions of public affairs are polarised and politicised. There may be many reasons for it, and surely achieving good governance is fairly and squarely a responsibility of the Government. However, in the interests of Hong Kong, every effort should be made to prevent this trend from eroding the foundation of the rule of law.",
            "In this regard, I feel obliged to add another point. The Director of Public Prosecutions recently wrote in the yearly review of the Prosecutions Division for the year 2015 as follows (Note 5):",
            "\"... it is saddening to see that when my fellow colleagues attended court, especially in those perceived to be politically sensitive ones, they on growing occasions were subject to groundless, malicious and unfair personal verbal abuse from certain members of the public. It must not be forgotten that that any act of lashing out in court proceedings, committed with no other intention except to bring the Judiciary or prosecution into disrepute, simply cannot be a proper exercise of one's freedom of expression.\"",
            "I fully echo the views of the Director of Public Prosecutions. A respect for the rule of law includes a respect for the judicial process. When our prosecutors conduct cases in court, they are performing the constitutional duty of criminal prosecution in an apolitical manner. The prosecutors, as part of the system of administration of justice, deserve respect instead of abuse.",
            "On 7 November, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), in exercise of its power under Article 158 of the Basic Law, pronounced an interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law (the Interpretation), which concerns the constitutional duty on the part of certain specified categories of public officials, when assuming office, to swear to uphold the Basic Law and to swear allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China.",
            "The making of the Interpretation has attracted much attention, both locally and internationally. On my part, I am confident that the rule of law in Hong Kong does and will remain well and alive after the Interpretation. The way in which our judges professionally handled the relevant legal proceedings during and subsequent to the making of the Interpretation proves my point beyond doubt.",
            "As I stressed earlier, deliberations on the rule of law should be objective and rational. To properly consider the role of Article 158 of the Basic Law, it is worth highlighting the following observations made by Sir Anthony Mason, a leading jurist in the common law world and formerly a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal:",
            "\"The conjunction of a common law system under a national law within the larger framework of Chinese constitutional law is a fundamental aspect of the principle 'one country, two systems'. Article 158 is the link between the two systems. It draws a distinction between the power of final interpretation which is vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC ... and the power of final adjudication which is vested in the CFA.\" (Note 6)",
            "\"Despite the tensions which it may generate from time to time, art 158 is an ingenious link between the two legal systems. Whether it is viewed from a constitutional, legal or political perspective, art 158 is central to the Hong Kong conception of the rule of law. Debate about the rule of law in Hong Kong must recognise and proceed from the centrality of art 158. In the words of Professor Vernon Bogdanor, '[f]or believers in the rule of law ... power should lie ... with the constitution'.\" (Note 7)",
            "For future purposes, may I also venture to suggest that matters that can be properly handled within Hong Kong's legal or judicial system should be left to be dealt with at the Hong Kong level as much as possible. Such an approach is certainly not a disrespect to the NPCSC's constitutional jurisdiction to make interpretation pursuant to Article 158 of the Basic Law. Instead, it is the best way to demonstrate that the \"one country, two systems\" policy does work robustly and successfully, and that the institutions devised under the Basic Law, including the judicial system, possess the quality and competence to meet such challenges as they arise.",
            "The last topic that I wish to touch on relates to our policy in promoting Hong Kong as a leading centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "The Department of Justice is pushing for the introduction of two sets of amendments to the Arbitration Ordinance. The first will clarify the law on the arbitrability of intellectual property disputes. The second will allow third party funding of arbitration or mediation. In addition, we are seeking to introduce an apology legislation, which will clarify the legal consequences of making an apology, so as to enhance the chances of reaching amicable settlement (whether in the course of mediation or otherwise). As and when these legislative works are completed, the legal framework of Hong Kong concerning dispute resolution will stay in the forefront of international development.",
            "The other latest development concerns our home-grown Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC), which has established itself as one of the leading arbitration institutes both internationally and within the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "Previously there was a plan to move the HKIAC from its current premises at Exchange Square II to the future legal hub which comprises the three blocks at the Justice Place and the former French Mission Building nearby. Having considered the views of the international arbitration community (including the survey results of the Global Arbitration Review which gave top rankings to the HKIAC's facilities at the Exchange Square II premises) and the request of HKIAC, I am glad to announce that the Government has decided that HKIAC will continue to stay at its current premises. Not only would this enable the HKIAC to maintain its competitive edge, we would also have more space at the future legal hub to house more internationally reputable legal or dispute resolution organisations.",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, this Opening of the Legal Year is the last one witnessed by this term of the Hong Kong SAR Government. I am deeply honoured to have the opportunity to serve as the Secretary for Justice during such a challenging time of Hong Kong. May I take this opportunity to express my utmost gratitude to all those who have contributed to the maintenance of the rule of law in Hong Kong, including members of the Judiciary and the two branches of the legal profession. My thanks also go to all my colleagues in the Department of Justice (lawyers or otherwise). Many of them are, in my view, the unsung heroes in our efforts to safeguard the rule of law.",
            "On this note, it remains for me to wish all of you and the Hong Kong SAR a fruitful 2017.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Note 1: See the speech of the Chief Justice, Sir Denys Roberts, at the Opening of the Legal Year on January 7, 1980.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（一月九日）在二○一七年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭全文（中文譯本）：",
            "終審法院首席法官、各位司法機構人員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：",
            "首先，我謹代表律政司歡迎各位嘉賓，特別是來自其他司法管轄區的嘉賓。",
            "這典禮從前被稱為Opening of the Assizes，但在一九七三年後停止舉行。此典禮在一九八○年恢復舉行，名稱改為法律年度開啟典禮（Opening of the Legal Year）。當這典禮在一九八○年恢復舉辦時，當時的首席按察司羅弼時爵士解釋，舉辦法律年度開啟典禮有三個理由（註一）。其中一個理由是為了讓公眾聚焦法院及法律界的事宜，並加強他們對司法制度的認識。",
            "雖然時移勢易，上述理由仍然適用。首先，當我們的社會隨着發展變得複雜，社會上不同利益可能不時會出現衝突，而法治則是守護和平衡不同利益的最終制度。第二，隨着更好的教育及資訊自由（特別是社交媒體和互聯網的普及使用），公眾人士更明白其權利及更積極參與有關法律議題的討論。有時候，討論變得兩極化和政治化。第三，由於「一國兩制」是個嶄新概念，在落實《基本法》時出現意見分歧是自然不過的事。",
            "上述發展令在現今年代就法治這概念締造恰當的理解比從前更為重要。在這方面，包括法律界的持份者做了大量工作。然而，有些跡象卻教人憂慮。也許我可先引述終審法院常任法官霍兆剛最近一篇演說的相關部分（註二）：",
            "「25.雖然這現象不是本司法管轄區獨有，在香港有一趨勢，訴訟當事人往往口號式地借用『法治』一詞。因此，在一些司法覆核案件，聲稱一個決定或一政府部門的行為違反法治並非聞所未聞。在其他案件中，雙方均指法院的裁決若對他們不利，則是不符合法治。在兵咸勳爵（Lord Bingham）的書《法治》（The Rule of Law）中，他便以美國最高法院布殊訴戈爾案作為例子。該案需決定誰在二○○○年的總統大選勝出，而雙方亦以法治為其理據。兵咸勳爵引述一名學者的評論指出，『採取這魔法詞彙 （magic words，即「法治」）已普遍被視為與為一方歡呼做勢無異。』",
            "26.在香港的媒體，有不少文章論述二○一四年『佔領』事件的檢控。部分支持當中結果，部分則作批評。不同人士當然會有不同觀點。但當看到評論員只因他不同意某個結果，便指該結果符合或不符合法治……確實令人沮喪。如斯評論每每向讀者灌輸法治的錯誤印象。",
            "27.倘若這些印象開始生根，必定會對法治造成損害。……」",
            "有的時候，社會上部分人士（包括曾受法律培訓的人士）為了增加政治籌碼，不時以法治作為口號。這情況確實不幸。恰當的刑事檢控有時被這些人士批評，只因他們支持被告的政治立場，而完全罔顧證據及法院的判決。同樣地，執行《基本法》下的莊嚴責任，則被形容為政府漠視民主，尤如選民的支持可化作無視法定要求的盾牌。當然，維護法治必須時刻警惕，政府的行為亦必須受到監察和批評。但漠視法律責任，以及不恰當的政治化批評，無疑與法治背道而馳。",
            "同樣道理，我們亦須避免就司法判決作政治化或不恰當的批評。前終審法院首席法官李國能曾解述（註三）：",
            "「公眾往往會評論法庭的裁決，這是理所當然的。在一個自由的社會裡，仔細評議法庭的判決，是憲法賦予的權利，人民理當積極行使。再者，公開討論法庭的裁決，有助公眾人士進一步了解司法制度的運作和所討論事情的核心。可是，就維持司法獨立而言，法官不應亦不能在政治舞台上替自己的判決辯護。因此，人民行使對法庭的判決進行評議的權利時，必須是負責任的。」",
            "李國能法官以上解述的關鍵詞為「負責任」。除非討論是客觀及理性地進行，否則不可能視作「負責任」。要達致這目標，不應單以一己的政治信念作為評核司法判決結果的準則。反之，焦點應放在判詞中列舉的理據。除了公開公義和程序公義，司法理據是普通法的基石。因此，與其以非法律（例如政治）理由去攻擊法院判決，應嘗試探究和理解判詞中的理據。",
            "不幸地，部分人士不時超越界線。有的質疑法官的判決是否受其政治偏見所影響；亦有以粗言穢語對法官作毫無根據的人身攻擊。更有甚者，有人向法官或其他執行法律的人士寄送具威嚇性物品。所有此類不當行為必須遏止。",
            "正如Sir Sydney Kentridge QC指出（註四）：「就法官的意圖和誠信作出不恰當的攻擊……其真正損害不在於法官的感受，而在於削弱公眾對司法機關的尊重。若司法機關得不到公眾敬重……法治的根基也會隨之而受損害。」",
            "在我們的社會，公共事務的討論變得兩極化和政治化已成為趨勢。箇中成因繁多，而達致良好管治，政府責無旁貸。然而，為了香港的利益，必須全力防止這趨勢侵腐法治的基礎。",
            "在這方面，我須補充另一觀點。刑事檢控專員最近撰寫二○一五年刑事檢控科工作回顧時指出（註五）：",
            "「……對於有同事在出庭檢控，特別是在處理一些被視為政治敏感的案件時遭某些市民無理、惡意、不公的謾駡的事件有所增加，我實在感到痛心。我們不可忘記，純粹為了侮辱司法機構或檢控機關，而在法院程序進行期間破口大駡，絕不能稱為言論自由的恰當行使。」",
            "我完全認同刑事檢控專員的意見。尊重法治包含尊重司法程序。當檢控人員出庭處理案件時，他們是以政治中立的態度履行刑事檢控的憲制責任。作為公義制度的一分子，檢控人員應得到尊重，而非辱罵。",
            "二○一六年十一月七日，全國人民代表大會常務委員會（全國人大常委會）行使《基本法》第一百五十八條賦予的權力，就《基本法》第一百零四條作出解釋（釋法）。該條文涉及若干指定公職人員在就職時應宣誓擁護《基本法》和效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區的憲制責任。",
            "該釋法在本地及國際間引起廣泛關注。就我而言，我有信心香港的法治仍然會在釋法後屹立不倒。觀乎法官如何專業地處理釋法期間和其後的相關案件，已能毫無疑問地證實此論點。",
            "正如我早前強調，有關法治的討論必須客觀和理性。要恰當地考慮《基本法》第一百五十八條的角色，值得重溫普通法世界的著名法學家及前終審法院非常任法官梅師賢爵士以下的解述：",
            "「『一國兩制』原則的一個根本特點，是在中國憲法框架下的全國性法律融入普通法制度。第一百五十八條是兩個制度的連結。它區分了全國人民代表大會常務委員會的最終解釋權……和終審法院的終審權。」（註六）「雖然它可能偶爾衍生緊張情況，第一百五十八條是兩個法律制度之間的巧妙連結。無論是從憲制、法律或政治角度而言，第一百五十八條是香港法治的中心。討論香港法治，必須認同第一百五十八條，並以其為中軸。套用Vernon Bogdanor教授的說法：『對相信法治的人而言……權力源自憲法……』」（註七）",
            "我亦希望指出一個觀點，為未來提供參考。若能在香港的法律或司法制度內解決的事宜，應盡量在香港層面處理。這方式並不代表不尊重全國人大常委會根據《基本法》第一百五十八條享有的解釋權，而是證明「一國兩制」政策能有效和成功地落實，以及《基本法》下設定的機制（包括司法制度），具有質素和能力駕馭挑戰的最佳方式。",
            "我最後希望一談的議題涉及我們推廣香港作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決中心的政策。",
            "律政司正積極引進就《仲裁條例》的兩項修改。其一旨在澄清知識產權爭議的可仲裁性，其二則容許第三者資助仲裁或調解。再者，我們亦希望引入道歉法例，從而澄清道歉的法律後果，增加（在調解期間或其他情況）達成和解的機會。當相關立法工作完成後，香港在爭議解決方面的法律框架將繼續維持在國際發展的前端。",
            "另一最新發展關乎在本地成立，並已在亞太區及國際間享有領導地位的香港國際仲裁中心。",
            "早前有計劃將該中心從其現址，即交易廣場二期，遷移到由律政中心三座大樓和毗鄰的前法國外方傳道大樓組成的「法律樞紐」。在考慮國際仲裁社會的意見（包括《環球仲裁評論》（Global Arbitration Review）的調查結果給予該中心於交易廣場的設施之極高評價），以及該中心的要求，我很高興向大家宣布，政府已決定香港國際仲裁中心將繼續留於現址。此舉不但能令該中心維持其競爭力，亦同時令「法律樞紐」能騰出更多空間去迎接更多國際知名的法律或爭議解決機構。",
            "女士們、先生們，這次是本屆政府見證的最後一次法律年度開啟典禮。我深感榮幸能在這段香港充滿挑戰的時間出任律政司司長。我希望藉此機會，向包括司法界和法律界的兩個專業組別的所有曾為維護法治作出貢獻的人士表示感謝。我當然亦感謝我所有律政司的同事（無論是律師與否）。在我眼中，他們很多均是默默捍衞法治的無名英雄。",
            "最後，我祝願各位和香港特區有一個豐盛的二○一七年。",
            "謝謝！",

            "In Lord Bingham's book ['The Rule of Law'], he gives the example of the US Supreme Court case of Bush v Gore, which decided who won the presidential election in 2000 and in which the rule of law was invoked by both sides",
            "Lord Bingham refers to one academic's commentary recognising 'a widespread impression that utterance of those magic words meant little more than \"Hooray for our side\"'.",
            "Closer to home here in Hong Kong, there have been many articles in the media about recent court decisions relating to prosecutions arising out of the Occupy Protests in 2014",
            "Some have been in favour of the outcomes and some have criticised them",
            "Different people will, of course, have different points of view",
            "However, it is disheartening ..",
            "when one sees a commentator saying that a particular result is, or is not, consistent with the rule of law simply because he disagrees with the particular outcome",
            "That sort of comment has a tendency to give readers a false impression as to what the rule of law means.",
            "If that impression starts to take root, it will almost certainly do a disservice to the rule of law ....\"",
            "It is indeed unfortunate that the expression \"the rule of law\" has sometimes been used by some members of the community (including those who are legally trained) as a slogan to advance their own political causes",
            "Due enforcement of the criminal law is sometimes criticised by these people simply because they support the political stance advocated by the defendants, in total disregard to the evidence and the court's ruling",
            "Likewise, due enforcement of solemn obligations laid down in the Basic Law is depicted as the Government's disregard to democracy, as if voters' support is a licence to disregard legal requirements",
            "Needless to say, we need to stay vigilant in safeguarding the rule of law and that Government actions are open to scrutiny and criticism",
            "However, unduly politicised criticism in disregard to one's legal obligation is the very antithesis of the rule of law.",
            "In the same vein, politicised or illegitimate criticisms about judicial decisions should be avoided",
            "As the former Chief Justice Mr Andrew Li once remarked (Note 3):",
            "\"Court decisions are and should be subjected to public debate",
            "The right to scrutinise judgments of the courts is a constitutional right which should be vigorously exercised in a free society",
            "Further, such public debate would have the benefit of informing and educating the public about the judicial system and the issues at stake",
            "But to maintain the independence of the Judiciary, it would not be acceptable or desirable for judges to have to defend their judgments in the political arena",
            "It is therefore important that the right to scrutinise court judgments should be responsibly exercised.\"",
            "The key word in Mr Andrew Li's observation is \"responsible\"",
            "Unless discussions are conducted objectively and rationally, they cannot be \"responsible\"",
            "To achieve this end, one should not simply test the outcome of a judicial decision against one's political belief",
            "Instead, the focus should be the reasons set out in the judgment",
            "Apart from open justice and due process, judicial reasoning is the bedrock of our common law system",
            "Hence, instead of using non-legal (such as political) reasons to attack a judgment, one should try to examine and understand the reasons set out in a judgment.",
            "Unfortunately, from time to time some people feel free to overstep the boundary",
            "Some queried whether a judge's decision was motivated by his political bias; others even deployed foul language to lodge wholly unjustified personal attacks against judges",
            "Worst still, there are cases where threatening objects were sent to judges or other officials responsible for administering the law",
            "All these abuses must be stopped.",
            "As Sir Sydney Kentridge, QC, pointed out (Note 4), \"The real mischief of unwarranted attacks on the motives and integrity of the judges ..",
            "is not any hurt to the judge's feelings; it is that they undermine that respect for the judiciary without which ..",
            "the foundations of the rule of law are undermined.\"",
            "There is already a trend in our community that discussions of public affairs are polarised and politicised",
            "There may be many reasons for it, and surely achieving good governance is fairly and squarely a responsibility of the Government",
            "However, in the interests of Hong Kong, every effort should be made to prevent this trend from eroding the foundation of the rule of law.",
            "In this regard, I feel obliged to add another point",
            "The Director of Public Prosecutions recently wrote in the yearly review of the Prosecutions Division for the year 2015 as follows (Note 5):",
            "it is saddening to see that when my fellow colleagues attended court, especially in those perceived to be politically sensitive ones, they on growing occasions were subject to groundless, malicious and unfair personal verbal abuse from certain members of the public",
            "It must not be forgotten that that any act of lashing out in court proceedings, committed with no other intention except to bring the Judiciary or prosecution into disrepute, simply cannot be a proper exercise of one's freedom of expression.\"",
            "I fully echo the views of the Director of Public Prosecutions",
            "A respect for the rule of law includes a respect for the judicial process",
            "When our prosecutors conduct cases in court, they are performing the constitutional duty of criminal prosecution in an apolitical manner",
            "The prosecutors, as part of the system of administration of justice, deserve respect instead of abuse.",
            "On 7 November, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), in exercise of its power under Article 158 of the Basic Law, pronounced an interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law (the Interpretation), which concerns the constitutional duty on the part of certain specified categories of public officials, when assuming office, to swear to uphold the Basic Law and to swear allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China.",
            "The making of the Interpretation has attracted much attention, both locally and internationally",
            "On my part, I am confident that the rule of law in Hong Kong does and will remain well and alive after the Interpretation",
            "The way in which our judges professionally handled the relevant legal proceedings during and subsequent to the making of the Interpretation proves my point beyond doubt.",
            "As I stressed earlier, deliberations on the rule of law should be objective and rational",
            "To properly consider the role of Article 158 of the Basic Law, it is worth highlighting the following observations made by Sir Anthony Mason, a leading jurist in the common law world and formerly a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal:",
            "\"The conjunction of a common law system under a national law within the larger framework of Chinese constitutional law is a fundamental aspect of the principle 'one country, two systems'",
            "Article 158 is the link between the two systems",
            "It draws a distinction between the power of final interpretation which is vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC ..",
            "and the power of final adjudication which is vested in the CFA.\" (Note 6)",
            "\"Despite the tensions which it may generate from time to time, art 158 is an ingenious link between the two legal systems",
            "Whether it is viewed from a constitutional, legal or political perspective, art 158 is central to the Hong Kong conception of the rule of law",
            "Debate about the rule of law in Hong Kong must recognise and proceed from the centrality of art 158",
            "In the words of Professor Vernon Bogdanor, '[f]or believers in the rule of law ..",
            "power should lie ..",
            "with the constitution'.\" (Note 7)",
            "For future purposes, may I also venture to suggest that matters that can be properly handled within Hong Kong's legal or judicial system should be left to be dealt with at the Hong Kong level as much as possible",
            "Such an approach is certainly not a disrespect to the NPCSC's constitutional jurisdiction to make interpretation pursuant to Article 158 of the Basic Law",
            "Instead, it is the best way to demonstrate that the \"one country, two systems\" policy does work robustly and successfully, and that the institutions devised under the Basic Law, including the judicial system, possess the quality and competence to meet such challenges as they arise.",
            "The last topic that I wish to touch on relates to our policy in promoting Hong Kong as a leading centre for legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "The Department of Justice is pushing for the introduction of two sets of amendments to the Arbitration Ordinance",
            "The first will clarify the law on the arbitrability of intellectual property disputes",
            "The second will allow third party funding of arbitration or mediation",
            "In addition, we are seeking to introduce an apology legislation, which will clarify the legal consequences of making an apology, so as to enhance the chances of reaching amicable settlement (whether in the course of mediation or otherwise)",
            "As and when these legislative works are completed, the legal framework of Hong Kong concerning dispute resolution will stay in the forefront of international development.",
            "The other latest development concerns our home-grown Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC), which has established itself as one of the leading arbitration institutes both internationally and within the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "Previously there was a plan to move the HKIAC from its current premises at Exchange Square II to the future legal hub which comprises the three blocks at the Justice Place and the former French Mission Building nearby",
            "Having considered the views of the international arbitration community (including the survey results of the Global Arbitration Review which gave top rankings to the HKIAC's facilities at the Exchange Square II premises) and the request of HKIAC, I am glad to announce that the Government has decided that HKIAC will continue to stay at its current premises",
            "Not only would this enable the HKIAC to maintain its competitive edge, we would also have more space at the future legal hub to house more internationally reputable legal or dispute resolution organisations.",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, this Opening of the Legal Year is the last one witnessed by this term of the Hong Kong SAR Government",
            "I am deeply honoured to have the opportunity to serve as the Secretary for Justice during such a challenging time of Hong Kong",
            "May I take this opportunity to express my utmost gratitude to all those who have contributed to the maintenance of the rule of law in Hong Kong, including members of the Judiciary and the two branches of the legal profession",
            "My thanks also go to all my colleagues in the Department of Justice (lawyers or otherwise)",
            "Many of them are, in my view, the unsung heroes in our efforts to safeguard the rule of law.",
            "On this note, it remains for me to wish all of you and the Hong Kong SAR a fruitful 2017.",

            "終審法院首席法官、各位司法機構人員、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：",
            "首先，我謹代表律政司歡迎各位嘉賓，特別是來自其他司法管轄區的嘉賓",
            "當這典禮在一九八○年恢復舉辦時，當時的首席按察司羅弼時爵士解釋，舉辦法律年度開啟典禮有三個理由（註一）",
            "其中一個理由是為了讓公眾聚焦法院及法律界的事宜，並加強他們對司法制度的認識",
            "雖然時移勢易，上述理由仍然適用",
            "首先，當我們的社會隨着發展變得複雜，社會上不同利益可能不時會出現衝突，而法治則是守護和平衡不同利益的最終制度",
            "第二，隨着更好的教育及資訊自由（特別是社交媒體和互聯網的普及使用），公眾人士更明白其權利及更積極參與有關法律議題的討論",
            "有時候，討論變得兩極化和政治化",
            "第三，由於「一國兩制」是個嶄新概念，在落實《基本法》時出現意見分歧是自然不過的事",
            "上述發展令在現今年代就法治這概念締造恰當的理解比從前更為重要",
            "在這方面，包括法律界的持份者做了大量工作",
            "然而，有些跡象卻教人憂慮",
            "也許我可先引述終審法院常任法官霍兆剛最近一篇演說的相關部分（註二）：",
            "「25.雖然這現象不是本司法管轄區獨有，在香港有一趨勢，訴訟當事人往往口號式地借用『法治』一詞",
            "因此，在一些司法覆核案件，聲稱一個決定或一政府部門的行為違反法治並非聞所未聞",
            "在其他案件中，雙方均指法院的裁決若對他們不利，則是不符合法治",
            "該案需決定誰在二○○○年的總統大選勝出，而雙方亦以法治為其理據",
            "兵咸勳爵引述一名學者的評論指出，『採取這魔法詞彙 （magic words，即「法治」）已普遍被視為與為一方歡呼做勢無異』",
            "26.在香港的媒體，有不少文章論述二○一四年『佔領』事件的檢控",
            "部分支持當中結果，部分則作批評",
            "不同人士當然會有不同觀點",
            "但當看到評論員只因他不同意某個結果，便指該結果符合或不符合法治……確實令人沮喪",
            "如斯評論每每向讀者灌輸法治的錯誤印象",
            "27.倘若這些印象開始生根，必定會對法治造成損害……」",
            "有的時候，社會上部分人士（包括曾受法律培訓的人士）為了增加政治籌碼，不時以法治作為口號",
            "這情況確實不幸",
            "恰當的刑事檢控有時被這些人士批評，只因他們支持被告的政治立場，而完全罔顧證據及法院的判決",
            "同樣地，執行《基本法》下的莊嚴責任，則被形容為政府漠視民主，尤如選民的支持可化作無視法定要求的盾牌",
            "當然，維護法治必須時刻警惕，政府的行為亦必須受到監察和批評",
            "但漠視法律責任，以及不恰當的政治化批評，無疑與法治背道而馳",
            "同樣道理，我們亦須避免就司法判決作政治化或不恰當的批評",
            "前終審法院首席法官李國能曾解述（註三）：",
            "「公眾往往會評論法庭的裁決，這是理所當然的",
            "在一個自由的社會裡，仔細評議法庭的判決，是憲法賦予的權利，人民理當積極行使",
            "再者，公開討論法庭的裁決，有助公眾人士進一步了解司法制度的運作和所討論事情的核心",
            "可是，就維持司法獨立而言，法官不應亦不能在政治舞台上替自己的判決辯護",
            "因此，人民行使對法庭的判決進行評議的權利時，必須是負責任的」",
            "李國能法官以上解述的關鍵詞為「負責任」",
            "除非討論是客觀及理性地進行，否則不可能視作「負責任」",
            "要達致這目標，不應單以一己的政治信念作為評核司法判決結果的準則",
            "反之，焦點應放在判詞中列舉的理據",
            "除了公開公義和程序公義，司法理據是普通法的基石",
            "因此，與其以非法律（例如政治）理由去攻擊法院判決，應嘗試探究和理解判詞中的理據",
            "不幸地，部分人士不時超越界線",
            "有的質疑法官的判決是否受其政治偏見所影響；亦有以粗言穢語對法官作毫無根據的人身攻擊",
            "更有甚者，有人向法官或其他執行法律的人士寄送具威嚇性物品",
            "所有此類不當行為必須遏止",
            "若司法機關得不到公眾敬重……法治的根基也會隨之而受損害」",
            "在我們的社會，公共事務的討論變得兩極化和政治化已成為趨勢",
            "箇中成因繁多，而達致良好管治，政府責無旁貸",
            "然而，為了香港的利益，必須全力防止這趨勢侵腐法治的基礎",
            "在這方面，我須補充另一觀點",
            "刑事檢控專員最近撰寫二○一五年刑事檢控科工作回顧時指出（註五）：",
            "「……對於有同事在出庭檢控，特別是在處理一些被視為政治敏感的案件時遭某些市民無理、惡意、不公的謾駡的事件有所增加，我實在感到痛心",
            "我們不可忘記，純粹為了侮辱司法機構或檢控機關，而在法院程序進行期間破口大駡，絕不能稱為言論自由的恰當行使」",
            "我完全認同刑事檢控專員的意見",
            "尊重法治包含尊重司法程序",
            "當檢控人員出庭處理案件時，他們是以政治中立的態度履行刑事檢控的憲制責任",

            "二○一六年十一月七日，全國人民代表大會常務委員會（全國人大常委會）行使《基本法》第一百五十八條賦予的權力，就《基本法》第一百零四條作出解釋（釋法）",

            "就我而言，我有信心香港的法治仍然會在釋法後屹立不倒",
            "觀乎法官如何專業地處理釋法期間和其後的相關案件，已能毫無疑問地證實此論點",
            "正如我早前強調，有關法治的討論必須客觀和理性",
            "要恰當地考慮《基本法》第一百五十八條的角色，值得重溫普通法世界的著名法學家及前終審法院非常任法官梅師賢爵士以下的解述：",
            "「『一國兩制』原則的一個根本特點，是在中國憲法框架下的全國性法律融入普通法制度",
            "第一百五十八條是兩個制度的連結",
            "它區分了全國人民代表大會常務委員會的最終解釋權……和終審法院的終審權",
            "」（註六）「雖然它可能偶爾衍生緊張情況，第一百五十八條是兩個法律制度之間的巧妙連結",
            "無論是從憲制、法律或政治角度而言，第一百五十八條是香港法治的中心",
            "討論香港法治，必須認同第一百五十八條，並以其為中軸",
            "套用Vernon Bogdanor教授的說法：『對相信法治的人而言……權力源自憲法……』」（註七）",
            "我亦希望指出一個觀點，為未來提供參考",
            "若能在香港的法律或司法制度內解決的事宜，應盡量在香港層面處理",
            "這方式並不代表不尊重全國人大常委會根據《基本法》第一百五十八條享有的解釋權，而是證明「一國兩制」政策能有效和成功地落實，以及《基本法》下設定的機制（包括司法制度），具有質素和能力駕馭挑戰的最佳方式",
            "我最後希望一談的議題涉及我們推廣香港作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決中心的政策",
            "律政司正積極引進就《仲裁條例》的兩項修改",
            "其一旨在澄清知識產權爭議的可仲裁性，其二則容許第三者資助仲裁或調解",
            "再者，我們亦希望引入道歉法例，從而澄清道歉的法律後果，增加（在調解期間或其他情況）達成和解的機會",
            "當相關立法工作完成後，香港在爭議解決方面的法律框架將繼續維持在國際發展的前端",
            "另一最新發展關乎在本地成立，並已在亞太區及國際間享有領導地位的香港國際仲裁中心",
            "早前有計劃將該中心從其現址，即交易廣場二期，遷移到由律政中心三座大樓和毗鄰的前法國外方傳道大樓組成的「法律樞紐」",
            "在考慮國際仲裁社會的意見（包括《環球仲裁評論》（Global Arbitration Review）的調查結果給予該中心於交易廣場的設施之極高評價），以及該中心的要求，我很高興向大家宣布，政府已決定香港國際仲裁中心將繼續留於現址",
            "此舉不但能令該中心維持其競爭力，亦同時令「法律樞紐」能騰出更多空間去迎接更多國際知名的法律或爭議解決機構",
