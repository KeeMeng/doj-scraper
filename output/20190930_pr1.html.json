            "A spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) said that the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will come into operation tomorrow (October 1).",
            "\"Currently Mainland laws do not allow parties to arbitral proceedings in other jurisdictions to apply to a people's court in the Mainland for interim measures. After the Arrangement takes effect, parties to arbitral proceedings which are seated in Hong Kong and administered by designated arbitral institutions would be able to seek assistance from the relevant people's courts in the Mainland. The implementation of the Arrangement would enhance the competitiveness of our international arbitration services,\" the spokesman added.",
            "A seminar on the Arrangement, co-organised by the DoJ and the Supreme People's Court, will be held on October 19. Details can be found at the following website: www.hkiac.org/events/seminar-arrangement-concerning-mutual-assistance-court-ordered-interim-measures-aid-arbitral.",
