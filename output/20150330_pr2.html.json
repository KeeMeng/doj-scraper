            "In response to media enquiries concerning recent comments made by certain sectors of the public in respect of the Judiciary, a spokesman for the Department of Justice responded as follows this evening (March 30):",
            "1. Judicial independence is of fundamental importance to Hong Kong. Judges only decide cases according to the relevant evidence and the applicable law.",
            "2. The spokesman repeated the following remarks made by the Secretary for Justice at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2014 on January 13, 2014 (paragraphs seven to nine):",
            "\"Controversial decisions, such as cases concerning the rights guaranteed under the Basic Law or those concerning environmental protection, often attracted media attention or even generated heated discussion. This is totally understandable. The freedom of the press and the freedom of expression must allow appropriate and good faith discussion of decisions made by judges. As Lord Atkin once remarked (Note 1), 'Justice is not a cloistered virtue: she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and the respectful even though outspoken comments of ordinary men.'",
            "However, appropriate discussion or even criticism of judicial decisions is one thing, abusive attacks and unwarranted conduct which would undermine the independence of the judiciary and public confidence in the administration of justice are totally different. As Sir Anthony Mason observed (Note 2) the courts 'should not be made a target of irresponsible criticism. Public confidence, which is vital to the well-being of the administration of justice, once lost or damaged, is not easily restored.'",
            "Similarly, Sir Sydney Kentridge, QC, pointed out as follows (Note 3):",
            "'... Independence here means more than independence from government direction. It means also that judges in making their decisions should as far as humanly possible not be influenced by public opinion, or by any sense of obligation to the government or to any individual, party, or pressure group. There is a particular threat to judicial independence which should concern us: that is, the growing tendency for politicians and the press to attack in intemperate and even vituperative terms judges who have given decisions with which they disagree.",
            "'Judges, it has also been said, must have broad backs, and usually they have. The real mischief of unwarranted attacks on the motives and integrity of the judges, however, is not any hurt to the judge's feelings; it is that they undermine that respect for the judiciary without which, ... the foundations of the rule of law are undermined.'\"",
            "3. The Secretary for Justice invited the community to take note of the above position and not to take any step which may constitute contempt of court or other criminal offences, or otherwise may prejudice judicial independence. Where necessary, the Department of Justice will not hesitate to take appropriate actions.",

            "回應傳媒查詢有關部分社會人士最近對司法機構的評論，律政司發言人今日（三月三十日）傍晚表示︰",

            "（二）發言人重申律政司司長在二○一四年一月十三日的二○一四年法律年度開啟典禮上的相關致辭（第七至九段）：",
            "「諸如涉及《基本法》賦與的權利或環保議題等案件，很多具爭議性的判決往往引起傳媒關注，甚或引發激烈辯論。此種情況完全可以理解。新聞自由和言論自由必須容許就法庭的判決進行恰當和真誠討論。正如艾特大法官曾指出（註一），『公義並非與世隔絕的美德，她必須經得起監察及一般人敬重但敢言的批評』。",
            "然而，就法庭判決作恰當的討論甚或批評是一回事，但辱罵性的攻擊，或會削弱司法獨立和公眾對司法制度的信心的不當行為則完全是另一回事。正如梅師賢爵士指出（註二），法庭『不應成為不負責任批評的目標。公眾信心對保持司法制度的健全性極為重要，一旦消失或受損害則往往不能輕易修補』。",
            "同樣地，Sydney Kentridge爵士指出（註三）：",
            "『……獨立在此範疇不單意味獨立於政府指示，亦意味在盡可能的情況下，法官判案時不應受公眾輿論、或政府及任何個人、黨派或壓力團體所影響。其中對司法獨立特別構成威脅的一個趨勢，是政客及傳媒往往因法官作出他們不同意的判決，而放縱地斥責法官。",
            "有云法官應有廣闊的肩膀，而事實上法官亦一般如是。但就法官的意圖和誠信作出不恰當的攻擊，其真正損害不在於法官的感受，而在於削弱公眾對司法機構的尊重。若司法機構得不到公眾敬重，法治的根基也會隨之而受損害。』」",
            "（三）律政司司長希望社會人士留意以上立場，並且不要作出任何可能構成藐視法庭、其他刑事罪行或損害司法獨立的行為。有需要時，律政司會毫不猶豫採取適當行動。",
