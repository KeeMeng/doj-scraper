            "The setting up of the new Asia Pacific Regional Office (Regional Office) of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (Hague Conference) in Hong Kong not only marks a new chapter for the Hague Conference but also constitutes a significant vote of confidence in Hong Kong's position both as a regional legal services centre and as a springboard for the Hague Conference to further develop its work and extend its influence in the region, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said today (December 13).",
            "Mr Yuen was speaking at the opening ceremony of the Regional Office held at Government House this afternoon.",
            "He said that with the strong support from the Central People's Government (CPG), the Council on General Affairs and Policy of the Hague Conference decided in April this year to set up its second regional office in Hong Kong, in addition to its Latin American regional office in Buenos Aires.",
            "\"The Hague Conventions stand out as shining examples of a pool of international instruments, in the field of private international law on various subject matters, which may be conveniently tapped into by any state in the region. Many of these instruments have been tested by time and actual cases, and we can testify that they have served Hong Kong very well over the years,\" Mr Yuen said.",
            "At the ceremony today, the Chief Executive, Mr C Y Leung, witnessed the signing of the Host Country Agreement and the Memorandum ofAdministrative Arrangements relating to the establishment of the Regional Office. The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the CPG, Mr Cui Tiankai, represented the CPG to sign the Host Country Agreement, while Mr Yuen represented the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)Government to sign the Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements with the Secretary General of the Hague Conference, Mr Hans van Loon.",
            "Mr Cui said that establishing the Regional Office in Hong Kong was an important strategic decision by the Hague Conference on its long-term development.",
            "\"Relying on the advantages of Hong Kong, a vibrant international city where the Eastern culture meets Western culture, I trust that the Regional Office will surely meet people's expectations. It will be a gateway for the Hague Conference to extend its influence and serve as a platform for further co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region. China will, as before, actively participate in its activities and give strong support to the work of the Regional Office,\" Mr Cui said.",
            "Speaking at the ceremony, Mr van Loon expressed his gratitude to the CPG and the HKSAR Government for their support in setting up the Regional Office.",
            "He said that the new office would serve as a base of operations to publicise the Hague Conventions, which have been proved to be adaptable to the needs of different regions and provide a connection to the global community.",
            "\"The task of the Hague Conference on Private International Law is to develop and service such multilateral legal instruments, Conventions, which, despite the differences between legal systems, will allow individuals as well as companies to enjoy a high degree of legal security. For this reason, I am certain that the new Asia Pacific Regional Office here in Hong Kong will be a tremendous asset for years to come,\" he said.",
            "The office is the second regional office of the Hague Conference and the first in the region. Initially it comprises a Representative, an office manager and legal officers seconded by the Member States of the Hague Conference.",
            "The Honourable Mr Justice Hartmann will be the first Representative of the Hague Conference for the Asia Pacific region.",
            "The Hague Conference is a leading global intergovernmentalorganisation in the field of private international law. It develops and services multilateral legal instruments on private international law, commonly known as the Hague Conventions, which respond to global needs. There are now over 130 countries that are party to one or more of the Hague Conventions.",
            "In addition to its statutory mission for progressive unification of private international law rules ranging from commercial law and banking law to international civil procedure and from child protection to matters of marriage and personal status, it also fosters international judicial and administrative co-operation in the area of private law, especially in the fields of protection of the family and children, of civil procedure and commercial law. China is a member of the Hague Conference and representatives from the HKSAR participate in the work of the Hague Conference as members of the Chinese delegation.",

            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（十二月十三日）表示，在香港設立海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）亞太區域辦事處（區域辦事處），不但為海牙會議的工作揭開新一頁，也標誌着海牙會議對香港作為區域法律服務中心及作為海牙會議在區內推行工作和發揮影響力的跳板，投下重要信心的一票。",
            "袁國強在禮賓府舉行的區域辦事處開幕儀式上致辭時作上述表示。",
            "他表示，在中央人民政府大力支持下，海牙會議常務和政策大會於今年四月決定在香港成立區域辦事處，這是海牙會議繼布宜諾斯艾利斯的拉丁美洲辦事處後所設的第二個區域辦事處。",
            "袁國強說︰「在國際私法的各項事宜，《海牙公約》是眾多國際文書的卓越典範，可供區內國家隨時採用，當中不少文書已經過時間和實際案件的考驗。我們可以證實，這些國際文書多年來在香港發揮了重大的作用。」",
            "在開幕儀式上，行政長官梁振英見證了為成立區域辦事處而進行的東道國協議和行政安排備忘錄的簽署儀式。外交部副部長崔天凱代表中央人民政府簽署東道國協議，而袁國強則代表香港特區政府與海牙會議秘書長漢斯．范魯簽署行政安排備忘錄。",
            "崔天凱表示，在香港設立區域辦事處，是海牙會議着眼於今後長遠發展的重要戰略決策。",
            "他說︰「借助香港這個融匯東西文化、充滿活力和魅力的國際化大都會，相信辦事處一定會不負眾望，成為海牙會議在亞太區域擴大影響的窗口，促進合作的平台。中國將一如既往地積極參與海牙會議的活動，並大力支持辦事處的工作。」",
            "漢斯．范魯在開幕典禮上感謝中央人民政府及香港特區政府支持成立區域辦事處。",
            "他表示新辦事處將會成為推廣《海牙公約》的基地。《海牙公約》已證明可以適應各地區的需要，為全球社會提供連繫。",
            "他說：「海牙會議的工作是發展和服務多邊法律文書和公約，儘管在不同的法律制度下，個人和公司均能享有高度的法律保障。因此，我肯定在香港新設的區域辦事處將是未來的重要資產。」",
            "該辦事處是海牙會議的第二所區域辦事處，也是區內的首間辦事處。辦事處初期人員包括一名辦事處代表、辦公室經理和從海牙會議成員國借調的法律人員。",
            "區域辦事處的首位辦事處代表是夏正民法官。 海牙會議是國際私法界中主要的全球性政府間組織，致力發展和提供多邊的國際私法工具（一般稱為《海牙公約》），應付全球需要。目前全球有超過一百三十個國家屬一項或多項《海牙公約》的成員。",
            "除了要履行逐步統一國際私法規則的法定任務外（這包括商業法律、銀行法律和國際民事程序，亦涵蓋兒童保護、婚姻和個人地位的事宜），海牙會議亦推動私法領域的國際司法和行政合作，特別是在家庭和兒童保障，以及民事程序和商事法律的範疇上。中國是海牙會議的成員國，香港特別行政區的代表則以中國代表團成員的身分，參與海牙會議的工作。",
