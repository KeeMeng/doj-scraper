            "Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (June 6):",
            "Question:",
            "It has been reported that four alleged incidents of clandestine video-recording and photo-taking in courtrooms occurred in the past three months. Three of such incidents occurred during the trial of cases of the offences of riot, etc. committed in Mong Kok, and the latest one occurred during the trial of contempt of court case relating to the Occupy Mong Kok movement in 2014. On February 23, a man pointed his mobile phone to the direction of the jury and took photos and videos, and disseminated the photos and video clips through an instant messaging software. However, the judge who tried the case decided not to pursue the matter after the man deleted the photos and video clips. On May 18, when the jurors of that case retired for deliberation, the Judiciary received an email with words which read \"there are a lot more\" and with a photo with features of the jurors. Some members of the legal profession have considered that the person who sent the email attempted to challenge the court’s impartiality in the trial of the case. On the other hand, it has been reported that in an article entitled \"Smart tips to observe trials in High Court\" posted on a Mainland website with a number of photos featuring local courts, the author said that, \"fortunately, the clandestine photo-taking was not discovered by the judge\". Also, an article entitled \"What kind of experience is it to observe trials in Hong Kong’s High Court\", along with photos of local courts, can be found through a Mainland Internet search engine. Those articles show that the courts in Hong Kong seem to have become a tourist attraction for Mainland tourists. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it has assessed if the aforesaid acts of clandestine video-recording and photo-taking, as pointed out by the media, relate to politically sensitive cases, and whether such incidents (i) involved the intention of some people to influence the trials by sending out threatening messages, (ii) will cause members of the public who serve as jurors to worry about their identities being exposed and their personal safety, and (iii) has an impact on the confidence of members of the public on the court's impartiality in trying cases;",
            "(2) whether it will seriously pursue the criminal liability of the aforesaid persons involved in the clandestine video-recording and photo-taking;",
            "(3) whether it knows if the Judiciary has stepped up measures to prevent the recurrence of incidents of clandestine video-recording and photo-taking of the jury in court to ensure that they discharge their duties impartially without worries and free from threats; and",
            "(4) whether it will request the relevant Mainland authorities to (i) address squarely the aforesaid issues and (ii) step up education of Mainland residents of their obligation to abide by the laws of Hong Kong, including the requirement that no video-recording and photo-taking is allowed when observing trials in court, when they are in Hong Kong?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Trial by jury for criminal cases at the Court of First Instance (CFI) is an indispensable component of the criminal justice system and a deep-rooted aspect of the common law tradition of Hong Kong. Article 86 of the Basic Law provides that \"the principle of trial by jury previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained.\"",
            "In HKSAR v Lee Ming-tee and another (2001) 4 HKCFAR 133 (FACC No. 8 of 2000), the Court of Final Appeal pointed out in its judgment that \"reliance on the integrity of the jury and its ability to try the case fairly on the evidence, to put aside extraneous prejudice and to follow the directions of the judge is fundamental to the jury system itself.\"",
            "Any intended or actual threat that constitutes undue pressure on jurors and judicial officers resulting in biased acts on their parts is completely unacceptable. Such acts may not only bring about injustice to the defendants in certain cases, but also weaken public confidence in the jury system and the criminal justice system.",
            "In a recent case of criminal contempt of court handled by the CFI of the High Court involving photo-taking in court, the defendant was convicted by the Court for criminal contempt of court. In the reasons for verdict and sentence, the Court clearly pointed out that photo-taking in court would very likely prejudice or interfere with the due administration of justice. This is because photo-taking in the courtroom would possibly disrupt or interrupt court proceedings. Moreover, photo-taking may cause concern or unease among jurors and witnesses (including victims in sexual assault cases), in particular when their identities are disclosed, thereby leading to issues of their safety. If the photographs are misused, it will deal an even more serious blow to the due administration of justice. Therefore, photo-taking in court would very likely constitute the offence of criminal contempt of court.",
            "Under existing laws, there are generally two ways to deal with the acts of taking photographs in court:",
            "(i) Under section 7 of the Summary Offences Ordinance (Cap. 228), certain acts of taking photographs in court are prohibited. Offenders are liable to a fine of $2,000 upon conviction.",
            "(ii) Suspected offenders may also be prosecuted for criminal contempt of court, and could be sentenced to a fine and imprisonment upon conviction.",
            "In a most recent case involving clandestine photo-taking during court proceedings in the CFI referred above, the trial judge has taken forward proceedings for contempt of court according to summary procedures in respect of the act of clandestine photo-taking by the offender. The offender was ultimately convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for seven days. As regards another incident involving clandestine photo-taking of jurors during a trial at the CFI, the Police have launched investigation into the case. The Department of Justice (DoJ) will take a serious approach in following up on the case, and on receipt of the Police's investigation report and evidence gathered, it will consider, in accordance with the Prosecution Code and the applicable law, whether to initiate prosecution or proceedings for committal for contempt of court.",
            "In respect of the question raised by the Hon Paul Tse, the DoJ has consulted the Judiciary Administration, whose response to part (3) of the question is as follows:",
            "\"The Judiciary takes the view that due administration of justice is of paramount importance for all court proceedings. In particular, trial by jury is an important part of the administration of justice under the common law, which is constitutionally protected under Article 86 of the Basic Law. Serving jurors must be free from all actual or perceived interference or pressure. An important safeguard is the prohibition of photography and audio or video recording inside courtrooms.",
            "According to the Judiciary, the Judiciary has all along been taking measures to remind court users that photo-taking is not allowed in courtrooms. For example, clear signage is posted inside courtrooms and at court lobbies. The Judiciary staff has been reminding court users of such restriction as necessary. The Judiciary has also been referring cases involving photo-taking at court buildings to the DoJ and/or Police for follow-up actions as appropriate.",
            "The Judiciary is very concerned with the recent incidents of photo-taking in courtrooms when proceedings were held and takes the matter seriously. Besides taking the necessary follow-up actions, the Judiciary has recently put in place the following enhancement measures:",
            "(i) making public announcements in courtrooms before commencement of court proceedings to remind court users of the photo-taking prohibition. The announcements are made in Cantonese, English and Putonghua;",
            "(ii) putting up more notices and signage on the prohibition of photo-taking in more prominent areas in courtrooms and at court lobbies;",
            "(iii) reminding court users of the prohibition of photo-taking more extensively by Judiciary staff verbally or through written notices as appropriate; and",
            "(iv) strengthening security personnel manpower during court proceedings for monitoring the situation as necessary.",
            "In addition, the Judiciary is actively considering the issuance of a Practice Direction to regulate the use of mobile phones and other devices with photo-taking or audio/video recording capability for jury proceedings.\"",
            "As regards parts (1), (2) and (4) of the Hon Paul Tse's question, the DoJ's response is as follows:",
            "(1) and (2) We do not provide specific comments on individual cases. In respect of the incident of clandestine photo-taking of jurors referred above, it is already under police investigation. The DoJ attaches great importance to the incident. But to avoid affecting the related follow-up actions, it is inappropriate for us to comment any further or disclose any specific details at this stage. On receipt of the Police's investigation report and evidence gathered, the DoJ will make an independent professional consideration as to whether to initiate prosecution or proceedings for committal for contempt of court in accordance with the Prosecution Code and the applicable law, and the offender may also be subject to arrest or punishment. In the most recent case involving clandestine photo-taking during court proceedings in the CFI referred above, the trial judge emphasised in his judgment that the court must protect the privacy and safety of jurors and witnesses, so that they would not be subject to unnecessary interference. And because photographs taken inside the court may also be disseminated quickly and fall into the hands of the bad elements, thereby seriously disrupting the court's judicial proceedings, it is necessary to impose penalties with deterrent effect on offenders for illegal photo-taking in court.",
            "(4) Taking into account the various measures set out in the Judiciary's response to part (3) of the question set out above, it is considered that there are sufficient measures to ensure that people observing trials in court are aware of the requirement that photo-taking is not allowed in court. The sentence imposed in the most recent case involving clandestine photo-taking during court proceedings in the CFI has also sent a clear and deterring signal to the public, the court definitely would not tolerate acts of illegal photo-taking in court.",

            "以下是今日（六月六日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "據報，過去三個月發生四宗涉嫌法庭內偷拍事件。當中三宗發生於在旺角發生的暴動等罪案審訊期間，而最近一宗發生於一宗二○一四年佔領旺角行動中藐視法庭的案件審訊期間。二月二十三日，一名男子用手機向陪審團方向拍照和錄影，並將照片和錄影片段透過即時通訊軟件傳播。惟該男子刪除照片和錄影片段後，審理該案件的法官決定不作追究。五月十八日，在該宗案件的陪審員退席商議期間，司法機構收到附有陪審員容貌的電郵，並載有「還有很多」的字句。有法律界人士認為，寄出該電郵的人意圖挑戰法庭公正審理案件。另一方面，據報一個內地網站載有一篇題為《高院旁聽攻略》及附有多張本地法庭照片的文章，作者於文章中表示「幸好沒給法官發現偷拍」，而且透過一個內地互聯網搜尋引擎可搜尋到一篇附有本地法庭照片、題為《香港高等法院旁聽是一種怎樣的體驗》的文章。該等文章顯示香港的法院似乎已成為內地旅客的遊覽勝地。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）有否評估上述偷錄及偷拍照片行為，是否如傳媒所指，關乎敏感政治案件，以及該等事件（i）是否涉及有人想發出威嚇信息，從而左右審訊、（ii）會否令出任陪審員的市民擔心身份曝光及人身安全，以及（iii）有否衝擊市民對法庭公正審理案件的信心；",
            "（二）會否嚴肅追究上述偷錄及偷拍照片人士的刑事責任；",
            "（三）是否知悉司法機構有否加強措施，防止再有在法庭內偷錄及偷拍陪審團的事件，確保他們在沒有顧慮、不受威脅的情況下，公正地履行責任；及",
            "（四）會否要求內地有關當局（i）正視上述問題，以及（ii）加強教育內地居民在港時須遵守香港的法律，包括到法庭旁聽時不可攝錄及拍照的規定？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "原訟法庭在刑事案件採用陪審團審訊，是刑事司法制度不可或缺的組成部分，亦是本港普通法傳統中根深蒂固的一環。《基本法》第86條訂明，「原在香港實行的陪審制度的原則予以保留。」",
            "終審法院在香港特別行政區訴李明治及另一人（2001） 4 HKCFAR 133 （終院刑事上訴2000年第8號）判案書指出，「陪審團制度本身的根基，在於可信賴陪審團持正地行事以及有能力公平地根據證據審訊案件，丟開外在的偏見和遵從法官的指示行事。」",
            "任何意圖或有實質風險會對陪審員及司法人員構成不當壓力以致他們產生偏頗的行為，均絕對不能接受。這些行為，除了可能對某些案件中的被告人造成不公，更有可能削弱公眾對陪審團制度和刑事司法制度的信心。",
            "最近在高等法院原訟法庭處理一宗涉及在法庭內偷拍的刑事藐視法庭的案件中，法庭裁決被告人干犯藐視法庭罪。在該案件的裁決理由中，法庭清楚指出在法庭內進行拍照很可能對司法公正構成損害或干擾。這是由於在法庭內進行拍照或會擾亂法律程序或導致程序中斷。再者，拍攝的照片會令陪審員和證人（包括性侵犯案件的受害者）感到不安及擔心，尤其是當他們的身份被披露，會引致人身安全等問題。若拍攝的照片被不當地使用，對司法公正會構成更嚴重的損害。因此，在法庭進行拍照很可能構成刑事藐視法庭罪。",
            "根據現行法律，針對在法庭內攝影的行為，大致有兩種處理方法：",
            "（i）《簡易程序治罪條例》（第228章）第7條禁止某些在法庭內攝影的行為，一經定罪，可判處罰款2,000元。",
            "（ii）涉嫌干犯者亦可被控以刑事藐視法庭罪，一經定罪，可判處罰款及監禁。",
            "上述最新近一宗在原訟法庭案件審訊中偷拍的事件，原審法官已循簡易程序就涉案人士的偷拍行為進行刑事藐視法庭的聆訊，最終裁定干犯者罪名成立並須監禁七日。而就另外一宗涉及在原訟法庭案件審訊中發生的陪審員被偷拍事件，警方已經展開調查。律政司會嚴肅跟進事件，在收到警方的調查報告及調查所得的證據後，會根據《檢控守則》和適用法律考慮是否就事件進行檢控或展開藐視法庭的交付羈押程序。",
            "律政司已經就謝偉俊議員的提問徵詢司法機構政務處。該處就問題第（三）部分的回覆如下：",
            "「司法機構認為，在所有法庭程序中妥善執行司法工作至為重要；尤其是在普通法下，屬司法工作重要一環的陪審團制度。此制度在憲法上受到《基本法》第86條保障。出任陪審員的人士必須不受任何實際的或他們認為存在的干預或壓力所影響。禁止在法庭內攝影及錄音或錄影是一項重要的保障措施。",
            "司法機構指出，司法機構一直採取措施以提醒法庭使用者在法庭內不准攝影。例如，在法庭內及法院大堂張貼清晰的標示；司法機構人員並會在有需要時提醒法庭使用者有關限制。一直以來，司法機構亦會在適當情況下將涉及於法院大樓攝影的案件轉介予律政司及／或警方以採取跟進行動。",
            "對於近日有人於法院程序進行期間在法庭內攝影的事件，司法機構表示非常關注，並以嚴肅態度對待。除了採取所需的跟進行動外，司法機構最近亦已實施以下加強措施：",
            "（i）於法庭程序開始前在法庭內作出公布，提醒法庭使用者有關禁止攝影的規定。公布以廣東話、英語及普通話作出；",
            "（ii）在法庭內及法院大堂多個更當眼處張貼更多有關禁止攝影的通告及標示；",
            "（iii）透過司法機構人員因應適當情況以口頭或書面告示的方式，更全面地提醒法庭使用者有關禁止攝影的規定；以及",
            "（iv）於法庭程序進行期間，在有需要時增派保安人員，以監察有關情況。",
            "此外，司法機構正積極考慮發出實務指示，對在有陪審團參與的法律程序中使用流動電話及其他有攝影或錄音／錄影功能的器材，作出規管。」",
            "至於謝偉俊議員所提問題的第（一）、（二）及（四）部分，律政司回覆如下：",
            "（一）及（二）我們不具體評論個別個案。就上文所提及的有關陪審員被偷拍事件，警方已經展開調查。律政司相當重視事件，但為免影響日後的相關跟進工作，律政司不宜作進一步評論，亦不宜在現階段透露具體詳情。律政司在收到警方的調查報告及調查所得的證據後，會根據《檢控守則》和適用法律獨立及專業地考慮是否就事件進行檢控或展開藐視法庭的交付羈押程序，而涉案人士亦可能因此而被拘捕及懲處。在上文所提及的最新近一宗在原訟法庭案件審訊中偷拍的案件，原審法官在判案時強調，法庭必須保護陪審員和證人的隱私及安全，以免他們受到不必要的干擾。而由於在法庭内拍攝的照片亦有可能被迅速散播及落入不法分子手中，嚴重影響法庭的司法程序，故必須對在法庭非法攝影的干犯者判處阻嚇性刑罰。",
            "（四）考慮到司法機構在回覆問題第（三）部分所提及的上述各項措施，現時已有足夠途徑讓到法庭旁聽人士知悉不可在法庭內攝影的規定。最新近一宗在原訟法庭案件審訊中偷拍的事件的判刑亦已向公眾發出明確而且具阻嚇性的信息，法庭絕對不會姑息在法庭内非法攝影的行為。",

            "(4) Taking into account the various measures set out in the Judiciary's response to part (3) of the question set out above, it is considered that there are sufficient measures to ensure that people observing trials in court are aware of the requirement that photo-taking is not allowed in court",
            "The sentence imposed in the most recent case involving clandestine photo-taking during court proceedings in the CFI has also sent a clear and deterring signal to the public, the court definitely would not tolerate acts of illegal photo-taking in court.",

            "以下是今日（六月六日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "據報，過去三個月發生四宗涉嫌法庭內偷拍事件",
            "當中三宗發生於在旺角發生的暴動等罪案審訊期間，而最近一宗發生於一宗二○一四年佔領旺角行動中藐視法庭的案件審訊期間",
            "二月二十三日，一名男子用手機向陪審團方向拍照和錄影，並將照片和錄影片段透過即時通訊軟件傳播",
            "惟該男子刪除照片和錄影片段後，審理該案件的法官決定不作追究",
            "五月十八日，在該宗案件的陪審員退席商議期間，司法機構收到附有陪審員容貌的電郵，並載有「還有很多」的字句",
            "有法律界人士認為，寄出該電郵的人意圖挑戰法庭公正審理案件",
            "另一方面，據報一個內地網站載有一篇題為《高院旁聽攻略》及附有多張本地法庭照片的文章，作者於文章中表示「幸好沒給法官發現偷拍」，而且透過一個內地互聯網搜尋引擎可搜尋到一篇附有本地法庭照片、題為《香港高等法院旁聽是一種怎樣的體驗》的文章",
            "該等文章顯示香港的法院似乎已成為內地旅客的遊覽勝地",
            "就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）有否評估上述偷錄及偷拍照片行為，是否如傳媒所指，關乎敏感政治案件，以及該等事件（i）是否涉及有人想發出威嚇信息，從而左右審訊、（ii）會否令出任陪審員的市民擔心身份曝光及人身安全，以及（iii）有否衝擊市民對法庭公正審理案件的信心；",
            "（二）會否嚴肅追究上述偷錄及偷拍照片人士的刑事責任；",
            "（三）是否知悉司法機構有否加強措施，防止再有在法庭內偷錄及偷拍陪審團的事件，確保他們在沒有顧慮、不受威脅的情況下，公正地履行責任；及",
            "（四）會否要求內地有關當局（i）正視上述問題，以及（ii）加強教育內地居民在港時須遵守香港的法律，包括到法庭旁聽時不可攝錄及拍照的規定？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "原訟法庭在刑事案件採用陪審團審訊，是刑事司法制度不可或缺的組成部分，亦是本港普通法傳統中根深蒂固的一環",
            "《基本法》第86條訂明，「原在香港實行的陪審制度的原則予以保留」",
            "終審法院在香港特別行政區訴李明治及另一人（2001） 4 HKCFAR 133 （終院刑事上訴2000年第8號）判案書指出，「陪審團制度本身的根基，在於可信賴陪審團持正地行事以及有能力公平地根據證據審訊案件，丟開外在的偏見和遵從法官的指示行事」",
            "任何意圖或有實質風險會對陪審員及司法人員構成不當壓力以致他們產生偏頗的行為，均絕對不能接受",
            "這些行為，除了可能對某些案件中的被告人造成不公，更有可能削弱公眾對陪審團制度和刑事司法制度的信心",
            "最近在高等法院原訟法庭處理一宗涉及在法庭內偷拍的刑事藐視法庭的案件中，法庭裁決被告人干犯藐視法庭罪",
            "在該案件的裁決理由中，法庭清楚指出在法庭內進行拍照很可能對司法公正構成損害或干擾",
            "這是由於在法庭內進行拍照或會擾亂法律程序或導致程序中斷",
            "再者，拍攝的照片會令陪審員和證人（包括性侵犯案件的受害者）感到不安及擔心，尤其是當他們的身份被披露，會引致人身安全等問題",
            "若拍攝的照片被不當地使用，對司法公正會構成更嚴重的損害",
            "因此，在法庭進行拍照很可能構成刑事藐視法庭罪",
            "根據現行法律，針對在法庭內攝影的行為，大致有兩種處理方法：",
            "（i）《簡易程序治罪條例》（第228章）第7條禁止某些在法庭內攝影的行為，一經定罪，可判處罰款2,000元",
            "（ii）涉嫌干犯者亦可被控以刑事藐視法庭罪，一經定罪，可判處罰款及監禁",
            "上述最新近一宗在原訟法庭案件審訊中偷拍的事件，原審法官已循簡易程序就涉案人士的偷拍行為進行刑事藐視法庭的聆訊，最終裁定干犯者罪名成立並須監禁七日",
            "而就另外一宗涉及在原訟法庭案件審訊中發生的陪審員被偷拍事件，警方已經展開調查",
            "律政司會嚴肅跟進事件，在收到警方的調查報告及調查所得的證據後，會根據《檢控守則》和適用法律考慮是否就事件進行檢控或展開藐視法庭的交付羈押程序",
            "律政司已經就謝偉俊議員的提問徵詢司法機構政務處",
            "該處就問題第（三）部分的回覆如下：",
            "「司法機構認為，在所有法庭程序中妥善執行司法工作至為重要；尤其是在普通法下，屬司法工作重要一環的陪審團制度",
            "此制度在憲法上受到《基本法》第86條保障",
            "出任陪審員的人士必須不受任何實際的或他們認為存在的干預或壓力所影響",
            "禁止在法庭內攝影及錄音或錄影是一項重要的保障措施",
            "司法機構指出，司法機構一直採取措施以提醒法庭使用者在法庭內不准攝影",
            "例如，在法庭內及法院大堂張貼清晰的標示；司法機構人員並會在有需要時提醒法庭使用者有關限制",
            "一直以來，司法機構亦會在適當情況下將涉及於法院大樓攝影的案件轉介予律政司及／或警方以採取跟進行動",
            "對於近日有人於法院程序進行期間在法庭內攝影的事件，司法機構表示非常關注，並以嚴肅態度對待",
            "除了採取所需的跟進行動外，司法機構最近亦已實施以下加強措施：",
            "（i）於法庭程序開始前在法庭內作出公布，提醒法庭使用者有關禁止攝影的規定",
            "公布以廣東話、英語及普通話作出；",
            "（ii）在法庭內及法院大堂多個更當眼處張貼更多有關禁止攝影的通告及標示；",
            "（iii）透過司法機構人員因應適當情況以口頭或書面告示的方式，更全面地提醒法庭使用者有關禁止攝影的規定；以及",
            "（iv）於法庭程序進行期間，在有需要時增派保安人員，以監察有關情況",
            "此外，司法機構正積極考慮發出實務指示，對在有陪審團參與的法律程序中使用流動電話及其他有攝影或錄音／錄影功能的器材，作出規管」",
            "至於謝偉俊議員所提問題的第（一）、（二）及（四）部分，律政司回覆如下：",
            "（一）及（二）我們不具體評論個別個案",
            "就上文所提及的有關陪審員被偷拍事件，警方已經展開調查",
            "律政司相當重視事件，但為免影響日後的相關跟進工作，律政司不宜作進一步評論，亦不宜在現階段透露具體詳情",
            "律政司在收到警方的調查報告及調查所得的證據後，會根據《檢控守則》和適用法律獨立及專業地考慮是否就事件進行檢控或展開藐視法庭的交付羈押程序，而涉案人士亦可能因此而被拘捕及懲處",
            "在上文所提及的最新近一宗在原訟法庭案件審訊中偷拍的案件，原審法官在判案時強調，法庭必須保護陪審員和證人的隱私及安全，以免他們受到不必要的干擾",
            "而由於在法庭内拍攝的照片亦有可能被迅速散播及落入不法分子手中，嚴重影響法庭的司法程序，故必須對在法庭非法攝影的干犯者判處阻嚇性刑罰",
            "（四）考慮到司法機構在回覆問題第（三）部分所提及的上述各項措施，現時已有足夠途徑讓到法庭旁聽人士知悉不可在法庭內攝影的規定",
            "最新近一宗在原訟法庭案件審訊中偷拍的事件的判刑亦已向公眾發出明確而且具阻嚇性的信息，法庭絕對不會姑息在法庭内非法攝影的行為",
