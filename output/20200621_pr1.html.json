            "In response to the summary of the explanatory statement by an official of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the 19th session of the Standing Committee of the 13th NPC on June 18 on a draft law on safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China, the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, today (June 21) made the following statement:",
            "The passage of the Decision on establishing and improving legal system and enforcement mechanisms for HKSAR to safeguard national security (the Decision) by the NPC on May 28, and the enactment of the legislation by the Standing Committee of the NPC for inclusion in Annex III of the Basic Law to be promulgated by the HKSAR are premised on constitutional and legal grounds. The legislation only aims to prevent, curb and sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security, so as to safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and the implementation of \"one country, two systems\".",
            "Article 4 of the Decision stipulates that the HKSAR must establish and improve institutions and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security to strengthen enforcement power and the enforcement work on national security. It is also set out in the explanatory statement that a commission for safeguarding national security should be set up by the HKSAR. The Department of Justice, as one of the government departments which shoulder the major responsibilities in implementing the relevant enforcement work, will establish a dedicated unit to handle prosecutions in relation to national security.",
            "Hong Kong has experienced social unrest with frequent violence over the past year. There is even advocacy of independence. In view of the increasingly serious situation the HKSAR is facing in relation to national security and the difficulty of the executive and legislative authorities of the HKSAR to complete on their own legislation for safeguarding national security in the foreseeable future, there is the need and emergency for the NPC to take steps at the national level to improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the HKSAR to safeguard national security.",
            "\"The explanatory statement clearly points out that the HKSAR, in safeguarding national security, should respect and protect human rights and freedoms which are applicable in Hong Kong under the Basic Law, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The provisions should be able to address public concerns. I will lead the Department of Justice to provide full support to the legislative work for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR.\" Ms Cheng said.",

            "全國人大五月二十八日通過《全國人民代表大會關於建立健全香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的決定》（以下簡稱《決定》），授權全國人大常委會制定香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律，並列入《基本法》附件三公布實施，做法完全依照憲制和法律理據。訂立相關法律的目的是為了防範、制止和懲治極少數危害國家安全的違法分子，以維護香港的繁榮穩定，讓「一國兩制」行穩致遠。",
            "《決定》第四條規定香港特別行政區應當建立健全維護國家安全的機構和執行機制，強化執法力量，加強維護國家安全執法工作。草案的說明提出了香港特別行政區應設立維護國家安全委員會，而律政司作為其中一個承擔執行維護國家安全主要任務的政府部門，亦會成立一個專門的國家安全犯罪案件檢控部門。",
            "香港在過去一年經歷了社會動盪，暴力不時發生，更甚者有人竟然鼓吹獨立。面臨國家安全局勢日趨嚴峻，香港特別行政區行政立法機關難以在一段可見時間內自行完成維護國家安全有關的立法，因此全國人大有需要和迫切性從國家層面進行改善香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。",
            "鄭若驊表示：「草案的說明清晰指出，香港特別行政區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港特別行政區居民根據《基本法》和《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》及《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港的有關規定享有的權利和自由，這些明確規定應可釋除公眾疑慮。我會率領律政司全力支持和配合港區維護國家安全的立法工作。」",
