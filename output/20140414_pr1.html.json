            "In response to media enquiries about the application for discharge of the warrant of arrest by Mr Ma Sik-chun, a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) said today (April 14) that the DoJ respects the judgment of the court delivered today.",
            "The spokesman said that one of the key grounds relied on in support of Ma's application is the absence of sufficient admissible evidence to justify placing Ma on trial for the offences upon which he was indicted.",
            "Following approaches by Ma's lawyers, the DoJ informed Ma's lawyers in 2005 that the DoJ had decided that there was no sufficient evidence available to the prosecution at that time to justify placing Ma on trial for any of the offences for which he was indicted in 1978. This conclusion was reached after detailed and careful analysis of the available evidence and witnesses. Among others, this conclusion was based on the consideration that the relevant witnesses had passed away, were unable to recall the relevant events due to long lapse of time or old age, or were unwilling to co-operate.",
            "In respect of the present application, the DoJ reconsidered the case against Ma by reference to the Prosecution Code, the available evidence and the applicable law. At the same time, independent legal advice was also sought from outside leading counsel. Outside leading counsel agreed with the assessment made by the DoJ in 2005, that is to say, there is no sufficient admissible evidence available to the prosecution to justify placing Ma on trial for any of the offences upon which he was indicted.",
            "As is made clear in paragraph 5.3 of the Prosecution Code, the decision to prosecute includes two required components: the first is that the admissible evidence available is sufficient to justify instituting or continuing proceedings; the second is that the general public interest must require that the prosecution be conducted. Further, paragraph 10.1 of the Prosecution Code provides, among others, as follows: \"A prosecutor remains under a duty continually to review a prosecution that has been commenced. The prosecution must be discontinued if, following a change of circumstances, a reapplication of the prosecution test at any stage indicates that the evidence is no longer sufficient to justify a reasonable prospect of conviction\".",
            "As stated above, there is no longer sufficient admissible evidence available to justify placing Ma on trial for any of the offences upon which he was indicted.",
            "As to what approach the DoJ would adopt in the event Ma returns to Hong Kong, the spokesman said that the DoJ has nothing further to add.",

            "回應傳媒查詢有關馬惜珍申請撤銷法院拘捕令的案件，律政司發言人今日（四月十四日）表示律政司尊重法庭今日的判決。",
            "發言人表示，馬惜珍的申請的其中一項主要理據是控方缺乏充分可接納的證據，讓馬惜珍就其被公訴的任何一項罪行受審。",
            "在接獲馬惜珍代表律師的申述後，律政司在二○○五年通知馬惜珍的律師，告知他們控方認為當時沒有充分證據，讓馬惜珍就一九七八年被公訴的任何一項罪行受審。這結論是經詳細及小心分析所有證據和證人後作出。其中一個考慮，是多名相關證人已去世，或因事隔多年或年老而無法記起相關事件，或不願意合作。",
            "關於這次申請，律政司依據《檢控守則》、現存證據和適用的法律，再檢視馬惜珍的案件，同時亦徵詢外聘資深大律師的獨立法律意見。外聘資深大律師同意律政司於二○○五年所作的評估，即控方已無充分可被法庭接納的證據讓馬惜珍就其被公訴的任何一項罪行受審。",
            "在《檢控守則》第5.3段清楚指出，作出檢控決定須符合兩個條件︰第一，所得的可接納證據充分支持提出或繼續進行法律程序；第二，基於一般公眾利益，必須進行檢控。在《檢控守則》第10.1段亦指出：「檢控人員有責任持續覆核已展開的檢控工作。隨情況有變，假如在任何階段重新應用檢控驗證標準而顯示有關證據不再足以確保有合理機會達至定罪，便應停止檢控。」",
            "如前文所述，現時控方已沒有充分可接納的證據，讓馬惜珍就其被公訴的任何一項罪行受審。",
            "至於如果馬惜珍返回香港時律政司會如何處理，發言人表示律政司沒有進一步補充。",
