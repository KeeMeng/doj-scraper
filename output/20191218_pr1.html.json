            "Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (December 18):",
            "Question:",
            "One of the main policy objectives of the Department of Justice is to enhance Hong Kong's status as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, in particular as an international arbitration hub. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it knows, in each of the past five years, the respective numbers of arbitration cases which were (i) seated in Hong Kong, (ii) heard in Hong Kong although not seated here, and (iii) provided only with secretarial support or services by the Hong Kong office of an arbitration institution; among such cases, the number of those which were international in nature; how such figures compare with those of Singapore and the causes for the differences;",
            "(2) of the total Gross Value Added of arbitration activities in Hong Kong (including the induced contribution) in each of the past five years, and its percentage in the legal sector's Gross Domestic Product in that year;",
            "(3) of the revenue brought by arbitration activities in each of the past five years, and its percentage in the Government's recurrent revenue in that year; and",
            "(4) whether it has assessed the impacts of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (especially the measures involving sanctions set out therein) enacted by the United States last month on Hong Kong as an international arbitration hub; if it has assessed, of the outcome; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "Arbitration is a dispute resolution mechanism consented to by the parties, the advantages of arbitration being its confidential nature, its upholding of the principle of parties' autonomy, the flexibility in its procedure, and the enforceability of its awards in the over 160 Contracting States to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitration Awards (New York Convention).",
            "A strong legal system (including a comprehensive legal infrastructure for arbitration) is conducive to attracting foreign direct investment for places around the world. To this end, it is one of the major long-term policy objectives of the Department of Justice (DoJ) in recent years to commit to the development and promotion of Hong Kong as a leading international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region, which objective complements Hong Kong's position as an international business and financial centre. In order to promote Hong Kong's legal services comprehensively, the DoJ has added the new policy objective of \"deal-making\" since 2018 and endeavours to enhance Hong Kong's position as a deal-making and dispute resolution hub.",
            "Under \"One Country, Two Systems\", Hong Kong enjoys unique double advantages in providing international arbitration services.",
            "First, pursuant to the constitutional safeguards laid down in the Basic Law, Hong Kong has a sound legal system and a rule of law tradition, as well as an independent judiciary. Hong Kong adopts the common law system, which is more familiar to the international commercial and trade community. Furthermore, Hong Kong has experienced dispute resolution talents and rich dispute resolution culture.",
            "Second, there is national support for the development of Hong Kong as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the region. In the chapter dedicated to Hong Kong and Macao under the national \"13th Five-Year Plan\", the Central Government has clearly voiced its support for Hong Kong to develop as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region. Similarly, the key developments mentioned in the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area published in February 2019 included the development of Hong Kong as a major international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the support for Hong Kong to develop as a service centre for resolving investment and commercial disputes in projects relating to the Belt and Road Initiative. Therefore, Hong Kong should seize the opportunities generated by the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development, in order to constantly enhance its competitiveness.",
            "A consolidated reply of the DoJ to the question raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:",
            "(1) to (3) Due to the features stated below, public information and statistics concerning arbitration activities in Hong Kong are very limited. The DoJ, therefore, does not have official figures requested in parts (1) to (3) of the question.",
            "(a) A distinctive feature of arbitration is its confidential nature. In order to better safeguard the confidentiality of arbitrations, the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609) restricts parties from publishing, disclosing or communicating any information relating to the arbitral proceedings or the award, unless where the parties agreed otherwise, where a party needs to protect or pursue own legal right or interest, or where a party discloses information relating to the arbitration when enforcing or challenging the award.",
            "(b) The Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609) currently in force has come into operation since 2011 and is based on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (Model Law). It superseded the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 341) and unified the legal frameworks of domestic arbitrations and international arbitrations. Since the commencement of the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609), the distinctions between the prescribed regimes of \"domestic arbitration\" and \"international arbitration\" has ceased to exist in the arbitration-related legal framework in Hong Kong.",
            "(c) Arbitral proceedings can be classified into the two main categories of institutional arbitration and ad hoc arbitration. Institutional arbitrations are administered by arbitral institutions (for example, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC)) in accordance with, generally, the arbitration rules of the arbitral institution which administers the arbitral proceedings. Ad hoc arbitrations are wholly \"administered\" by the arbitrator(s) and the parties, in accordance with readily available arbitration rules (for example, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) or rules tailor-made by the arbitral tribunal based on the nature of the case. In ad hoc arbitrations, if no party makes application to the court for enforcement or setting aside of arbitral award, any third party to the parties to the proceedings will not have knowledge of the arbitral proceedings having been conducted.",
            "In fact, the early development of arbitration in Hong Kong focused on ad hoc arbitration. Before the establishment of the HKIAC in 1985, a vast majority of the parties who chose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration would have opted for ad hoc arbitration. It was only in September 2008 that the HKIAC for the first time published its Administered Arbitration Rules.",
            "(d) Apart from parties' autonomy in terms of the arbitration rules, flexibility in the arbitral proceedings is also showcased in the parties' choice of arbitrator and representation. The Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609) does not impose any requirement with respect to the professional qualification of arbitrators and representation, such that arbitrators and representation in arbitral proceedings conducted in Hong Kong are not necessarily Hong Kong practising solicitors or barristers. In fact, depending on the complexity and technicality of the case, parties from different sectors may consider appointing relevant professionals concerning the issues in dispute in the case to discharge the role of arbitrator.",
            "We notice that, although the HKIAC publishes statistics concerning its arbitration and dispute resolution services, such statistics could not cover all arbitration cases conducted in Hong Kong, which include arbitration cases administered by other arbitral institutions, ad hoc arbitration cases, arbitration cases not seated in Hong Kong but heard in Hong Kong only, etc. For the above reasons, the statistics can only partially reflect the position of arbitration activities in Hong Kong.",
            "According to information made public by the HKIAC, we have tabulated the total number of new cases (including arbitrations, mediations and domain name disputes), overall arbitration cases, the percentage share of international arbitrations (i.e. at least one party was not from Hong Kong) out of the number of arbitration cases, the top five geographical origins or nationalities of the parties (apart from Hong Kong) and the total amount in dispute in the past five years (i.e. from 2014 to 2018) as follows.",
            "(Source: Statistics published in the HKIAC's Annual Reports and case statistics)",
            "Although the HKIAC has not yet published the statistics for 2019, the DoJ is given to understand that there has been an increase in the number of arbitration cases this year when compared with last year.",
            "The DoJ is mindful of the dedicated efforts of neighbouring regions, including Singapore, Malaysia, Korea as well as Mainland cities (for example, Shanghai, Shenzhen), to promote international arbitration services in recent years, which have posed serious challenges to Hong Kong. In the face of keen competition within the region, there is an urgent need for us to enhance the promotional work and policy initiatives, in order to capitalise on Hong Kong's intrinsic strengths, including the opportunities generated by the national Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's arbitration services as well as other dispute resolution services options.",
            "The DoJ has in recent years adopted various initiatives, fine-tuning the arbitration-related legal framework, attracting international dispute resolution institutions to set up offices in Hong Kong, and hosting large-scale international conferences relating to legal and dispute resolution services in Hong Kong. The Inclusive Dispute Avoidance and Resolution Office set up in early 2019 will continue to co-ordinate the promotional work related to arbitration and other dispute resolution measures within the DoJ.",
            "In order to keep abreast of the latest developments in international arbitration, the DoJ has made amendments to the Arbitration Ordinance from time to time in recent years, in order to clarify that disputes over intellectual property rights can be settled through arbitration and that third party funding of arbitration is permitted under the laws of Hong Kong. The relevant legislative amendments respectively came into operation in 2018 and in early 2019.",
            "In addition, the DoJ and the Supreme People's Court signed the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Interim Measures Arrangement) in April 2019, which came into force on October 1. The signing of the Interim Measures Arrangement is a major breakthrough to the benefit of Hong Kong under \"One Country, Two Systems\", signifying that Hong Kong has become the first and, to date, the only jurisdiction outside the Mainland where, as a seat of arbitration, parties to arbitral proceedings administered by the designated arbitral institutions would be able to apply to the Mainland courts for interim measures in order to ensure that the arbitral proceedings can be carried out effectively. This has been well-received by the local profession which generally considers that the Interim Measures Arrangement will help enhance the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a seat of arbitration for Mainland-related disputes.",
            "The DoJ understands that there have already been successful applications for interim measures made to the Mainland courts by parties to arbitral proceedings applicable under the Interim Measures Arrangement. Besides, in light of the Interim Measures Arrangement, the International Chamber of Commerce has published a Practice Note to the effect that arbitration cases seated in Hong Kong will be assigned to the Secretariat of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce – Asia Office (ICCICA – Asia Office) based in Hong Kong for administration. The DoJ anticipates that the Interim Measures Arrangement will continue to bring further opportunities for business expansion to Hong Kong's arbitration and dispute resolution sector.",
            "In addition to the HKIAC, the DoJ has constantly been making efforts in attracting internationally renowned arbitral institutions to set up regional office or branch institution in Hong Kong, including offices already established in Hong Kong, namely, the ICCICA – Asia Office, the Hong Kong Arbitration Center of the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission and the Hong Kong Arbitration Center of the China Maritime Arbitration Commission.",
            "In order to build Hong Kong into an international capacity-building hub, the DoJ has in recent years successfully co-organised many large-scale international conferences and events in Hong Kong together with international intergovernmental organisations and/or local legal and dispute resolution services sector, for example, the forum held in September 2018 to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the New York Convention, the Investor-State Dispute Settlement Reform Conference held in February 2019, the Third UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit held in November 2019, etc. The DoJ is also actively participating in the work of the UNCITRAL Working Group III in studying reforms of the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. The above measures will deepen the understanding of issues in international law amongst Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services sector and its contribution to developments in international law, so as to enhance the quality and international standing of Hong Kong's international legal and arbitration services.",
            "Going forward, the DoJ will continue to actively put forward new policy initiatives, for example, procuring the establishment of a regional arbitration centre in Hong Kong by the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization, the detailed arrangements of which is expected to be finalised in 2020; on the other hand, in order to provide more flexible fee structure options to parties in arbitration, the Law Reform Commission has formed a sub-committee to study the topic of outcome-related fee structure for arbitration.",
            "(4) The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government strongly opposes the enactment of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (Act) as the law of the United States. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has clearly indicated that the signing and giving of the force of law to the Act constituted grave intervention in the affairs of Hong Kong, gross interference with the internal affairs of China and serious violations of international law and basic principles in international relations.",
            "The uncertainty caused by the Act will inevitably affect the confidence of international investors and companies in Hong Kong. Having said that, as aforementioned, Hong Kong's legal system remains robust under \"One Country, Two Systems\". The DoJ will continue to exchange views and collaborate with the local and international communities with a view to consolidating different parties' confidence in Hong Kong's legal system and rule of law. The DoJ will also focus our efforts on promoting Hong Kong's international legal and arbitration services. We believe that, in the long run, the intrinsic strengths of Hong Kong, together with the advantages enjoyed by Hong Kong's dispute resolution services pursuant to the ground-breaking initiatives of the Belt and Road Initiative, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development and the Interim Measures Arrangement, etc., will help Hong Kong's dispute resolution services such as international arbitration, etc. to continue to thrive.",

            "以下是今日（十二月十八日）在立法會會議上梁繼昌議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "律政司的主要政策目標之一，是鞏固香港作為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心（尤其是國際仲裁樞紐）的地位。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）是否知悉，過去五年每年（i）以香港為仲裁地、（ii）非以香港為仲裁地但在香港舉行聆訊，以及（iii）只由仲裁機構的香港辦事處提供秘書支援或服務的仲裁個案宗數分別為何；該等個案當中，有多少宗屬國際性質；該等數字與新加坡的如何比較，以及有關差異的成因為何；",
            "（二）過去五年，每年仲裁活動在香港的增加價值總額（包括衍生的）及其佔法律界的本地生產總值的百分比；",
            "（三）過去五年，每年仲裁活動帶來多少公帑收入及其佔政府該年經常性收入的百分比；及",
            "（四）有否評估於上月訂立的美國《香港人權與民主法案》（特別當中涉及制裁的措施）對香港作為國際仲裁樞紐的影響；若有評估，結果為何；若否，原因為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "仲裁是經當事人同意的爭議解決機制，其優點在於仲裁的保密性、仲裁程序奉行當事人自主原則、仲裁程序具有彈性，以及仲裁裁決可透過《承認及執行外國仲裁裁決公約》（即《紐約公約》）在超過160個該公約的締約國執行。",
            "穩健的法律制度（包括完善的仲裁法律架構），有助各地吸引外來直接投資。就此，律政司近年的其中一個長期的主要政策目標，是致力發展和推動香港成為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心，該目標與香港作為國際商業及金融中心的地位相輔相成。為更全面推廣香港的法律服務，律政司自二○一八年起增加「促成交易」為另一政策重點，着力提升香港作為交易及爭議解決樞紐的地位。",
            "在「一國兩制」下，香港在提供國際仲裁服務方面，享有獨一無二的雙重優勢。",
            "第一，在《基本法》的憲制保障下，香港特區擁有完善的法律制度及法治傳統，以及獨立的司法機構，並沿用國際商貿界較為熟悉的普通法制度。另外，香港擁有經驗豐富的爭議解決人才及爭議解決文化。",
            "第二，國家支持香港發展為區內的國際法律及爭議解決服務中心。國家「十三．五」規劃的港澳專章中，中央政府明確支持香港建設為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心。同時，二○一九年二月公布的《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》中提及的發展重點包括將香港建設為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心，並支持香港成為解決「一帶一路」建設專案投資和商業爭議的服務中心。因此，香港應抓緊「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區建設規劃所帶來的機遇，不斷提升其競爭力。",
            "就梁繼昌議員提出的具體提問，律政司答覆如下：",
            "（一）至（三）基於下述一些特點，香港仲裁活動的公開資料和數據相當有限，律政司並沒有問題（一）至（三）要求的官方數字：",
            "（a）仲裁的特點在於其保密性，而為有效保障仲裁的保密性，《仲裁條例》（第609章）規定仲裁任何一方不得發表、披露或傳達任何關乎仲裁程序及裁決的資料，除非各方另有協議、參與仲裁程序一方需要保障或體現其法律權益，或者在強制執行或質疑某項仲裁裁決時，當事人才可披露有關仲裁的資料。",
            "（b）香港現行的《仲裁條例》（第609章）在二○一一年生效，以聯合國國際貿易法委員會（貿法委）《國際商事仲裁示範法》（《示範法》）為基礎，並取代舊有的《仲裁條例》（第341章），統一了本地仲裁及國際仲裁的法律框架。《仲裁條例》（第609章）生效後，香港與仲裁相關的法律框架再沒有「本地仲裁」與「國際仲裁」在法定體制上的區別。",
            "（c）仲裁程序可分為機構仲裁及臨時仲裁兩大類。機構仲裁程序由仲裁機構（如香港國際仲裁中心）管理，一般而言，按進行管理的仲裁機構的仲裁規則進行。臨時仲裁則完全由仲裁員和當事人「管理」，可以選用現成的仲裁規則（如《貿易法委員會仲裁規則》），或由仲裁庭就案件的性質制定合適的規則。在臨時仲裁中，如果當事人不向法院申請執行或撤銷仲裁裁決，則除當事人及仲裁庭成員外的第三者均不會知悉仲裁程序的進行。",
            "事實上，香港的仲裁發展早期以臨時仲裁程序為主。在香港國際仲裁中心於一九八五年成立之前，爭議雙方選擇以香港作為仲裁地，絕大多數採用臨時仲裁程序。香港國際仲裁中心在二○○八年九月才首次推出其《機構仲裁規則》。",
            "（d）除了爭議方對仲裁規則的自主外，仲裁程序的靈活性亦體現於爭議方對仲裁員及代表的選擇中。《仲裁條例》（第609章）沒有就仲裁員及代表的專業資格作規定，在香港進行的仲裁程序中的仲裁員及代表，不一定由香港執業律師或大律師出任。事實上，各個業界的爭議方可能因應案件的複雜程度和技術性，而考慮委任與案中爭議點相關的專業人士出任仲裁員。",
            "我們留意到，香港國際仲裁中心雖有公布其提供仲裁及爭議解決服務的一些數據，但有關數據未能涵蓋所有香港仲裁個案，包括由其他仲裁機構管理的仲裁案件、臨時仲裁案件、非以香港為仲裁地而僅在香港舉行聆訊的案件等，故公布的數據只能有限度反映香港仲裁活動的情況。",
            "根據香港國際仲裁中心的公開資料，我們表列了過去五年（即二○一四至二○一八年），香港國際仲裁中心受案總量（包括仲裁、調解，以及功能變數名稱爭議案件）、仲裁受案量、國際仲裁案件（即其中至少一方為非香港當事人）佔仲裁受案量的百分比、排名首五位當事人來自的國家或地區（除香港以外），以及仲裁案件總爭議金額如下。",
            "（資料來源：香港國際仲裁中心年度報告及統計數據中的公開數據）",
            "香港國際仲裁中心尚未公布二○一九年的數據，但據律政司了解，該機構本年的仲裁個案數字對比去年有所增長。",
            "律政司關注鄰近地區，包括新加坡、馬來西亞、韓國，以及多個內地城市（例如上海、深圳）近年來致力提升國際仲裁服務，為香港帶來嚴峻挑戰。面對區內激烈的競爭，我們有迫切需要加強相關工作及政策措施，善用香港的固有優勢，包括國家的「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區建設規劃為我們所帶來的機遇，繼續提升香港仲裁服務以至各爭議解決服務選項的競爭力。",
            "律政司近年一直竭力推行多項措施，完善與仲裁有關的法律框架，吸引國際爭議解決機構在香港設立辦事處，以及由香港主辦與法律及爭議解決服務相關的大型國際會議。於二○一九年初成立的普惠避免及解決爭議辦公室，將繼續統籌律政司內有關仲裁以及其他爭議解決措施的推廣工作。",
            "為應對國際仲裁的最新發展，律政司近年不時對《仲裁條例》提出修訂，以釐清知識產權爭議可透過仲裁解決及釐清香港法律容許第三者資助仲裁，相關法律修訂已分別於二○一八年及二○一九年初生效。",
            "此外，律政司與最高人民法院二○一九年四月簽署了具開創性的《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》（《保全安排》），《保全安排》已於十月一日生效。《保全安排》的簽署是香港受惠於「一國兩制」的重大突破，標誌着香港成為全球首個和目前唯一內地以外的司法管轄區，由指定仲裁機構管理的仲裁程序的當事人可向內地法院申請保全，以確保仲裁程序能有效進行。本地業界反應十分正面，認為《保全安排》有助增加香港作為處理與內地有關爭議的仲裁地的吸引力。",
            "根據律政司了解，已有適用於《保全安排》的香港仲裁程序當事人，成功向內地法院申請保全措施。而因應《保全安排》，國際商會已發布了實務指引，表示會將以香港為仲裁地的仲裁個案交由位於香港的國際商會國際仲裁院秘書局亞洲事務辦公室管理。律政司預期《保全安排》將會繼續為香港仲裁及爭議解決界帶來更多拓展業務的機遇。",
            "除了香港國際仲裁中心外，律政司一直致力吸引國際知名仲裁機構在香港設立地區辦事處或分支機構，包括已在香港設立辦公室的國際商會國際仲裁院秘書局的亞洲事務辦公室、中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會的香港仲裁中心，以及中國海事仲裁委員會的香港仲裁中心。",
            "為了將香港打造成為國際能力建設樞紐，近年律政司成功與國際政府間及業界組織及／或本地法律及爭議解決業界在香港合辦多個大型國際會議及活動，例如於二○一八年九月適逢《紐約公約》簽署60周年而舉辦的論壇、二○一九年二月的投資者與東道國間爭議解決機制改革研討會、二○一九年十一月的第三屆貿法委亞太司法會議等。律政司亦正積極參與貿法委第三工作組，有關投資者與東道國間爭議解決機制改革的研究工作。以上措施將加深香港法律及爭議解決界對國際法律議題的了解，對國際法的發展作出貢獻，提升香港國際法律及仲裁服務的水平及國際地位。",
            "展望未來工作，律政司會繼續積極推展新的政策措施，例如爭取亞洲──非洲法律協商組織在香港設立區域仲裁中心，期望可於二○二○年落實具體安排；另一方面，為向仲裁當事人提供更多彈性收費架構選項，法律改革委員會已成立小組委員會，研究與仲裁結果有關的收費架構。",
            "（四）香港特區政府強烈反對《香港人權與民主法案》（《法案》）成為美國法律。外交部早前已清楚表明，美方將《法案》簽署成法，此舉嚴重干預香港事務，嚴重干涉中國內政，嚴重違反國際法和國際關係基本準則。",
            "《法案》引起的不確定性無可避免會影響國際投資者及企業對香港的信心。儘管如此，正如上文闡釋，香港的法律制度在「一國兩制」下依然穩健，律政司會繼續與香港及國際社會溝通及合作，鞏固各方對香港的法律制度及法治的信心，亦會致力推廣香港的國際法律及仲裁服務。我們相信，長遠而言，香港的固有優勢以及香港爭議解決服務受惠於「一帶一路」倡議、粵港澳大灣區建設規劃、《保全安排》等始創性的措施所帶來的機遇，將有助香港的國際仲裁等爭議解決服務持續發展。",

            "Second, there is national support for the development of Hong Kong as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the region",
            "In the chapter dedicated to Hong Kong and Macao under the national \"13th Five-Year Plan\", the Central Government has clearly voiced its support for Hong Kong to develop as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region",
            "Similarly, the key developments mentioned in the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area published in February 2019 included the development of Hong Kong as a major international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the support for Hong Kong to develop as a service centre for resolving investment and commercial disputes in projects relating to the Belt and Road Initiative",
            "Therefore, Hong Kong should seize the opportunities generated by the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development, in order to constantly enhance its competitiveness.",
            "A consolidated reply of the DoJ to the question raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:",
            "(1) to (3) Due to the features stated below, public information and statistics concerning arbitration activities in Hong Kong are very limited",
            "The DoJ, therefore, does not have official figures requested in parts (1) to (3) of the question.",
            "(a) A distinctive feature of arbitration is its confidential nature",
            "In order to better safeguard the confidentiality of arbitrations, the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap",
            "609) restricts parties from publishing, disclosing or communicating any information relating to the arbitral proceedings or the award, unless where the parties agreed otherwise, where a party needs to protect or pursue own legal right or interest, or where a party discloses information relating to the arbitration when enforcing or challenging the award.",
            "(b) The Arbitration Ordinance (Cap",
            "609) currently in force has come into operation since 2011 and is based on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (Model Law)",
            "It superseded the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap",
            "341) and unified the legal frameworks of domestic arbitrations and international arbitrations",
            "Since the commencement of the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap",
            "609), the distinctions between the prescribed regimes of \"domestic arbitration\" and \"international arbitration\" has ceased to exist in the arbitration-related legal framework in Hong Kong.",
            "(c) Arbitral proceedings can be classified into the two main categories of institutional arbitration and ad hoc arbitration",
            "Institutional arbitrations are administered by arbitral institutions (for example, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC)) in accordance with, generally, the arbitration rules of the arbitral institution which administers the arbitral proceedings",
            "Ad hoc arbitrations are wholly \"administered\" by the arbitrator(s) and the parties, in accordance with readily available arbitration rules (for example, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) or rules tailor-made by the arbitral tribunal based on the nature of the case",
            "In ad hoc arbitrations, if no party makes application to the court for enforcement or setting aside of arbitral award, any third party to the parties to the proceedings will not have knowledge of the arbitral proceedings having been conducted.",
            "In fact, the early development of arbitration in Hong Kong focused on ad hoc arbitration",
            "Before the establishment of the HKIAC in 1985, a vast majority of the parties who chose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration would have opted for ad hoc arbitration",
            "It was only in September 2008 that the HKIAC for the first time published its Administered Arbitration Rules.",
            "(d) Apart from parties' autonomy in terms of the arbitration rules, flexibility in the arbitral proceedings is also showcased in the parties' choice of arbitrator and representation",
            "The Arbitration Ordinance (Cap",
            "609) does not impose any requirement with respect to the professional qualification of arbitrators and representation, such that arbitrators and representation in arbitral proceedings conducted in Hong Kong are not necessarily Hong Kong practising solicitors or barristers",
            "In fact, depending on the complexity and technicality of the case, parties from different sectors may consider appointing relevant professionals concerning the issues in dispute in the case to discharge the role of arbitrator.",
            "We notice that, although the HKIAC publishes statistics concerning its arbitration and dispute resolution services, such statistics could not cover all arbitration cases conducted in Hong Kong, which include arbitration cases administered by other arbitral institutions, ad hoc arbitration cases, arbitration cases not seated in Hong Kong but heard in Hong Kong only, etc",
            "For the above reasons, the statistics can only partially reflect the position of arbitration activities in Hong Kong.",
            "According to information made public by the HKIAC, we have tabulated the total number of new cases (including arbitrations, mediations and domain name disputes), overall arbitration cases, the percentage share of international arbitrations (i.e",
            "at least one party was not from Hong Kong) out of the number of arbitration cases, the top five geographical origins or nationalities of the parties (apart from Hong Kong) and the total amount in dispute in the past five years (i.e",
            "from 2014 to 2018) as follows.",
            "(Source: Statistics published in the HKIAC's Annual Reports and case statistics)",
            "Although the HKIAC has not yet published the statistics for 2019, the DoJ is given to understand that there has been an increase in the number of arbitration cases this year when compared with last year.",
            "The DoJ is mindful of the dedicated efforts of neighbouring regions, including Singapore, Malaysia, Korea as well as Mainland cities (for example, Shanghai, Shenzhen), to promote international arbitration services in recent years, which have posed serious challenges to Hong Kong",
            "In the face of keen competition within the region, there is an urgent need for us to enhance the promotional work and policy initiatives, in order to capitalise on Hong Kong's intrinsic strengths, including the opportunities generated by the national Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's arbitration services as well as other dispute resolution services options.",
            "The DoJ has in recent years adopted various initiatives, fine-tuning the arbitration-related legal framework, attracting international dispute resolution institutions to set up offices in Hong Kong, and hosting large-scale international conferences relating to legal and dispute resolution services in Hong Kong",
            "The Inclusive Dispute Avoidance and Resolution Office set up in early 2019 will continue to co-ordinate the promotional work related to arbitration and other dispute resolution measures within the DoJ.",
            "In order to keep abreast of the latest developments in international arbitration, the DoJ has made amendments to the Arbitration Ordinance from time to time in recent years, in order to clarify that disputes over intellectual property rights can be settled through arbitration and that third party funding of arbitration is permitted under the laws of Hong Kong",
            "The relevant legislative amendments respectively came into operation in 2018 and in early 2019.",
            "In addition, the DoJ and the Supreme People's Court signed the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Interim Measures Arrangement) in April 2019, which came into force on October 1",
            "The signing of the Interim Measures Arrangement is a major breakthrough to the benefit of Hong Kong under \"One Country, Two Systems\", signifying that Hong Kong has become the first and, to date, the only jurisdiction outside the Mainland where, as a seat of arbitration, parties to arbitral proceedings administered by the designated arbitral institutions would be able to apply to the Mainland courts for interim measures in order to ensure that the arbitral proceedings can be carried out effectively",
            "This has been well-received by the local profession which generally considers that the Interim Measures Arrangement will help enhance the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a seat of arbitration for Mainland-related disputes.",
            "The DoJ understands that there have already been successful applications for interim measures made to the Mainland courts by parties to arbitral proceedings applicable under the Interim Measures Arrangement",
            "Besides, in light of the Interim Measures Arrangement, the International Chamber of Commerce has published a Practice Note to the effect that arbitration cases seated in Hong Kong will be assigned to the Secretariat of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce – Asia Office (ICCICA – Asia Office) based in Hong Kong for administration",
            "The DoJ anticipates that the Interim Measures Arrangement will continue to bring further opportunities for business expansion to Hong Kong's arbitration and dispute resolution sector.",
            "In addition to the HKIAC, the DoJ has constantly been making efforts in attracting internationally renowned arbitral institutions to set up regional office or branch institution in Hong Kong, including offices already established in Hong Kong, namely, the ICCICA – Asia Office, the Hong Kong Arbitration Center of the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission and the Hong Kong Arbitration Center of the China Maritime Arbitration Commission.",
            "In order to build Hong Kong into an international capacity-building hub, the DoJ has in recent years successfully co-organised many large-scale international conferences and events in Hong Kong together with international intergovernmental organisations and/or local legal and dispute resolution services sector, for example, the forum held in September 2018 to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the New York Convention, the Investor-State Dispute Settlement Reform Conference held in February 2019, the Third UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit held in November 2019, etc",
            "The DoJ is also actively participating in the work of the UNCITRAL Working Group III in studying reforms of the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism",
            "The above measures will deepen the understanding of issues in international law amongst Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services sector and its contribution to developments in international law, so as to enhance the quality and international standing of Hong Kong's international legal and arbitration services.",
            "Going forward, the DoJ will continue to actively put forward new policy initiatives, for example, procuring the establishment of a regional arbitration centre in Hong Kong by the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization, the detailed arrangements of which is expected to be finalised in 2020; on the other hand, in order to provide more flexible fee structure options to parties in arbitration, the Law Reform Commission has formed a sub-committee to study the topic of outcome-related fee structure for arbitration.",
            "(4) The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government strongly opposes the enactment of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (Act) as the law of the United States",
            "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has clearly indicated that the signing and giving of the force of law to the Act constituted grave intervention in the affairs of Hong Kong, gross interference with the internal affairs of China and serious violations of international law and basic principles in international relations.",
            "The uncertainty caused by the Act will inevitably affect the confidence of international investors and companies in Hong Kong",
            "Having said that, as aforementioned, Hong Kong's legal system remains robust under \"One Country, Two Systems\"",
            "The DoJ will continue to exchange views and collaborate with the local and international communities with a view to consolidating different parties' confidence in Hong Kong's legal system and rule of law",
            "The DoJ will also focus our efforts on promoting Hong Kong's international legal and arbitration services",
            "We believe that, in the long run, the intrinsic strengths of Hong Kong, together with the advantages enjoyed by Hong Kong's dispute resolution services pursuant to the ground-breaking initiatives of the Belt and Road Initiative, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development and the Interim Measures Arrangement, etc., will help Hong Kong's dispute resolution services such as international arbitration, etc",
            "to continue to thrive.",

            "（一）是否知悉，過去五年每年（i）以香港為仲裁地、（ii）非以香港為仲裁地但在香港舉行聆訊，以及（iii）只由仲裁機構的香港辦事處提供秘書支援或服務的仲裁個案宗數分別為何；該等個案當中，有多少宗屬國際性質；該等數字與新加坡的如何比較，以及有關差異的成因為何；",
            "（二）過去五年，每年仲裁活動在香港的增加價值總額（包括衍生的）及其佔法律界的本地生產總值的百分比；",

            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "仲裁是經當事人同意的爭議解決機制，其優點在於仲裁的保密性、仲裁程序奉行當事人自主原則、仲裁程序具有彈性，以及仲裁裁決可透過《承認及執行外國仲裁裁決公約》（即《紐約公約》）在超過160個該公約的締約國執行",
            "穩健的法律制度（包括完善的仲裁法律架構），有助各地吸引外來直接投資",
            "就此，律政司近年的其中一個長期的主要政策目標，是致力發展和推動香港成為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心，該目標與香港作為國際商業及金融中心的地位相輔相成",
            "為更全面推廣香港的法律服務，律政司自二○一八年起增加「促成交易」為另一政策重點，着力提升香港作為交易及爭議解決樞紐的地位",
            "在「一國兩制」下，香港在提供國際仲裁服務方面，享有獨一無二的雙重優勢",
            "第一，在《基本法》的憲制保障下，香港特區擁有完善的法律制度及法治傳統，以及獨立的司法機構，並沿用國際商貿界較為熟悉的普通法制度",
            "另外，香港擁有經驗豐富的爭議解決人才及爭議解決文化",
            "第二，國家支持香港發展為區內的國際法律及爭議解決服務中心",
            "國家「十三．五」規劃的港澳專章中，中央政府明確支持香港建設為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心",
            "同時，二○一九年二月公布的《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》中提及的發展重點包括將香港建設為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心，並支持香港成為解決「一帶一路」建設專案投資和商業爭議的服務中心",
            "因此，香港應抓緊「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區建設規劃所帶來的機遇，不斷提升其競爭力",
            "就梁繼昌議員提出的具體提問，律政司答覆如下：",
            "（一）至（三）基於下述一些特點，香港仲裁活動的公開資料和數據相當有限，律政司並沒有問題（一）至（三）要求的官方數字：",
            "（a）仲裁的特點在於其保密性，而為有效保障仲裁的保密性，《仲裁條例》（第609章）規定仲裁任何一方不得發表、披露或傳達任何關乎仲裁程序及裁決的資料，除非各方另有協議、參與仲裁程序一方需要保障或體現其法律權益，或者在強制執行或質疑某項仲裁裁決時，當事人才可披露有關仲裁的資料",
            "（b）香港現行的《仲裁條例》（第609章）在二○一一年生效，以聯合國國際貿易法委員會（貿法委）《國際商事仲裁示範法》（《示範法》）為基礎，並取代舊有的《仲裁條例》（第341章），統一了本地仲裁及國際仲裁的法律框架",
            "《仲裁條例》（第609章）生效後，香港與仲裁相關的法律框架再沒有「本地仲裁」與「國際仲裁」在法定體制上的區別",
            "（c）仲裁程序可分為機構仲裁及臨時仲裁兩大類",
            "機構仲裁程序由仲裁機構（如香港國際仲裁中心）管理，一般而言，按進行管理的仲裁機構的仲裁規則進行",
            "臨時仲裁則完全由仲裁員和當事人「管理」，可以選用現成的仲裁規則（如《貿易法委員會仲裁規則》），或由仲裁庭就案件的性質制定合適的規則",
            "在臨時仲裁中，如果當事人不向法院申請執行或撤銷仲裁裁決，則除當事人及仲裁庭成員外的第三者均不會知悉仲裁程序的進行",
            "事實上，香港的仲裁發展早期以臨時仲裁程序為主",
            "在香港國際仲裁中心於一九八五年成立之前，爭議雙方選擇以香港作為仲裁地，絕大多數採用臨時仲裁程序",
            "香港國際仲裁中心在二○○八年九月才首次推出其《機構仲裁規則》",
            "（d）除了爭議方對仲裁規則的自主外，仲裁程序的靈活性亦體現於爭議方對仲裁員及代表的選擇中",
            "《仲裁條例》（第609章）沒有就仲裁員及代表的專業資格作規定，在香港進行的仲裁程序中的仲裁員及代表，不一定由香港執業律師或大律師出任",
            "事實上，各個業界的爭議方可能因應案件的複雜程度和技術性，而考慮委任與案中爭議點相關的專業人士出任仲裁員",
            "我們留意到，香港國際仲裁中心雖有公布其提供仲裁及爭議解決服務的一些數據，但有關數據未能涵蓋所有香港仲裁個案，包括由其他仲裁機構管理的仲裁案件、臨時仲裁案件、非以香港為仲裁地而僅在香港舉行聆訊的案件等，故公布的數據只能有限度反映香港仲裁活動的情況",
            "根據香港國際仲裁中心的公開資料，我們表列了過去五年（即二○一四至二○一八年），香港國際仲裁中心受案總量（包括仲裁、調解，以及功能變數名稱爭議案件）、仲裁受案量、國際仲裁案件（即其中至少一方為非香港當事人）佔仲裁受案量的百分比、排名首五位當事人來自的國家或地區（除香港以外），以及仲裁案件總爭議金額如下",
            "（資料來源：香港國際仲裁中心年度報告及統計數據中的公開數據）",
            "香港國際仲裁中心尚未公布二○一九年的數據，但據律政司了解，該機構本年的仲裁個案數字對比去年有所增長",
            "律政司關注鄰近地區，包括新加坡、馬來西亞、韓國，以及多個內地城市（例如上海、深圳）近年來致力提升國際仲裁服務，為香港帶來嚴峻挑戰",
            "面對區內激烈的競爭，我們有迫切需要加強相關工作及政策措施，善用香港的固有優勢，包括國家的「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區建設規劃為我們所帶來的機遇，繼續提升香港仲裁服務以至各爭議解決服務選項的競爭力",
            "律政司近年一直竭力推行多項措施，完善與仲裁有關的法律框架，吸引國際爭議解決機構在香港設立辦事處，以及由香港主辦與法律及爭議解決服務相關的大型國際會議",
            "於二○一九年初成立的普惠避免及解決爭議辦公室，將繼續統籌律政司內有關仲裁以及其他爭議解決措施的推廣工作",
            "為應對國際仲裁的最新發展，律政司近年不時對《仲裁條例》提出修訂，以釐清知識產權爭議可透過仲裁解決及釐清香港法律容許第三者資助仲裁，相關法律修訂已分別於二○一八年及二○一九年初生效",
            "此外，律政司與最高人民法院二○一九年四月簽署了具開創性的《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》（《保全安排》），《保全安排》已於十月一日生效",
            "《保全安排》的簽署是香港受惠於「一國兩制」的重大突破，標誌着香港成為全球首個和目前唯一內地以外的司法管轄區，由指定仲裁機構管理的仲裁程序的當事人可向內地法院申請保全，以確保仲裁程序能有效進行",
            "本地業界反應十分正面，認為《保全安排》有助增加香港作為處理與內地有關爭議的仲裁地的吸引力",
            "根據律政司了解，已有適用於《保全安排》的香港仲裁程序當事人，成功向內地法院申請保全措施",
            "而因應《保全安排》，國際商會已發布了實務指引，表示會將以香港為仲裁地的仲裁個案交由位於香港的國際商會國際仲裁院秘書局亞洲事務辦公室管理",
            "律政司預期《保全安排》將會繼續為香港仲裁及爭議解決界帶來更多拓展業務的機遇",
            "除了香港國際仲裁中心外，律政司一直致力吸引國際知名仲裁機構在香港設立地區辦事處或分支機構，包括已在香港設立辦公室的國際商會國際仲裁院秘書局的亞洲事務辦公室、中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會的香港仲裁中心，以及中國海事仲裁委員會的香港仲裁中心",
            "為了將香港打造成為國際能力建設樞紐，近年律政司成功與國際政府間及業界組織及／或本地法律及爭議解決業界在香港合辦多個大型國際會議及活動，例如於二○一八年九月適逢《紐約公約》簽署60周年而舉辦的論壇、二○一九年二月的投資者與東道國間爭議解決機制改革研討會、二○一九年十一月的第三屆貿法委亞太司法會議等",
            "律政司亦正積極參與貿法委第三工作組，有關投資者與東道國間爭議解決機制改革的研究工作",
            "以上措施將加深香港法律及爭議解決界對國際法律議題的了解，對國際法的發展作出貢獻，提升香港國際法律及仲裁服務的水平及國際地位",
            "展望未來工作，律政司會繼續積極推展新的政策措施，例如爭取亞洲──非洲法律協商組織在香港設立區域仲裁中心，期望可於二○二○年落實具體安排；另一方面，為向仲裁當事人提供更多彈性收費架構選項，法律改革委員會已成立小組委員會，研究與仲裁結果有關的收費架構",
            "（四）香港特區政府強烈反對《香港人權與民主法案》（《法案》）成為美國法律",
            "外交部早前已清楚表明，美方將《法案》簽署成法，此舉嚴重干預香港事務，嚴重干涉中國內政，嚴重違反國際法和國際關係基本準則",
            "《法案》引起的不確定性無可避免會影響國際投資者及企業對香港的信心",
            "儘管如此，正如上文闡釋，香港的法律制度在「一國兩制」下依然穩健，律政司會繼續與香港及國際社會溝通及合作，鞏固各方對香港的法律制度及法治的信心，亦會致力推廣香港的國際法律及仲裁服務",
            "我們相信，長遠而言，香港的固有優勢以及香港爭議解決服務受惠於「一帶一路」倡議、粵港澳大灣區建設規劃、《保全安排》等始創性的措施所帶來的機遇，將有助香港的國際仲裁等爭議解決服務持續發展",
