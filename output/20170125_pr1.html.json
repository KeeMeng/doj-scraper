            "The Government will introduce the Apology Bill to state the legal consequences of making an apology in certain proceedings and legal matters. The main objective of the Bill is to promote and encourage the making of timely apologies in order to facilitate the amicable resolution of disputes.",
            "A spokesman for the Department of Justice said today (January 25), \"The introduction of the new legislation will provide certainty on the legal implications of making an apology by a party to a dispute in Hong Kong. Furthermore, Hong Kong will become the first jurisdiction in Asia to have apology legislation enacted, and this will help to further enhance Hong Kong's status as a centre for dispute resolution, especially in the context of mediation.\"",
            "The Bill was formulated on the basis of the recommendations made by the Steering Committee on Mediation, which conducted two rounds of public consultation in June 2015 and February 2016. The Administration of Justice and Legal Services Panel of the Legislative Council was briefed about the apology legislation by the Steering Committee and the Department of Justice. The Panel and responses received during the two rounds of public consultation were supportive of the proposed legislation.",
            "The spokesman added that the Bill provides for the effect of an apology in most civil proceedings including disciplinary proceedings and regulatory proceedings. Under the Bill, an apology does not constitute an admission of fault or liability, neither could it be taken into account nor is it admissible as evidence for determining fault or liability to the detriment of the apology maker. The Bill also provides that an apology does not void or otherwise affect any insurance cover under a contract of insurance or indemnity.",
            "The Bill will be gazetted on Friday (January 27) and introduced into the Legislative Council on February 8.",

            "政府將向立法會提出《道歉條例草案》（《條例草案》），訂明在某些程序及法律事宜中作出道歉的法律後果。《條例草案》的主要目的是提倡和鼓勵爭端當事人適時作出道歉，以和睦的方式排解爭端。",
            "律政司發言人今日（一月二十五日）表示：「建議的新法例將確定爭端當事人在香港作出道歉的法律含意，此外，香港會成為亞洲首個制定道歉法例的司法管轄區，有助進一步提升香港作為爭議解決中心的地位，尤其是在調解方面。」",
            "該《條例草案》是根據調解督導委員會（委員會）的意見制訂，委員會在二○一五年六月及二○一六年二月進行兩輪公眾諮詢。委員會及律政司已向立法會司法及法律事務委員會簡介道歉法例，事務委員會及兩輪公眾諮詢收到的回應均支持建議的新法例。",
            "發言人補充，《條例草案》訂明在大部分民事法律程序（包括紀律處分程序及規管性程序）中道歉的法律後果。《條例草案》規定，道歉並不構成承認過失或法律責任，而在裁斷過失或法律責任時，亦不得將道歉列為或接納為不利於道歉者的考慮因素或證據。另外，《條例草案》規定，根據保險或彌償合約對任何人提供的保險保障，不會因某人的道歉而失效或受到其他影響。",
