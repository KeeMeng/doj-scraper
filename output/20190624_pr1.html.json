            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at a media session after attending the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services meeting at the Legislative Council today (June 24):",
            "Reporter: If the Government is not going to look at the amendment again, why are you insisting not to scrap the law completely? And why are you leaving the alleged police violence to the complaint mechanism? Why are the police immune to criminal investigation? And can you meet protesters' demand not to prosecute those people arrested?",
            "Secretary for Justice: First question, the Government has literally stopped the legislative process that is before the Legislative Council in relation to the amendments of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance. There is no specific timetable. There is no chance that the Government will out of the blue suddenly reactivate the whole process, and we all know that next year, by July, the term of the Legislative Council is coming to an end. If for whatever reason the bill lapses, the Government will accept that and continue to do the best with the rest of the work.",
            "The second question relates to the prosecution angle, and I think the fourth as well, and I can put it together in this way. There is no decision one way or another as to whether the persons involved on a particular day is or is not to be prosecuted, there simply is no decision. There is no presumption that people should make as to whether any prosecution will or will not be done, because when the Department of Justice decides whether or not to prosecute, to make the prosecutorial decisions, we look at the relevant law, admissible evidence, the Prosecution Code, and decide whether a reasonable prospect of conviction could be reached, and of course to consider whether in the public interest, the particular individual in the particular case should or should not be prosecuted. So, it is a matter of objective and evidential based, rather than just by who calling what in the name. That is very important.",
            "In your third question, you seem to suggest, and that is why I think the premise is important, that there is a favour one way or another between the police or the protesters. It is very important to bear in mind that we are a society, the core value of which is that of the rule of law. Everybody is equal before the law, be they the protesters or the police. However, there are of course a number of concerns that have been raised as to how certain complaints are to be dealt with. The Government has heard these concerns, and I would suggest that one very good way to start considering how to deal with it is to use the existing mechanism in order to consider the relevant complaints and from there to decide what to do.",
            "Reporter: The Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services has just now passed a non-binding motion, how do you prepare to respond to the demands passed, or are you still standing firm on your stance over the need to change the POO (Public Order Ordinance), and do you regard this as a silent protest from the pro-establishment camp because of this outstanding extradition bill, there is a irreconcilable differences and damage caused within the pro-establishment camp and the Government?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Your first question has a premise which has not been established, that is you said I stand firm on something. I have not stood firm on the particular matter you talked about, so please put that into perspective. Therefore, in answer to your question, which is the first part, and that is, what is my response to the non-binding motion? We respect the Legislative Council’s wishes, and it is very useful to hear their views in forums like just now in the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services, and we will consider what is to be done about the particular ordinance, and whether it should be dealt with by the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong or otherwise.",
            "As to the second area, I think you are talking about the working relation with the pro-establishment camp, again it has a premise which I am not sure how I can react to, because I think the pro-establishment camp has expressed their views, and we are grateful for their understanding and support in the past years, and in the recent situation. They are perfectly entitled to react in a way that they think appropriate, and I think this is a very important matter of the Legislative Council and the executive, that is the Government, working together for the betterment of Hong Kong.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（六月二十四日）出席立法會司法及法律事務委員會會議後，與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "律政司司長：多謝各位媒體朋友。今天法律改革委員會（法改會）在司法及法律事務委員會作了一個簡介，報告我們的工作進展。在法改會自一九八二年成立以來，推出了６６份報告，其中一個不需要修改法律，餘下的６５個當中，有３５個已經全面落實，有２４個已獲部分落實或者正在考慮之中。在二○一八年年初至今，法改會推出了五份諮詢文件，以及一份報告書。我們會盡量做好工作。今日這個年度報告，是希望通過我們的報告，表達法改會和立法會對落實報告書進度的關注，亦希望通過年度報告，我們能更積極地落實報告書的建議，或作出相關的回應，讓政府的工作可以做得更好。多謝各位。",
            "記者：就《逃犯條例》方面，會否考慮修改字眼，用「撤回」而不是用「暫緩」，會否回應社會上一些示威者的訴求，不檢控參與六月十二日的集會人士？",
            "律政司司長：在修訂《逃犯條例》的工作，政府已經停止在立法會大會的審議工作，我們亦沒有一個既定的時間表，政府亦不會貿然重新再重啟這項相關工作，所以如果到明年七月立法年度過了後，條例草案將失效，政府亦會接受這個情況。",
            "至於第二個問題，我在此再重申，作一個決定檢控與否，律政司的工作是獨立、不偏不倚地去做。換句話說，無論任何人對當日的事件或哪一天的事件也好，他如何說該事件或情況是或不是一個暴動，律政司的工作也是獨立，是按法律、看證據，按我們的《檢控守則》檢視是否達至一個合理定罪機會的驗證標準，我們才會作出檢控與否的決定。所以現時沒有人可以說會或不會作出任何檢控。",
            "記者：政府其實在明年亦不會再做移交逃犯的修例工作，但現時建制派也表示，如果政府覺得可以修復社會，他們的支持者也會理解政府用「撤回」的字眼，政府會否考慮用「撤回」的字眼去增加社會對政府的信心？",
            "律政司司長：我會這樣去看這件事，我們不要斟酌該詞語，其實大家今次關注的，是大家在理解上，或者有些關注點可能覺得政府未曾足夠去處理。所以在這些情況下，將會發生或日後的情況大概會怎樣，其實大家也會知道，也差不多等同大家所要求的情況，所以我希望不要斟酌字眼。",
