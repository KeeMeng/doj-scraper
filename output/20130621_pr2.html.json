            "Chairman of the Bar, Vice President of the Law Society, the Honorable Legislative Councillor Mr Dennis Kwok, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:",
            "It gives me great pleasure to be here with you all at the official opening of this meaningful event, Prosecution Week 2013, organised by the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice. It is the second time the meaningful function, Prosecution Week, is held. The theme chosen this year is \"ROLE\" which signifies Rule of Law - Enforced. Its purpose is to promote community awareness of the Rule of Law in the criminal context.",
            "The rule of law is one of the most important core values of our society and the cornerstone of our success as a safe, fair and just community. Each of us should strive to uphold rule of law at all times and with firm commitment. Disrespect for the law is disrespect for our values, our way of life, our community and most importantly, each other.",
            "Almost on a daily basis, we see in newspapers numerous reports of criminal proceedings and court hearings covering a wide variety of cases, ranging from shop theft in the Magistrates' Courts to highly complex commercial cases tried in the District Court or the Court of the First Instance. It is therefore understandable that the public will judge the Department's performance in upholding the rule of law through the work of the Prosecutions Division, including its decisions to prosecute and the ways it handles cases.",
            "Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that the Department of Justice \"shall control criminal prosecution, free from any interference\". The strong team of dedicated prosecutors, paralegals and supporting staff of the Prosecutions Division, led by Mr Kevin Zervos, SC, our Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), provides strong support to me and the Department in discharging this constitutional duty. In performing this very important role, prosecutors always use their best endeavours to ensure that justice is done, and is seen to be done, at all times. Prosecutions are handled in accordance with the established policy guidelines, namely \"the Statement of the Prosecution Policy and Practice\". Only cases with a reasonable prospect of success of conviction are placed before the court. Further, cases will only be proceeded with by way of prosecution if it is in public interest to do so. Prosecution decisions are always made and taken forward in a fair, independent and objective manner. The Department of Justice does not and will not allow any form of interference in the prosecution work.",
            "In pursuit of its goal in upholding its long-standing commitment in ensuring a fair and effective administration of the criminal justice system for the benefit of all the people in Hong Kong, the Department has always placed great emphasis on its co-operation with the legal profession in order to enhance criminal justice. The fact that counsel and solicitors in private practice are regularly retained to prosecute on behalf of the Department is one of the examples which clearly demonstrates the Department's working partnership with the legal profession.",
            "Further, the Prosecutions Division has in the past year organised a number of conferences, including the Criminal Law Conference, which was held in November last year, dealing with criminal justice reform whereby the Judiciary and the legal profession (both local and overseas) jointly discussed major criminal law issues in Hong Kong.",
            "In addition, last month, the Prosecutions Division hosted the 12th Heads of Prosecuting Agencies Conference with the theme \"Challenges to a Modern Prosecution Service: moving with the times\". The heads of prosecuting agencies of a wide range of common law and related jurisdictions gathered in Hong Kong to discuss and focus on current trends and issues as well as the challenges faced by a modern prosecution service. During this conference, the Prosecutions Division invited members of the Judiciary and the legal profession to participate in some of the functions so as to provide an opportunity for useful exchange and discussion.",
            "The Prosecutions Division, as part of its commitment for continuing legal education, invites members of the legal profession to participate in training courses conducted by the Prosecutions Division. Since 2011, it has joined hands with the Bar Association and the Law Society to provide training courses to newly qualified lawyers who are interested in prosecuting cases for the Department. As I informed the Administration of Justice and Legal Services Panel of the Legislative Council earlier this year, following up on the success of the previous runs of the programme, we will regularise the arrangement of the Joint Training Programme, which will help enhance the professional standard of the younger members of the legal profession and the quality of the prosecution service overall.",
            "All that I have told you regarding the efforts we made in enhancing criminal justice would have been meaningless if we did not have the public's confidence and support in the criminal justice system. Promotion of greater transparency in prosecutorial work and practice is one of the keys to gaining public confidence. In this regard, the Prosecutions Division continues to publish the Yearly Review to provide the public with a detailed account of the challenges it has faced and the achievements it has made during the year under review. Further, it has actively engaged in dialogue with interested individuals or groups on a variety of issues of common interest in relation to the criminal justice system, so as to enhance openness and to foster closer communication with the community it serves.",
            "The Prosecution Week 2013 is to emphasise the role that can be played by individuals and groups in the community in upholding the rule of law. I am very pleased to see here with us today not only representatives of the legal profession and our law enforcement agencies, but also representatives of different sectors of the community which our prosecution system serves. Apart from this opening ceremony, various lively and informative activities - like school talks, guided visits as well as photographs and poster competitions - have been arranged. Through these activities, not only will the public come to know more about the work of the Prosecutions Division and how prosecutorial decisions are made, but more importantly, the role that they, as citizens, can play in furthering the interests of criminal justice.",
            "Last but not least, I wish to thank the Bar Association and the Law Society for the full support that they have given to Prosecution Week 2013. May I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to our DPP, Mr Kevin Zervos SC, and the other colleagues who assisted in organising this Prosecution Week 2013. Without their hard work and dedication, this event could not possibly have been successfully organised.",
            "On this note, I now formally declare the opening of Prosecution Week 2013.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Ends/Friday, June 21, 2013"

            "大律師公會主席、律師會副會長、立法會議員郭榮鏗、各位嘉賓、各位先生、女士：",
            "我很高興與各位一同參加檢控週２０１３這項饒富意義的活動的開幕典禮。這是律政司刑事檢控科第二次舉辦這項意義重大的活動。今年所定的主題是「秉行法治 各飾角色」，其意思是在維護法治方面，每個市民均各有其角色，而活動的目的，是增進公眾人士在刑事範疇對法治的認識。",
            "法治是我們社會最重要的核心價值之一，也是我們這個安全、公平、公正的社會賴以成功的基石。我們每個人均應時刻竭盡所能，堅定不移地維護法治精神。不尊重法律，就是不尊重我們的核心價值、我們的生活方式、我們的社會，而最重要的，是不尊重他人。",
            "我們差不多每天都在報章看到有關刑事法律程序和法庭聆訊的報道，涉及林林總總的案件，由裁判法院判決的店鋪盜竊案，以至區域法院或原訟法庭審理的非常複雜商業案件不等。因此，可以理解市民會以刑事檢控科的工作，包括該科所作的檢控決定和處理案件的方式，來判斷律政司在維護法治方面的表現。",
            "《基本法》第六十三條規定，律政司「主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」。律政司刑事檢控專員薛偉成資深大律師所領導精明能幹的隊伍（包括檢控人員、法律輔助人員及支援人員），給予強力支援，協助我和部門履行這項憲制責任。檢控人員在執行這項十分重要的工作時，會致力確保時刻秉行公義，並加以彰顯。我們一直按照既定的政策指引──即《檢控政策及常規》──處理檢控工作，並只會對有合理機會達至定罪的案件進行檢控。此外，對案件提出檢控的先決條件，是檢控必須符合公眾利益。我們一直以公正、獨立和客觀的態度作出檢控決定。律政司會一直並繼續確保刑事檢察工作不受任何干涉。",
            "律政司竭力秉持長久以來的承諾，公平和有效地執行刑事司法制度，以維護香港市民的利益。為了達致上述目標，律政司向來非常重視與法律界合作，從而提高刑事司法服務質素。私人執業的大律師及律師經常受聘代表律政司執行檢控工作，正是我們與業界的夥伴合作關係的一個例證。",
            "此外，刑事檢控科去年舉辦了多個研討會，包括在去年十一月舉行「刑事法律研討會」，以刑事司法制度的改革為主題，讓司法機構與法律界（包括本地及國際層面）的翹楚聚首香港，討論重要的刑事法律議題。",
            "另外，刑事檢控科於上月主辦第十二屆檢察機關首長會議，議題為「當今檢控服務的挑戰：與時並進」。來自多個普通法及相關司法管轄區的檢察機關首長在香港聚首一堂，聚焦討論目前的趨勢及相關議題，以及當今檢控機關所面對的挑戰。在會議期間，刑事檢控科邀請多名司法機構人員和法律界人士參與其中一些活動，以提供機會進行有用的交流和討論。",
            "刑事檢控科致力推行持續法律教育，其中一項措施，是邀請法律界人士參與該科舉辦的培訓課程。自二○一一年起，該科一直與大律師公會及律師會合作，為新近取得執業資格並有意為律政司執行檢控工作的大律師及律師舉辦培訓課程。一如今年初我向立法會司法及法律事務委員會匯報，基於過去的聯合培訓計劃成效理想，我們會定期舉辦課程，這樣既可令年資較淺的大律師及律師的專業水平進一步有所提升，也可提高整體檢控服務質素。",
            "剛才我講述了我們為提升刑事司法服務質素所付出的種種努力，但若然我們不能贏取市民對刑事司法制度的信心及支持，這些努力也是徒然。要取信於市民，提高檢控工作和常規的透明度，正是箇中關鍵所在。為此，刑事檢控科繼續每年發表工作回顧，向市民詳細交代過去一年所遇到的挑戰和取得的成果。此外，刑事檢控科也就多個廣受關注的刑事司法制度議題，積極與相關人士或團體交換意見，務使刑事司法制度更加公開透明，並與所服務的社會大眾保持更緊密的溝通。",
            "檢控週２０１３重介紹社會上個人和團體在維護法治方面可擔當的角色。我很好興見到參與今天開幕典禮的人士，不但有法律界和執法機關的代表，還有檢控制度所服務的不同界別代表。除是次開幕典禮外，檢控週亦已安排多項趣味與資訊兼備的活動，例如學校講座、導賞參觀，以及攝影和海報比賽等。透過這些活動，公眾人士不但會對刑事檢控科的工作和如何作出檢控決定，有更多的了解；更重要的是，他們可明白作為市民在推展刑事司法工作方面可擔當的角色。",
            "最後，謹多謝大律師公會和律師會鼎力支持檢控週２０１３。我亦希望藉此機會向刑事檢控專員薛偉成資深大律師及其他協助籌辦是次檢控週２０１３的同事，表達謝意。這個項目是能夠成功舉辦，全是他們的努力成果。",
            "最後，我現在宣布檢控週２０１３正式開展。多謝各位。",
