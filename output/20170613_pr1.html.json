            "Mediation enables parties to resolve disputes in an amicable and constructive manner and with the help of mediators, parties concerned can reach a mutually acceptable solution with controlled risks, costs and time, noted the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, today (June 13).",
            "Speaking at the \"Mediate First\" Pledge Reception 2017 organised by the Department of Justice (DoJ) today, Mr Yuen said that the Government has been committed to promoting the development of mediation in Hong Kong.",
            "With a view to further promoting the use of mediation in resolving disputes, the DoJ also held for the first time the Mediate First Pledge Logo & Star Logo Competition for Secondary School Students this year. Enthusiastic responses were received with some 250 entries.",
            "The winning designs of the Mediate First Pledge Logo and Star Logos will be used in the Mediate First Pledge Star Logo Award Scheme (Award Scheme). Under the Award Scheme, pledgees can display the Logo, as a notable symbol of \"Mediate First\" Pledge, at their shops or adopt the Logo in their letterheads. Moreover, pledgees who take part in promoting or supporting mediation to resolve dispute, will be awarded a Star Logo at the next Mediate First Pledge event. Pledgees' involvement can take various forms which include resolving disputes by mediation, inclusion of mediation clauses in contracts, and handling of customer complaints by mediation techniques. Details of the Award Scheme will be announced later.",
            "Mr Yuen thanked the Education Bureau, the Hong Kong Subsidised Secondary Schools Council, the Grant Schools Council and the Hong Kong Direct Subsidy Scheme Schools Council for their assistance in the Mediate First Pledge Logo & Star Logo Competition for Secondary School Students, which was carried out smoothly.",
            "Looking ahead, Mr Yuen pointed out that the DoJ would continue to actively promote the development of mediation in Hong Kong and hope to see the enactment of the Apology Bill as soon as possible, as well as the amendment of the Mediation Ordinance to clarify that third party funding of mediation is permitted under Hong Kong law.",
            "\"The DoJ will also look forward to the construction of mediation facilities adjacent to the new West Kowloon Law Courts Building and the implementation of a pilot mediation scheme for resolving suitable Small Claims Tribunal cases and other appropriate types of disputes,\" he said.",
            "Also speaking at the reception, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal of the High Court, Mr Justice Johnson Lam Man-hon, noted that the purpose of promoting \"Mediate First\" was to encourage different organisations and the commercial sector to first consider resolving disputes by mediation instead of court litigation.",
            "\"Resolving disputes by mediation is more time-saving and economical than court litigations. It can also greatly reduce the pressure faced by the parties in continued disputes, including emotional distress. As mediation agreement is reached by the parties with the assistance of mediators, the agreement must be readily recognised and accepted by the parties. It will also allow more flexibility and satisfy the needs of the parties than judgments handed down by the court. Therefore, mediation can help maintain amicable relationships between the parties,\" Mr Justice Lam said.",
            "Among the pledgees of the \"Mediate First\" Pledge, about 60 representatives of chambers of commerce, companies and organisations attended the signing ceremony of the \"Mediate First\" Pledge during the reception today, pledging to consider mediation first as a means to resolve disputes.",
            "More than 300 representatives of international enterprise private companies, public bodies, business associations and professional bodies, as well as professionals in the legal and mediation sectors joined the \"Mediate First\" Pledge reception.",
            "In addition, the DoJ held a seminar on mediation earlier this afternoon to promote the use of mediation in a wide range of disputes, including commercial (such as intellectual property rights and cross-border trade disputes) and community disputes (such as disputes related to building management, consumer, peer and family); and to let the participants know more about the differences and characteristics of facilitative mediation and evaluative mediation. About 500 people attended the seminar.",

            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月十三日）表示，調解能讓爭議各方以友好和有建設性的方式解決爭議，透過調解員協助，締造雙方接納的解決方案，同時能控制風險、費用和需投放的時間。",
            "袁國強在律政司舉辦的2017年「調解為先」承諾書招待會上致辭時說，政府一直致力推動調解發展。",
            "為進一步推動以調解解決爭議，律政司今年新設「調解為先」承諾書中學生徽號及星徽設計比賽。比賽反應良好，律政司共收到近250份參賽作品。",
            "透過該比賽選出的「調解為先」承諾書徽號及星徽設計，將用於「調解為先」承諾書星徽獎勵計劃。在這計劃下，承諾人可在其商舖及信箋等展示「調解為先」承諾書徽號，作為「調解為先」承諾書的鮮明標記。此外，對一些以實際行動推動或支持以調解解決爭議的承諾人，在下一次「調解為先」承諾書活動中，將獲頒發一枚星徽。實際行動包括以調解方式解決爭議、在合約中加入調解條款、以調解技巧處理顧客投訴等。獎勵計劃詳情，會於稍後公布。",
            "袁國強感謝教育局、香港津貼中學議會、補助學校議會和香港直接資助學校議會對「調解為先」承諾書中學生徽號及星徽設計比賽的鼎力支持，使比賽得以順利進行。",
            "展望將來，袁國強指出律政司會繼續積極地推動調解在香港發展，並希望爭取《道歉條例草案》早日獲得通過，並修訂《調解條例》，以釐清香港法律准許第三者資助調解。",
            "他說：「律政司亦希望在新近啓用的西九龍法院鄰近用地興建調解設施及落實調解先導計劃，處理合適的小額錢債審裁處案件，以及其他合適的爭議。」",
            "高等法院上訴法庭副庭長林文瀚法官在同一場合致辭時指出，推動「調解為先」的目的，是希望鼓勵不同的機構及商界人士在遇到紛爭時，會先考慮用調解來解決爭議，避免訴諸法庭。",
            "他說︰「調解比一般法庭審訊既省時，又符合經濟效益，同時亦大大減少訴訟各方在持續爭議中所承受的壓力，包括精神上的困擾。由於和解協議是由爭議各方在調解員的幫助下共同協商的結果，該方案必然是他們較容易認同且接受的選擇，比法庭強制加諸的判決更富彈性及更能照顧各方當事人的個別需要，因此，調解亦可以維持彼此之間的良好關係。」",
            "在衆多「調解為先承諾書」簽署者中，有約六十個商會、公司和機構的代表出席招待會的「調解為先承諾書」簽署儀式，承諾會先考慮以調解解決爭議。",
            "「調解為先承諾書」招待會由律政司舉辦，超過三百名來自跨國企業私人公司、公營機構、商會和專業團體等的代表，以及法律和調解專業人員出席招待會。",
            "為使出席者認識到調解有助解決廣泛種類的爭議，包括商事上（例如知識產權和跨境貿易的爭議），及社區層面的各種糾紛（例如物業管理、消費、朋輩和家事糾紛），以及認識促進式調解及評估式調解的不同及持點，律政司今日較早前舉行了一場「調解為先」研討會，共有約五百人出席。",
