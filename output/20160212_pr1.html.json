            "Following is the transcript of remarks made by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at a media session this morning (February 12):",
            "Reporter: Mr Yuen, do you think that this so-called \"Fishball Revolution\" is a challenge to Hong Kong's rule of law? And secondly, what's the difference between riot and unlawful assembly in legal terms?",
            "Secretary for Justice: I think just to deal with the last question, as I was just saying in Cantonese, riot has been defined quite clearly in the Public Order Ordinance. So if you are interested, you can see the definitions in the Public Order Ordinance yourself.",
            "Back to the first part of your question, you mentioned the expression \"Fishball Revolution\". If I may also take this opportunity to perhaps clarify a few points. I've seen reports both in Chinese as well as in English and I've seen local and also international media describing this event as \"Fishball Revolution\" or in similar expressions. And there are also suggestions that the whole incident was caused by the activities of regulating illegal hawking. I'm afraid this may not be a very accurate way of describing the incident. I think you would have recalled (the Secretary for Food and Health) Dr Ko Wing-man has already mentioned and explained in public that in fact on that occasion, it was because of certain colleagues dealing with illegal hawking got injured and that's why they called for police assistance. So it's got nothing to do with the operations concerning illegal hawking. And in any event, as I was stressing earlier in Cantonese, that the court has set it very clearly, including our Court of Final Appeal, that irrespective of your political motive, irrespective of your political opinion, the way to express your views, the way to express your political opinion has to be lawful. And I think everyone would agree that unlawful violence would not be the appropriate way to express one's political demand and political motive.",
            "And therefore I would also make use of this opportunity to make an appeal to everyone in Hong Kong that I think the majority of people in Hong Kong would love to have a peaceful Hong Kong and I don't think anyone in Hong Kong would love to see such kind of violent act. And that's why, as I was saying in Cantonese just now, the Department of Justice takes this matter very seriously. We will work closely with the Police, we will scrutinise the evidence and we would decide whether there are other charges that we need to consider from now until the 7th of April. As I was saying just now, we do not exclude the possibility that we might need to add further charges to those defendants. Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（二月十二日）上午與傳媒的談話內容：",
            "律政司司長：各位傳媒朋友早晨。我想大家也知道在年初二大約凌晨時候發生的事件，昨日在法庭已有三十七名被告正式被起訴。今日據我理解應該再有另外三位人士會正式被起訴。今次的事件非常特殊，大家在電視也看到，我不知道大家（傳媒）會否在現場，也看到情況非常混亂，亦有很多警員受到襲擊，大家亦知道很多警員受傷。我們律政司非常非常重視今次事件，我們律政司刑事檢控科的同事將會繼續與警方相關人士保持緊密的聯絡，亦會審視由警方交給我們、提供給我們的證據和相關的資料。昨日上庭的三十七名被告將會於四月七日再次到法庭。由現在到四月七日，我們刑事檢控科的同事將會與警方一起研究相關證據，以及決定是否有需要就個別的被告加控其他的刑事罪行，現階段我們不可以排除有個別的被告將會被加控其他罪行。",
            "我亦希望在此強調，今次的事件對香港的法治是一個嚴重的挑戰，法庭包括我們的終審庭說得很清楚，無論是有任何政治訴求，所有人表達其政治訴求時亦不可以用違法的行為，我相信更加不可以用一些暴力，或是大家在今次事件裏看到的那麼暴力和不理智行為，更不是法律所容許的。我再次強調，無論有任何訴求也不應該用犯法，包括暴力、非法暴力的方式去表達，所以今次我們非常重視這次事件。",
            "記者：暴動的控罪和入罪的因素是甚麼？是參與了才算暴動？還是在現場已算是？",
            "律政司司長：暴動這控罪在法例上其實已非常清楚，若這位朋友有興趣，可以看看《公安條例》。其實非法集結，如何由非法集結演變為暴動，法例上說得非常清楚。今次現階段用了暴動來起訴，原因是，如我剛才所講，大家在電視上也看到，事件的嚴重性跟以前的非常不同。我亦有留意到有報道指暴動這個控罪非常少用，我想大家也可以了解到，正正表明今次事件在香港亦很少發生。我相信由九七（年）到現在，大家記憶中也沒有一次遊行或示威演變成當晚的情況。亦因如此，昨日的三十七名被告和今日的若干人士將會或已被控告暴動。但正如我剛才所說，由現在至四月七日，我們律政司刑事檢控科的同事會繼續審視警方提供的資料，我們不排除會加控其他的控罪。",
            "記者：但條例說是擾亂社會安寧便算暴動，這樣清晰嗎？究竟怎樣才是擾亂社會安寧，界線如何劃分？或者往後會如何界定界線？政府當中是否有政治考慮？是否有壓力，是否ＣＹ（行政長官）定性了這一次是暴動，所以控告他們暴動罪？考慮的因素是甚麼？",
            "律政司司長：我相信，我以前也說過，我希望今次再重申，近這一、兩年我看到很多的報道，或很多不同人士動輒便把政治的議題和檢控聯繫起來，亦動輒便說在決定檢控時有政治考慮，我希望大家不要再在沒有任何基礎下便動輒作這類推測。我們做檢控的決定時，我們說得很清楚，以前刑事檢控專員亦說得很清楚，我們做檢控時是會根據刑事檢控的守則。",
            "今次警方用暴動的控罪起訴相關人士，我剛才也說，我們將會繼續與警方保持緊密的聯絡去審視有關的證據。我可以在此跟大家說，絕對沒有任何政治的考慮。我亦在此重申，不希望大家往往用政治考慮來為一些很明顯是違法的行為作掩飾，當然最終決定這件事是否屬於暴動或是有違反其他的刑事法律，我們將會交給法庭處理，所以每宗個案當中的細節，我在此不作評論，因為相關的司法程序已展開。但我希望在此再次重申，不希望大家動輒便說有政治理由，不是因為誰說了些甚麼，最重要最終我們還是看相關的證據。我希望大家也可以問問自己，由九七（年）到現在，或在過去十年、二十年，有否見過當晚發生的事件？若大家說是有的，我希望大家可以告訴我，亦正正是如此罕有我們才用暴動這控罪。",
