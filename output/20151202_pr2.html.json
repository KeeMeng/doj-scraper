            "Following is a question by the Dr Hon Elizabeth Quat and a reply by Solicitor General, Mr Wesley Wong, SC (in the absence of the Secretary for Justice), in the Legislative Council today (December 2):",
            "Question:",
            "Some concern groups for women's interests have pointed out that the investigation process and trial proceedings of sexual offence cases have caused embarrassment and humiliation to quite a number of the victims concerned, thus making them feel being \"assaulted a second time\". For instance, the attitude and behaviour of police officers often make the victims feel disrespected, and the victims are tormented by repeated demands to retell the course of their traumas. Moreover, when the victims give evidence during court proceedings, they are often questioned on their sexual experience and they are not provided with any privacy protection measures, which makes them extremely distressed. Besides, the existing legislation on sexual offences overlooks the possibility of the victim being a male. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether the authorities will enhance the training for police officers on the skills of and knowledge in handling sexual offence cases, and consider referring sexual offence cases involving adult victims to a dedicated investigation team, with reference to the handling of the cases of sexual abuse of children;",
            "(2) given that section 154 of the Crimes Ordinance provides that except with the leave of the judge, no evidence and no question in cross-examination shall be adduced or asked at the trial, by or on behalf of any defendant at the trial, about any sexual experience of a complainant with a person other than that defendant, whether the authorities will draw up detailed guidelines to state clearly the circumstances under which the judge may grant such leave; whether the authorities will extend the definition of \"witness in fear\" in the Criminal Procedure Ordinance to cover all victims in sexual offence cases so that live television link is provided for them on a mandatory basis in giving evidence; whether the authorities will consider amending the relevant legislation to stipulate that in order to protect the privacy of victims in sexual offence cases, the court must shield such victims behind screens when they give evidence and provide special passageways for them to enter and leave the court; and",
            "(3) given that the consultation paper on Rape and Other Non-consensual Sexual Offences published by the Law Reform Commission in 2012 recommended that any reform of the substantive law on sexual offences should be guided by a set of guiding principles, including gender neutrality and avoidance of distinctions based on sexual orientation, whether the authorities have plans to carry out reforms on the laws on sexual offences based on those guiding principles; if they do, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "The reply of the Department of Justice (DoJ) to the three-part question raised by the Dr Hon Elizabeth Quat is as follows:",
            "(1) According to information provided by the Security Bureau, the Police attach great importance to professionalism in handling sexual offence cases, and the provision of relevant training to frontline officers. To enhance their skills and professional sensitivity in handling sexual violence cases, the Police have introduced various measures, including requiring recruit police constables and probationary inspectors to take an additional training session on professional sensitivity in handling victims in sexual violence cases since March this year.",
            "The Police also review from time to time the handling procedures and the use of resources for handling sexual violence cases. Cases are assigned to suitable criminal investigation teams for investigation, having regard to their complexity and seriousness, to ensure effective investigation and delivery of services that meet the needs of victims. At this stage, the Police have not considered setting up designated teams to handle the investigation of sexual violence cases.",
            "In terms of procedural arrangements, the Police will make every possible effort to provide reasonable protection to the privacy of complainants in sexual offences and to reduce their embarrassment and stress. Upon receipt of a report, the Police will arrange for a same sex police officer with relevant training to interview the sexual violence victim, and will try their best to avoid further traumatic experience arising from the investigation process. Moreover, the investigating officers will introduce the victims to crisis intervention services provided by non-governmental organisations and may make appropriate case referrals.",
            "(2) According to section 154(1) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), if at a trial before the Court of First Instance any person is for the time being charged with an offence of rape or indecent assault to which he pleads not guilty, then, except with the leave of the judge, no evidence and no question in cross-examination shall be adduced or asked at the trial, by or on behalf of any defendant at the trial, about any sexual experience of a complainant with a person other than that defendant. Section 154(2) continues to specify that the judge shall give leave only on an application made by or on behalf of a defendant, and only if he is satisfied that it would be unfair to that defendant to refuse to allow the evidence to be adduced or the question to be asked. Since such decisions are judicial decisions based on the actual evidence and defence in individual cases, the Judiciary considers it inappropriate to formulate detailed instructions lest they will restrict judicial discretion or give rise to unfairness.",
            "The provision of screens or special passageways for victims of sexual violence in criminal proceedings is currently governed by common law and is a matter left to a judge's discretion. As for the arrangement for victims to give evidence by live television link, it is governed by section 79B of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap. 221). The court will carefully consider such an application by the prosecution, and the views of the defendant, with due regard to the facts of the case and the needs of the complainant, before deciding whether to adopt any special measure(s). Based on their need, the victims concerned can apply to the judge for the adoption of the above-mentioned special measures.",
            "As the department responsible for criminal prosecution in Hong Kong, DoJ has a duty to safeguard the fairness and equity of the criminal justice system. Our prosecutors respect the rights of crime victims and witnesses at all times. On the one hand, we protect the fundamental right of defendants to a fair trial, and at the same time, we treat victims and witnesses with compassion and understanding, encouraging and facilitating them to testify in court. To this end, the current Prosecution Code specifically includes a chapter on the handling of victims of crime and vulnerable witnesses, reminding prosecutors that they should have regard to The Victims of Crime Charter and the Prosecutions Division's The Statement on the Treatment of Victims and the Witnesses, and attend to and address the special needs of the persons concerned. The Prosecution Code also sets out in detail the possible protection that may be considered to be provided to victims and witnesses. The Prosecutions Division will also make suitable application to the court for a victim or witness who has a need for special arrangements for testifying in court.",
            "Dr Hon Quat requested providing in the law that the arrangement for the use of shield, live television link in giving evidence and the provision of special passageways should be provided to victims of sexual crime automatically. Under section 79B of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, where a witness in fear is to give evidence in proceedings in respect of any offence, the court may, on application or on its own motion, permit the person to give evidence by way of a live television link, subject to such conditions as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.",
            "The proposals put up by the Dr Hon Quat (in particular those that would debar the defendant and his counsel from seeing the witness's response, etc.) would involve the fundamental right of a defendant to a fair trial, and also concern the public interest in open justice. They may also deprive the judge of his discretion, and the complainants of their choice, in respect of the adoption of special measures, and hence should be handled with care. Any legislative measures that we take to protect complainants in sexual offence cases must be reasonable and proportionate to the case in question.",
            "According to our understanding, the Judiciary has recently issued drafts of amended or new Practice Directions of relevance to stakeholders for consultation. After the implementation of the proposed change, the consideration of the need for screens as shields will become a standing procedure in every sexual offence case. According to the Judiciary's plan, it will consider promulgating the Practice Directions in early 2016, after having considered the comments of the stakeholders.",
            "(3) The Review of Sexual Offences Sub-committee of the Law Reform Commission has commenced a large-scale comprehensive review of the sexual offences in Hong Kong and related consultation which consists of four stages, with a view to ultimately preparing and issuing one global report. The first stage consultation has been undertaken. However, to discuss whether the Government has any plan to carry out reforms on law on sexual offences based on a set of guiding principles (including gender neutrality and the avoidance of distinctions based on sexual orientation) would be premature prior to the completion of the four-stage consultation and the final report.",

            "以下是今日（十二月二日）在立法會會議上葛珮帆議員的提問和法律政策專員黃惠沖資深大律師（在律政司司長缺席期間）的答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "有關注婦女權益的團體指出，性罪行案件的調查及審訊過程令不少受害人感到難堪及被羞辱，以致他們感到受「二次傷害」。例如，警務人員的態度及行為往往令受害人感到不受尊重，而受害人因多次被要求覆述遇害過程而飽受煎熬。此外，受害人在法庭上作證時，很多時被盤問性經驗及未獲提供保護私隱的措施，令他們極度難堪。再者，現行有關性罪行的法例忽略男性成為受害人的可能性。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）當局會否加強培訓警務人員處理性罪行案件的技巧和知識，以及考慮參考性虐待兒童案件的處理方式，把成年受害人的性罪行案件交由調查組專責處理；",
            "（二）鑑於《刑事罪行條例》第154條訂明，除非獲得法官的許可，否則在該審訊過程中任何被告人或其代表不得提出有關申訴人與被告人以外的其他人的性經驗的證據，或在盤問中提出有關此事的問題，當局會否制訂詳細指引，清楚訂明法官可在哪些情況下給予該項許可；當局會否擴大《刑事訴訟程序條例》中「在恐懼中的證人」的定義，涵蓋所有性罪行受害人，以強制提供電視直播聯繫予受害人在作證時使用；當局會否考慮修改有關的法例，訂明法庭須為作證的性罪行受害人設置屏風以作遮蔽、以及提供特別通道進出法庭，以保障受害人的私隱；及",
            "（三）鑑於法律改革委員會於二○一二年發表題為「強姦及其他未經同意下進行的性罪行」的諮詢文件，建議當局就對性罪行的實體法律進行任何改革時，應該依據一套指導原則進行（包括無分性別及避免基於性傾向而作出區別），當局有否計劃按該等指導原則進行性罪行法律改革；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "就葛珮帆議員提問的三部分，律政司的回覆如下﹕",
            "（一）根據保安局提供的資料，警方非常重視對性暴力案件的專業處理及前線人員的相關培訓。警方已推出多項措施，提升警務人員處理性暴力案件的技巧及專業敏感度，包括自今年三月起，新入職的學警及見習督察須額外修習一個有關處理性暴力受害人的專業敏感度的課節。",
            "警隊亦不時檢討處理性暴力案件的程序及資源運用情況，並會因應案件的複雜和嚴重程度，指派合適的刑偵隊伍進行調查，以確保調查工作的效率和提供的服務切合受害人的需要。警方現階段未有考慮設立指定隊伍調查性暴力罪案。",
            "在程序安排方面，警方會盡可能令性罪行投訴人的私隱受合理保障和減輕受害人的難堪及壓力。接獲舉報後，警方會安排接受過相關訓練的相同性別警務人員會見性暴力案件的受害人，並會盡力避免因調查工作而令受害人再次受到創傷。此外，調查人員會向受害人介紹由非政府機構提供的危機介入服務，並可作適當的轉介。",
            "（二）根據《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）第154（1）條的規定，在原訟法庭席前進行的審訊中，如任何人當其時被控犯強姦罪行或猥褻侵犯而不認罪，除非獲得法官的許可，否則在該審訊中任何被告人或其代表不得提出有關申訴人與該被告人以外的其他人的性經驗的證據，或在盤問中提出有關此事的問題。而接續在第154（2）條指明，法官僅可以因應被告人或其代表的申請，而且是限於法官如信納拒絕容許被告人或其代表提出該等證據或問題會對被告人不公平時，方可給予許可。由於有關決定屬司法決定，視乎個別案件的實際證據和辯護情況等，司法機構認為不宜制訂詳細指示，以免使司法酌情決定權受到限制，或引致不公平的情況。",
            "在刑事訴訟程序中為性暴力受害者安排使用屏障或特別通道，現時是受普通法規管，由法官酌情決定。至於安排受害者透過視像系統作供，則受《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）第79B條規管。法庭會在顧及案情及申訴人的需要下，審慎考慮控方的申請及被告人的取態，決定是否採取特別措施。有關受害人可按其需要向法官申請使用上述特別措施。",
            "作為負責刑事檢控的部門，律政司會確保刑事司法制度公平公正。檢控人員一貫尊重罪行受害者和證人的權利，一方面保障被告人能獲得公平審訊的基本權利，同時體恤受害者和證人，鼓勵和便利他們出庭作供。為此，現行的《檢控守則》特別包含有關處理罪行受害者及易受傷害證人的章節，提醒檢控人員應參考《罪行受害者約章》和刑事檢控科發表的《對待受害者及證人的陳述書》，關注和處理有關人士的特別需要。《檢控守則》亦詳細列出可考慮對受害者及證人提供的保障。刑事檢控科亦會為在作供時需要特別安排的受害人或證人向法庭提出適當的申請。",
            "葛議員要求立法訂明性罪行受害人可自動獲得提供屏障、透過視像系統作供及提供特別通道等安排。根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第79B條，凡一名在恐懼中的證人將在就任何罪行進行的法律程序中提供證據，法庭可應申請或主動准許該人藉電視直播聯繫方式提供證據，並可施加法庭認為在有關情況下屬恰當的條件規限。",
            "葛議員的建議（特別是令被告人及其律師看不見受害人或證人作供時的反應等）涉及被告人獲公平審訊的基本權利，及有關司法公開的公眾利益，亦可能會令法官及性罪行受害人分別失去應否採用特別措施的酌情權及選擇權，須小心處理。我們就保護性罪行申訴人所採取的任何立法措施，必須是合理和與案情相稱。",
            "據悉，司法機構已於最近向有關持份者發出經修訂或新的相關實務指示的擬稿，以供考慮。有關的建議修訂落實後，在每宗性罪行案件中，常規程序之一是考慮是否須要使用屏障以作遮蔽。據司法機構預期，於考慮有關持份者的意見後，將考慮在二○一六年年初頒布實務指示。",
            "（三）法律改革委員會性罪行檢討小組委員會已開始進行香港的性罪行大規模的全面檢討及相關的四期諮詢。首期諮詢已於先前進行，最後會擬備及發表一份整體性的報告書。然而，在全部四期諮詢及最後報告書完成前討論當局有否計劃按一套指導原則（包括無分性別及避免基於性傾向而作出區別）進行性罪行法律改革實屬言之尚早。",

            "（二）根據《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）第154（1）條的規定，在原訟法庭席前進行的審訊中，如任何人當其時被控犯強姦罪行或猥褻侵犯而不認罪，除非獲得法官的許可，否則在該審訊中任何被告人或其代表不得提出有關申訴人與該被告人以外的其他人的性經驗的證據，或在盤問中提出有關此事的問題",
            "而接續在第154（2）條指明，法官僅可以因應被告人或其代表的申請，而且是限於法官如信納拒絕容許被告人或其代表提出該等證據或問題會對被告人不公平時，方可給予許可",
            "由於有關決定屬司法決定，視乎個別案件的實際證據和辯護情況等，司法機構認為不宜制訂詳細指示，以免使司法酌情決定權受到限制，或引致不公平的情況",
            "在刑事訴訟程序中為性暴力受害者安排使用屏障或特別通道，現時是受普通法規管，由法官酌情決定",
            "至於安排受害者透過視像系統作供，則受《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）第79B條規管",
            "法庭會在顧及案情及申訴人的需要下，審慎考慮控方的申請及被告人的取態，決定是否採取特別措施",
            "有關受害人可按其需要向法官申請使用上述特別措施",
            "作為負責刑事檢控的部門，律政司會確保刑事司法制度公平公正",
            "檢控人員一貫尊重罪行受害者和證人的權利，一方面保障被告人能獲得公平審訊的基本權利，同時體恤受害者和證人，鼓勵和便利他們出庭作供",
            "為此，現行的《檢控守則》特別包含有關處理罪行受害者及易受傷害證人的章節，提醒檢控人員應參考《罪行受害者約章》和刑事檢控科發表的《對待受害者及證人的陳述書》，關注和處理有關人士的特別需要",
            "《檢控守則》亦詳細列出可考慮對受害者及證人提供的保障",
            "刑事檢控科亦會為在作供時需要特別安排的受害人或證人向法庭提出適當的申請",
            "葛議員要求立法訂明性罪行受害人可自動獲得提供屏障、透過視像系統作供及提供特別通道等安排",
            "根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第79B條，凡一名在恐懼中的證人將在就任何罪行進行的法律程序中提供證據，法庭可應申請或主動准許該人藉電視直播聯繫方式提供證據，並可施加法庭認為在有關情況下屬恰當的條件規限",
            "葛議員的建議（特別是令被告人及其律師看不見受害人或證人作供時的反應等）涉及被告人獲公平審訊的基本權利，及有關司法公開的公眾利益，亦可能會令法官及性罪行受害人分別失去應否採用特別措施的酌情權及選擇權，須小心處理",
            "我們就保護性罪行申訴人所採取的任何立法措施，必須是合理和與案情相稱",
            "據悉，司法機構已於最近向有關持份者發出經修訂或新的相關實務指示的擬稿，以供考慮",
            "有關的建議修訂落實後，在每宗性罪行案件中，常規程序之一是考慮是否須要使用屏障以作遮蔽",
            "據司法機構預期，於考慮有關持份者的意見後，將考慮在二○一六年年初頒布實務指示",
            "（三）法律改革委員會性罪行檢討小組委員會已開始進行香港的性罪行大規模的全面檢討及相關的四期諮詢",
            "首期諮詢已於先前進行，最後會擬備及發表一份整體性的報告書",
            "然而，在全部四期諮詢及最後報告書完成前討論當局有否計劃按一套指導原則（包括無分性別及避免基於性傾向而作出區別）進行性罪行法律改革實屬言之尚早",
