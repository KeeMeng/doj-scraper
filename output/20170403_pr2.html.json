            "Following are the speaking notes of the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, tabled at the Finance Committee special meeting in the Legislative Council today (April 3):",
            "Chairman,",
            "For 2017-18, the total estimated expenditure of the Department of Justice (DoJ) is about $1,972 million, which represents an increase of about 24.8 per cent (or around $390 million) over the revised estimated expenditure for the last financial year (i.e. 2016-17), but a decrease of about 12 per cent (or around $270 million) over the original estimated expenditure for the last financial year. The changes relate mainly to two major aspects:",
            "First, there will be an increase in manpower, with the filling of vacancies which could not be filled previously and a net creation of 32 posts to cope with the increasing demand of government departments for legal services and operation need for manpower.",
            "The second aspect is the expenditure on court costs and expenses payable to barristers, solicitors and other professionals in private practice to be engaged. Court costs and briefing out expenditures are mainly dependent on the number of cases involved, their complexity and development. The estimated expenditure in this regard for each year is worked out on the basis of information available at the time of preparing the estimates and the principles of prudent management of public finances. However, the ultimate amount to be incurred will depend on the development and outcome of the judicial proceedings concerned. In view of the latest status of the relevant cases, we have reduced the 2016-17 revised estimates for court costs and briefing-out expenses by 65 per cent and 47.6 per cent respectively. For this reason, when comparing the estimates for the coming year with the substantially reduced revised estimates of last year, it may superficially create the impression that there is a significant increase. However, when compared with the original estimates of last year, the estimates for court costs and briefing-out expenses for the coming year have actually been reduced by 44.7 per cent and 11.5 per cent respectively.",
            "I will now outline the DoJ's major areas of work in the new financial year.",
            "Programme (1) – Prosecutions",
            "In the context of criminal prosecutions, we will need to handle the prosecution of cases arising from the \"Occupy Movement\" and the \"Mong Kok Incidents\" in the coming year; coupled with all the other criminal cases which will have to be handled in the normal course, the workload of the Prosecutions Division will remain very heavy. Colleagues of the Division will continue to handle prosecution works in a fair, impartial and apolitical manner, strictly according to the Prosecution Code and the relevant law and evidence.",
            "To cope with the heavy workload, we will provide resources for the Prosecutions Division to create an additional 8 Government Counsel posts and 2 Senior Government Counsel posts in the coming year so as to strengthen support for handling cases related to proceeds of crime, implementing the Trade Descriptions (Unfair Trade Practices)(Amendment) Ordinance and legal advisory work. This will also allow counsel in the Prosecutions Division to have more opportunities to appear in court for prosecution work so as to refine their advocacy expertise, thereby further strengthening our prosecution team.",
            "Enhancing public understanding of the criminal justice system of Hong Kong and promoting public awareness of the rule of law remain one of the key focuses of our work ahead. In this regard, we will continue to organise events such as the \"Meet the Community\" and the \"Prosecution Week\" so as to keep in touch with the public.",
            "Programme (2) – Civil",
            "The Civil Division will continue to provide legal services in civil law matters to all government departments, including the provision of legal advice to ensure that the Government's policies, legislation and administrative measures are in compliance with the Basic Law and other applicable laws. At the same time, the Division is responsible for handling all civil and related proceedings involving the Government.",
            "The Mediation Team of the Civil Division will continue to support the Steering Committee on Mediation in implementing the policy for the promotion and development of mediation in Hong Kong. Major initiatives include:",
            "(1) the construction of mediation facilities near the West Kowloon Law Courts Building and the implementation of a pilot mediation scheme at these facilities for resolving suitable Small Claims Tribunal cases and other appropriate types of disputes;",
            "(2) to continue to explore, in consultation with the Steering Committee on Mediation and other stakeholders, the infrastructure to be put in place for using evaluative mediation to resolve intellectual property and other appropriate types of disputes in Hong Kong;",
            "(3) to push for the enactment of the Apology Bill as soon as possible so as to facilitate the amicable resolution of disputes; and",
            "(4) to organise another Mediate First Pledge event to promote and encourage greater understanding and use of mediation by different sectors to resolve different types of disputes.",
            "Programme (3) – Legal Policy",
            "The Legal Policy Division will continue to discharge the important role to uphold the rule of law by providing legal support to government departments on the Basic Law, human rights and constitutional matters.",
            "Over the years, the DoJ has striven to enhance Hong Kong's status as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region. We will continue to work with all stakeholders to promote relevant Hong Kong services in the Mainland and overseas, including countries in the Asia-Pacific region as well as those along the Belt and Road.",
            "Besides, the DoJ will also endeavour to enhance the legal framework for dispute resolution. We introduced two amendment bills in end 2016 and early 2017 relating to arbitration and mediation respectively to clarify the arbitrability of intellectual property disputes and to allow third party funding for arbitration or mediation. We look forward to the early completion of the legislative process so as to further promote Hong Kong as a leading dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region.",
            "Programme (4) – Law Drafting",
            "The objective of the Law Drafting Division is to prepare legislation that accurately reflects the policy intent and is easy to comprehend. This term of the Government plans to introduce a number of important bills into the Legislative Council before July 2017. The Law Drafting Division will provide the necessary professional drafting service. We will also continue to provide training to our law drafters to further their professional development.",
            "Besides, the new electronic legislation database known as \"Hong Kong e-Legislation\" was launched on February 24. While many members of the public have expressed satisfaction with the functions of the new system, we are aware of technical issues encountered by some users. We are working on the resolution of those issues with the contractor and will continue to improve the system to meet the needs of users.",
            "Programme (5) – International Law",
            "The International Law Division has been active in participating in the activities and conferences of international legal and related organisations, and in strengthening mutual co-operation. Such efforts include participation in a sub-group on strengthening economic and legal infrastructure (SELI) established under the Economic Committee of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). SELI was established in February 2015 and a counsel from the DoJ has assumed the role of its convenor. In February this year, SELI was made a permanent sub-group in recognition of its work.",
            "We will continue to strengthen co-operation with the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH), United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) through the APEC and other appropriate platforms. We hope such works can further enhance Hong Kong's status as an international legal services centre.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Chairman, the above is an outline of DoJ's major areas of work in the coming financial year. My colleagues and I will be happy to answer Members' questions and listen to your views. Thank you.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師提交予今日（四月三日）的立法會財務委員會特別會議的書面發言稿件全文︰",
            "主席：",
            "律政司在二○一七至一八年度的總預算開支大約為19億7 千200萬元，較上年度（即二○一六至一七年度）的修訂預算開支增加約24.8%（即大約3億9千萬元），但較上年度的原來預算開支則減少約12%（即大約2億7千萬元）。有關變動，主要牽涉兩大方面：",
            "首先是人手的增長。來年，我們會填補過去未能填補的職位空缺，以及淨計增設32個新職位以應付政府各部門對法律服務需求的增長及運作上的人手需要。",
            "第二方面是訴訟費用及向獲委聘的私人執業大律師、律師及其他專業人士支付的開支。訴訟費用及外判案件的開支金額，主要視乎相關案件的數目、複雜程度和進展而定。每年這方面的開支預算，是根據擬備預算時所掌握的資料及審慎理財的理念而制訂，但最終金額則取決於相關司法程序的發展和結果。鑑於有關案件的最新情況，我們將二○一六至一七年訴訟費用及外判案件開支的修訂預算分別調低65%及47.6%。若將來年的預算，與上年度大幅調低的修訂預算比較，表面上可能令人有大幅上升的感覺，但若與上年度的原來預算比較，來年的預算實際上已分別調低44.7%及11.5%。",
            "以下我會重點簡介律政司在新一個財政年度的工作重點。",
            "綱領（1）- 刑事檢控",
            "在刑事檢控方面，我們來年將繼續處理因「佔領行動」及「旺角事件」而衍生的案件；加上處理日常的各類不同的刑事案件，刑事檢控科的工作仍然會相當繁重。刑事檢控科的同事會繼續嚴格根據《檢控守則》、法律及證據，以公平、公正和非政治化的態度處理檢控工作。",
            "為應付繁重的工作，我們將會在來年提供資源，為刑事檢控科加開8個政府律師及兩個高級政府律師的職位，以加強處理犯罪得益相關案件、執行《商品說明（不良營商手法）（修訂）條例》及提供法律意見等工作提供支援，並令刑事檢控科的律師有更多機會出庭進行檢控工作，提升訟辯專長，從而進一步強化我們的檢控團隊。",
            "讓公眾更加理解香港的刑事制度及推廣法治精神，亦會繼續是我們的其中一個工作要點。我們會繼續舉辦「與公眾會面」及｢檢控週｣等活動，保持與社會大眾的溝通。",
            "綱領（2）- 民事法律",
            "民事法律科會繼續向政府各部門提供民事法律服務，包括提供法律意見，以確保政府的政策、制訂的法例和行政措施，均符合《基本法》及其他適用法律。同時亦會負責處理涉及政府的民事等相關司法程序。",
            "民事法律科轄下的調解小組會繼續支持調解督導委員會落實在香港提倡和發展調解的政策。主要工作包括:",
            "（一）在西九龍法院鄰近用地興建調解設施，及落實在上述地方實行調解先導計劃，處理合適的小額錢債審裁處案件，以及其他合適的爭議。",
            "（二）繼續諮詢調解督導委員會及其他持份者，探討在香港使用評估式調解所須的基礎建設，以解決知識產權及其他合適的爭議。",
            "（三）爭取《道歉條例草案》早日獲得通過，促進以和解方式排解爭端。",
            "（四）再次舉辦「調解為先」承諾書的活動，藉此推動各界更廣泛認識調解及使用調解去解決各類糾紛。",
            "綱領（3） - 法律政策",
            "法律政策科會繼續發揮維護法治的重要職能，就《基本法》、人權及政制等事宜，向政府各部門提供法律支援。",
            "律政司多年來致力鞏固香港作為亞太區的主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。我們會繼續與持份者合作，在內地與海外（包括亞太區和「一帶一路」沿線的國家）推廣香港的相關服務。",
            "律政司亦會致力優化爭議解決的法律框架。我們分別於去年底及今年初向立法會提交兩項有關仲裁和調解的修訂條例草案，分別旨在澄清知識產權爭議的可仲裁性，以及容許第三者資助仲裁或調解。我們期望相關立法工作能夠盡快完成，從而進一步推動香港成為亞太區的主要爭議解決中心。",
            "綱領（4）- 法律草擬",
            "法律草擬科的工作目標，是草擬能夠準確反映政策目的並且容易明白的法例。本屆政府計劃在今年七月之前，將若干重要的法案提交立法會，法律草擬科會提供所需的專業草擬服務。我們亦會繼續為法律草擬人員提供培訓，以促進專業發展。",
            "此外，名為「電子版香港法例」的全新的電子法例資料庫，已於二月二十四日啟用。很多公眾人士對新系統的功能表示滿意；但我們亦知悉部分使用者在使用新系統時，遇到一些技術問題。我們正與承判商努力處理這些問題，並會繼續改善新系統，以滿足使用者的需要。",
            "綱領（5）- 國際法律",
            "國際法律科一直積極參與國際法律及相關國際組織的活動和會議，並加強彼此的合作，當中包括參與亞太經合組織（APEC）經濟委員會下一個加強經濟和法律基建工作組。該工作組在二○一五年二月成立，召集人由律政司一名律師擔任。今年二月，該工作組獲經濟委員會通過成為一個永久工作組，反映其工作獲充分肯定。",
            "我們會繼續通過亞太經合組織及其他適當平台，加強與海牙國際私法會議（HCCH）、聯合國國際貿易法委員會（UNCITRAL）和國際統一私法協會（UNIDROIT）的合作。透過這些工作，我們希望能進一步提升香港作為國際法律服務中心的地位。",
            "結語",
            "主席，以上是律政司在新的財政年度的主要工作。我和各同事會樂意解答各位委員的問題和聽取大家的意見。",
            "多謝各位。",
