            "The Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, started his visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to foster stronger ties between the two places today (November 7) and led a delegation comprising some 30 legal and dispute resolution professionals to promote Hong Kong’s international legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "Mr Yuen began the visit by addressing the opening ceremony of \"In Style．Hong Kong\" symposium organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and attended by over 1000 participants.",
            "\"Building on the flourishing relation between Malaysia and Hong Kong, the Hong Kong-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and related Investment Agreement will be signed very soon,\" Mr Yuen said at the opening ceremony.",
            "\"Not only will the FTA provide an appropriate platform to further enhance the flow of trade and investment between Hong Kong and ASEAN, it will further strengthen Hong Kong’s role as the \"facilitator\" facilitating Mainland businesses to go global and overseas enterprises to enter the mega Mainland market.",
            "\"Together with the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), which is our free-trade arrangement with Mainland China, the FTA will provide better access for ASEAN companies, including Malaysian companies, to the Mainland market, as well as to the opportunities made possible by the Belt and Road Initiative,” he said.",
            "In the afternoon, Mr Yuen gave opening remarks at the thematic session on \"Legal Risk Management: Key to International Trade and Investment\", which is part of the \"In Style．Hong Kong\" symposium and co-organised by the Department of Justice and HKTDC.",
            "The Secretary said Hong Kong is not just the ideal bridge between Mainland China and Malaysia, but is also well placed to provide a wide range of professional services to facilitate Malaysian businesses in grasping emerging opportunities as projects contemplated under the Belt and Road Initiative unfold.",
            "Highlighting the importance of legal risk management in modern business practice, Mr Yuen said that with a robust legal regime, Hong Kong is ready and able to serve as an international and yet neutral legal risk management and dispute resolution hub.",
            "Mr Yuen also launched \"Hong Kong Live in Kuala Lumpur\" presented by the Hong Kong Tourism Board to promote Hong Kong tourism experiences.",
            "\"Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur are cities with a great deal in common. Both are multi-cultural cities famous for their dynamic city life and spectacular attractions. Both are must-visit destinations for the discerning world travellers,” he said at the launch ceremony.",
            "Mr Yuen took the opportunity to pay a courtesy call on the Charge d’Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia, Madam Ma Jia.",
            "He ended the day by officiating at the \"In Style．Hong Kong\" Gala Dinner, during which Mr Yuen highlighted the importance of Hong Kong SAR Government attached to the created industry.",
            "Mr Yuen and representatives of Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution delegation will meet with the relevant Malaysian officials to exchange views on matters of mutual interest and visit the arbitration centre in Kuala Lumpur tomorrow (November 8) before concluding the visit and returning to Hong Kong in the evening.",
