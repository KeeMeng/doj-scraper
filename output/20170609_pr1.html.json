            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) announced today (June 9) the outcome of the supplementary application exercise for allocating certain space in the West Wing of the former Central Government Offices (CGO) and the former French Mission Building (FMB) in Central to law-related organisations (LROs) for the provision of legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "A spokesman for the DoJ said that pursuant to the policy objective of consolidating Hong Kong's status as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, the Government will provide certain space to LROs in the West Wing of the former CGO and the former FMB. Together with the DoJ offices in the Main Wing, the East Wing and part of West Wing of the former CGO, the whole area is intended to form a legal hub at the heart of Hong Kong.",
            "The spokesman said, \"Following the conclusion of the Stage 1 application exercise, a supplementary application exercise had been held under which a total of 10 applications were considered. After assessing the applications based on the relative merits of the respective organisations, the Committee on Provision of Space in the Legal Hub (the Committee) recommended that the application of five LROs (list attached at Annex) should be supported.\"",
            "Under the two exercises, a total of 17 LROs (including 12 LROs recommended under the Stage 1 application exercise) have been recommended by the Committee. These LROs, all of which have confirmed acceptance of the offer of space in the legal hub, cover a good mix of reputable local, regional and international organisations specialising in different legal or dispute resolution services or functions, thereby reflecting Hong Kong's status as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region. The DoJ will liaise with these LROs on the detailed arrangements for the allocation of space, with a view to making available to them the space concerned in the legal hub starting from around early 2019 at the earliest.",
            "Looking ahead, the Committee plans to launch a Stage 2 application exercise in or around 2018.",
            "The provision of space to LROs in the legal hub will enable existing ones to further develop their services and create a favourable environment to attract reputable international legal and dispute resolution institutions to set up offices in Hong Kong, which will further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region.",

            "就法律相關組織申請使用中環前中區政府合署西座及前法國外方傳道會大樓（傳道會大樓）的空間，以提供法律及爭議解決服務，律政司今日（六月九日）公布補充申請階段的結果。",
            "律政司發言人表示，為配合鞏固香港作為亞太區內主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心地位的政策目標，政府將在前中區政府合署西座的部分地方及在傳道會大樓，提供空間給法律相關組織使用。連同律政司位於前中區政府合署中座、東座和部分西座的辦公室，該處將成為位於香港市中心的法律樞紐。",
            "發言人表示：「在第一階段申請完成後隨即進行的補充階段申請中，共考慮了十份申請。法律樞紐空間分配委員會（委員會）就各法律相關組織的相對優次評審所有申請後，建議支持五個法律相關組織（名單見附件）的申請。」",
            "在兩輪申請中，共有十七個法律相關組織（包括在第一階段獲推薦的十二個組織）獲委員會推薦。這些組織均已確認接受當局在法律樞紐為其提供空間。它們涵蓋本地、地區性及國際性的不同著名組織，專注不同的法律或爭議解決服務或職能，反映香港作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務主要中心的地位。律政司將與這些組織聯絡，商討空間分配的詳細安排，以期最早約於二○一九年初起在法律樞紐為它們提供空間。",
            "往後，委員會計劃約在二○一八年展開第二階段的申請工作。",
            "在法律樞紐提供空間予法律相關組織使用，有助現已在港的組織進一步發展服務，並締造良好環境吸引著名國際法律及爭議解決機構來港設立辦事處，從而進一步提升香港作為主要亞太區國際法律和爭議解決服務中心的競爭力。",
