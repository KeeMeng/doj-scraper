            "In response to comments from some overseas politicians concerning a man who was charged under the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) today (December 12) reiterated that all prosecutions are carried out in strict accordance with the law.",
            "Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that prosecutions in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) are made by the DoJ, free from any interference. No one should interfere or attempt to interfere with independent prosecutorial decisions which are based on an objective assessment of all admissible evidence and applicable laws.",
            "\"As the case is under legal proceedings, it is inappropriate for any of us to comment further. We are appalled by such open demands for withdrawal of charge and immediate release of the defendant by senior officials in another jurisdiction. Such acts not only disrespect the HKSAR's judicial system and undermine the spirit of the rule of law, but also attempt to meddle in Hong Kong's affairs which are internal affairs of the People's Republic of China,\" the DoJ spokesman said.",
            "The Secretary for Justice has emphasised on many occasions that the Prosecution Code of the DoJ provides clear, consistent guidelines and principles for carrying out prosecution work. A prosecutor must not be influenced by any investigatory, political, media, community or individual interest or representation. All prosecutorial decisions are based on admissible evidence, applicable laws and the Prosecution Code, without political consideration. Cases will not be handled any differently owing to the political beliefs or background of the persons involved. Prosecutions would only be commenced if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction.",
            "Any demands or statements that purport to interfere with the prosecutorial decision and process controlled by the DoJ or the independent exercise of judicial power by the judiciary of the HKSAR will be futile. These constitutional functions and duties are laid down in the Basic Law and the independent exercise of them is guaranteed. Every law-abiding person should respect and uphold such guarantees and the HKSAR Government will ensure that these powers and duties are properly and duly exercised free from any interference. The judicial process will be continued in accordance with the law, fairly and independently.",

            "對於有一些海外政客就一名男子被控以涉及《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》的罪名所發表的言論，律政司發言人今日（十二月十二日）重申，所有檢控工作均是嚴格按照法律進行。",
            "《基本法》第六十三條指出檢控工作由香港特別行政區（香港特區）律政司主管，不受任何干涉。任何人都不應干涉或企圖干涉獨立的檢控決定，檢控決定是基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析後而作出。",
            "律政司發言人說：「由於相關案件的司法程序尚在進行中，任何人都不適宜對案件作進一步評論。對於有另一司法管轄區的高層官員公開要求撤銷控罪及立即釋放被告，我們感到驚訝，這些行徑除了不尊重香港特區的司法制度、損害法治精神之餘，更企圖去干預屬於中華人民共和國內政的香港事務。」",
            "律政司司長曾經在不同場合強調，《檢控守則》為檢控工作提供清晰並貫徹的指引和原則。檢控人員不得受任何涉及調查、政治、傳媒、社群或個人的利益或陳述的因素影響。所有檢控決定是按可接納證據、適用法律和《檢控守則》而作出，不會有任何政治考慮。案件不會因涉案人士的政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同，律政司在有充分可被法院接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪的情況下，才會提出起訴。",
            "若任何要求或聲明有意干涉由香港特區律政司主管的檢控決定和程序，或影響香港特區司法機構獨立進行審判，必定徒勞無功。這些憲制職能和責任已在《基本法》內訂明，保障得以獨立行使。奉公守法的人都應該對此尊重並加以維護，香港特區政府亦會確保該等職能和責任得以妥善履行和秉公處理，不受任何干涉。司法程序將會依法獨立並公正地繼續進行。",
