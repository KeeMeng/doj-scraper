            "Following is the transcript of remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, at a media session after the meeting of the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services at the Legislative Council today (January 28):",
            "Reporter: Secretary, just regarding the Heritage Foundation's report, are you dismissing some of the concerns expressed in the report that there is increased interference from the Mainland? The second question is on your popularity. Do you think it is due to the fact that the Department of Justice didn't prosecute C Y Leung and that is harming your popularity? How would you deal with that?",
            "Secretary for Justice: First of all, on your second question, I can't really comment on how people comment. That's very important because they may have certain facts or they may not have certain facts. In fact, I won't want to comment on that. But insofar as the popularity survey is concerned, of course, I paid due regard to it and I am very aware of the concerns that the public have expressed through the survey. But I want to assure the public that I would continue to discharge my duty as the Secretary for Justice together with my colleagues at the Department of Justice with resolve, humility and professionalism. As to the first point about the Heritage Foundation, it is very important to bear in mind that judicial independence is well engraved and well embedded in Hong Kong's legal system. We are ranked number one in Asia for a number of years, in the World Economic Forum's the Global Competitiveness Report. The arrangements for the NPCSC (Standing Committee of the National People's Congress) to provide certain interpretation on the Basic Law have been in place since 1997 and have been working well for Hong Kong in the light of the World Bank Indicators showing that our ranking on the rule of law has moved from 69.9% in 1996 all the way up to 93.8% in 2017. We moved from top 70th to top 14th on our rule of law. So, we are very confident that we will continue to uphold the rule of law and provide a very good system for both businesses as well as natural persons in Hong Kong.",
            "Reporters: Secretary, could you enlighten us whether you are personally involved when giving your personal opinion, without encroaching on the merit of the case? Whether you are personally involved in the C Y Leung's case? And on the Heritage Foundation's report, do we have your words that you will not seek NPCSC's interpretation during your term of office?",
            "Secretary for Justice: Insofar as the working within the Department of Justice is concerned, irrespective of whichever case, we are not going to divulge. It is a matter of professional basic ethics that everybody expected that the discussions especially involving legal matters are to be contained within the Department of Justice and kept confidential. Therefore, I would not, unfortunately, be able to respond to your first question. As to the question that you asked based on the Heritage Foundation's comment, may I perhaps deal with it in this way - you asked whether I can guarantee or promise - well I am sure you would appreciate that under the Basic Law which is a national law, the ultimate power to interpret the Basic Law rests with the NPCSC under Article 158. Now whether and how they are going to exercise that power is not something that I can embark upon or to comment upon. And if the case so requires, that may happen. But having said that, one must not forget that under the arrangement of the Basic Law, insofar as any provisions that are set out in the Basic Law is concerned that relates to Hong Kong autonomous arrangements, that is our own matters. The court in Hong Kong will and can make their own interpretation of the provisions in the Basic Law, and therefore, will be able to do that without the need to seeking any interpretation from the NPCSC. And most importantly, it is not just a matter of law. Any decision on any case requires the consideration or an application of the facts to the law in order for the decision to come about. It is the court of Hong Kong, the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, in particular, that is going to make that decision at the end of the day. Thank you very much.",

            "以下是律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（一月二十八日）出席立法會司法及法律事務委員會會議後，與傳媒談話的內容：",
            "律政司司長：多謝各位朋友。我想就Heritage Foundation（傳統基金會）最近發表的意見作出一些回應。香港的司法獨立其實在《基本法》中有一個保障，不單是法制上的保障，其實結構上亦保障了司法獨立。在一九九七年回歸後，大家也知道，我們不需要到樞密院尋求最終的審判，我們的終審權返回香港，所以Court of Final Appeal（終審法院）就是我們的終審權，這一點非常重要，在一九九七年時已經如是。從《基本法》中，我們知道香港的法院可以就香港自治範圍內涉及《基本法》的條款，獲得授權解釋，所以香港的法院可以有解釋權，這是香港《基本法》第一百五十八條第二款（訂明）。在一些情況下，人大（全國人民代表大會）可以釋法，根據《基本法》第一百五十八條，我們經常提到的第一款，可以有最終的釋法權，但釋法只是解釋法律，最終就案件的決定，要將事實－即是在終審庭上的事實理據－結合法律，才可作出決定。所以由始至終，這個安排自一九九七年，已經在香港運作良好。",
            "而香港的司法獨立，如果大家看World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report，即（世界經濟論壇）《全球競爭力報告》，可以看到在過去幾年，香港的司法獨立在亞洲一直排行第一。如果再看另外一個報告World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators（世界銀行《世界管治指標》），在該報告中的這一點更加明顯，指我們的法治一直向上。在一九九六年即回歸前，我們的法治分數或Rating（排名）是百分之69.9，到二○一七年，我們的Rating（排名）是百分之93.8。換句話說，我們回歸後，法治的Rating（排名）穩步向上，我們由二○○三年開始，分數已經超過百分之90。由一九九六年，排名首七十位，至二○一七年最近期的報告中，我們已經跳至首十四位，所以這一點對我們法治的發展有清楚的指標和信心。多謝各位。",
            "記者：司長，最新發出的民調顯示三名司長的評分比之前低，而你則最低，你對市民透過民調所表達的聲音，有何看法？",
            "律政司司長：我聽到亦注意到，並會關注市民對我的期望。我會不斷努力，以及謙卑、專業地做我的工作。",
            "記者：前刑事檢控專員江樂士表示，如果你公開理據是還涉案人一個公道，其實，你說公開會做成公審，你是指對梁振英的公審，還是對律政司的公審？",
            "律政司司長：多謝你的提問，我不想就任何人的意見作出評論。不過我就你剛才提到的一點，我這樣跟大家說，香港社會注重無罪的推定，所以我們每一個人，未經過法庭作出一個判決時，大家也是無罪的。假若我們認為有一些人需要還他一個清白，其實是否有一個錯誤的假設－－他是被社會認為有罪，所以我們要還他一個清白？如果是這一點的話，我希望社會緊記法治很重要的原則，就是Presumption of innocence（無罪假設），我們不可以有這樣的思維。",
            "記者：司長，可否回應有關申訴專員公署指律政司違反服務承諾，十四日內未有回覆東方日報就刑恐記者一事的提問，可以回應為何會違反服務承諾，以及對於不檢控黎智英的決定，可否講解一下？",
            "律政司司長：我不會就任何個別案件作出任何回應，不過我們注意到Ombudsman（申訴專員公署）的意見，我們會回去跟進。",
