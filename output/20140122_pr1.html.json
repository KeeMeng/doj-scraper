            "Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council today (January 22):",
            "Question:",
            "It is learnt that in addition to the statutory compensation scheme under Article 11(5) in Part II (Hong Kong Bill of Rights) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383), there is a practice of the Government awarding ex gratia payments on moral or compassionate grounds in certain exceptional cases of miscarriage of justice in which the Government is not legally liable. Such cases include but are not limited to those in which the claimant has spent time in custody following a wrongful conviction or charge resulting from serious default by the police or other public authority, notwithstanding the fact that the circumstances offer no grounds for any claim of civil damages. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) of the respective numbers of applications for ex gratia payments approved and rejected in the past five years; the particulars of those approved cases, including the amount of payments awarded in each case as well as the reasons for some applications being rejected, if any;",
            "(2) by which agency and with what criteria applications for ex gratia payments are assessed;",
            "(3) of the number and particulars of the complaints received by the Government in the past five years about rejection of applications for ex gratia payments or about the amounts of payments awarded; and",
            "(4) whether it has assessed if a conflict of interests may arise on the part of the Secretary for Justice and relevant government departments in the assessment of applications for ex gratia payments; if the assessment outcome is in the affirmative, whether the Government will make reference to the system in the United Kingdom and replace the current arrangement for processing such applications with a statutory scheme under which an independent assessor is appointed to consider the merits of the applications for ex gratia payments and determine the amounts of payments to be awarded; if it will, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "(1) The total number of applications for ex gratia payments under the administrative arrangement in the past five years is nine. Out of these nine cases, seven applications were rejected, one application was considered by the Solicitor General to fall within the guidelines (pending determination of quantum) and one application is pending determination. The case pending determination of quantum of ex gratia payment remains the subject of without prejudice correspondence between the Department of Justice and the applicant's legal advisers. The reason for the rejection of those seven rejected applications is that those cases failed to satisfy the relevant criteria set out in Part (2) below.",
            "(2) The Solicitor General with the assistance of counsel within the Legal Policy Division of the Department of Justice is responsible for considering whether a particular case falls within the guidelines. The amount payable is determined by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, taking into account the views of the Department of Justice and any other affected department or bureau. The administrative guidelines for the payment of ex gratia compensation are as follows:",
            "(a) Compensation may be payable to a person convicted of a criminal offence who has spent time in custody and has received a free pardon because his innocence has been established or his conviction has been quashed following a reference to the Court of Appeal by the Chief Executive or an appeal out of time.",
            "(b) Compensation may be payable where a person has spent time in custody following a wrongful conviction or charge resulting from serious default by the police or other public authority. For example, refusal of bail because of incorrect information given to the court by the prosecutor or the police, or police suppression of material evidence which would have helped to exonerate a convicted person. Compensation may also be payable on this basis where the wrongful act was that of a judge or magistrate but, to preserve the perceived independence of the judiciary, payment in such cases should only be made on the recommendation of the judiciary itself.",
            "(c) Aside from guidelines (a) and (b), compensation may be payable in outstandingly deserving cases even where the loss was not caused by a wrongful act or omission by a public authority.",
            "(d) Compensation would not be paid simply because the prosecution was unable to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt in relation to a particular charge.",
            "(e) Compensation may be refused where there is serious doubt about the claimant's innocence, based on the argument that it would be repugnant to pay compensation out of public funds to a person who is probably guilty but, for example, whose conviction was quashed on a mere technicality.",
            "(f) Compensation may be refused or reduced proportionately where the claimant is wholly or partly to blame for his misfortune; for example, he deliberately withheld evidence which would have demonstrated his innocence.",
            "(g) From the perspective of public policy or administration, extending compensation beyond guidelines (a), (b) and (c) to persons who have suffered loss in the ordinary course of the criminal process (for example, to those to whom guideline (d) applies) would have substantial cost and other resource implications. There would be a much larger number of potential claimants and a tribunal or some other special machinery would be required to investigate each case and distinguish the claimants who are very probably innocent from those who were lucky to escape conviction.",
            "If the case falls within the guidelines, compensation would include:",
            "(a) Pecuniary losses",
            "(i) Loss of earnings (including, where relevant, loss of future earnings);",
            "(ii) Losses and expenses reasonably incurred by the claimant's family;",
            "(iii) Any other ascertainable losses, e.g. through forced sale of business assets rendered unusable by the claimant's conviction or punishment and investment income on money paid in fines;",
            "(iv) In so far as they have been borne by the claimant or his family and have not already been reimbursed, such legal expenses as he reasonably incurred in the original proceedings in which he was convicted.",
            "(b) Non-pecuniary losses",
            "(i) Loss of liberty;",
            "(ii) Damage to character and reputation.",
            "The claimant may also be reimbursed the expenses, legal or otherwise, reasonably incurred by him in pursuing his claim for compensation. Interim payments of compensation may be made in suitable cases of amounts which total less than the minimum likely final award.",
            "(3) The Department of Justice does not keep statistics of the number and particulars of the complaints received by the Government in the past five years about rejection of applications for ex gratia payments or about the amounts of payments awarded.",
            "(4) As noted in Part (2) above, applications for ex gratia payments under the administrative arrangement is handled by the Solicitor General with the assistance of counsel within the Legal Policy Division of the Department of Justice. Where necessary, outside independent counsel's advice will also be sought. The Secretary for Justice is not involved in the consideration or determination process. In any event, in each application for ex gratia payment, the Department of Justice will assess whether a conflict of interests may arise on the part of the Secretary for Justice and relevant government departments. If the assessment outcome is in the affirmative, measures would be taken to avoid the potential conflicts such as briefing outside counsel to advise on the merits of the application.",
            "As regards the UK scheme of compensation, we note that the UK's ex gratia discretionary scheme was abolished in 2006 and its current compensation scheme is confined to claims in accordance with Article 14(6) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Moreover, the role of the independent assessor under UK's current scheme is limited to the assessment of quantum (but not eligibility for compensation). As such, the Department of Justice will continue to follow the practice set out in the first paragraph of this part of the reply in processing applications for ex gratia payments.",

            "以下是今日（一月二十二日）在立法會會議上郭榮鏗議員的提問和律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "據悉，除了《香港人權法案條例》（第383章）第II部（香港人權法案）第十一條第五款所訂的法定補償計劃，政府一向基於道德或體恤理由，在審判不公但政府無須因此負上法律責任的若干特殊情況下發放特惠補償金，當中包括但不限於申索人因警方或其他政府機構的嚴重失職而被錯誤定罪或起訴和隨後被拘押一段時間的個案，儘管此等情況不可作為提出民事索償的理由。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）過去五年，特惠補償金申請獲批及被拒的宗數分別為何；獲批個案的詳情，包括每宗個案獲發的補償金額，以及部分申請被拒（如有的話）的原因；",
            "（二）哪個機構負責評核特惠補償金申請，以及有關的評核準則為何；",
            "（三）過去五年，政府接獲有關特惠補償金申請被拒或不滿獲發的補償金額的投訴宗數及詳情；及",
            "（四）有否評估律政司司長及相關政府部門在評核特惠補償金申請時會否出現利益衝突；若評估結果為會，政府會否參照英國的制度，以法定計劃取代現行處理此類申請的安排，而在該計劃下委任獨立評核員負責考慮特惠補償金申請的理據及決定擬發放的補償金額；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "（一）過去五年，根據行政安排提出的特惠補償金申請共有九宗。在這九宗申請中，申請被拒的個案有七宗、法律政策專員認為屬指引涵蓋範圍的個案有一宗（補償金額有待釐定），而有待決定的個案有一宗。關於該宗特惠補償金金額有待釐定的個案，律政司與申請人的法律顧問仍在進行「內容不損害權益」的通訊。至於七宗被拒的申請不獲批准，是由於未能符合下文第（二）部分回覆所述的相關準則。",
            "（二）在律政司法律政策科的律師輔助下，法律政策專員負責考慮個別個案是否屬指引涵蓋的範圍。財經事務及庫務局局長經考慮律政司和任何其他受影響的決策局或部門的意見後，會釐定應發放的金額。有關發放特惠補償金的行政指引如下︰",
            "（1）若某人就某項刑事罪行被定罪而被拘押一段時間，且其後因被證實無辜而獲無條件赦免，或在行政長官把案件轉交上訴法庭後或經逾時提出的上訴而獲撤銷定罪，則可發放補償金予該人。",
            "（2）若某人因警方或其他公共機構的嚴重錯失而被錯誤定罪或起訴和隨後被羈押一段時間，則該人可獲發放補償金。例如，被告人因檢控人員或警方給予法庭不正確資料而遭拒絕保釋，又或警方隱瞞本有助寬免被定罪者罪責的關鍵性證供。如錯誤作為是由法官或裁判官作出，申索人也可據此獲發放補償金，但為保持司法機構獨立的觀感，就該等案件支付的補償只可按司法機構的建議而作出。",
            "（3）除指引的（1）及（2）項外，在特別值得補償的案件中，即使有關損失並非由公共機構的錯誤作為或不作為所引致，申索人也可獲發放補償金。",
            "（4）若純粹因為控方未能就某項控罪證實案中無合理疑點，則申索人不會獲發放補償金。",
            "（5）如對申索人是否無辜有嚴重質疑，可拒絕發放補償金，所依論據是，若用公帑向可能有罪但基於例如純粹技術問題而獲撤銷定罪的人作出補償，會令人反感。",
            "（6）如申索人須對本身的不幸情況承擔全部或部分責任，例如他蓄意隱瞞本可證明其無辜的證據，則可拒絕發放補償或按比例削減補償金額。",
            "（7）從公共政策或公共行政的角度來看，若把補償範圍由指引（1）、（2）和（3）項所述情況延伸至在一般刑事程序中蒙受損失的人（例如指引（4）項適用的人），會帶來費用和其他資源的龐大影響。準申索人的數目會大增，以致需交由一個審裁機構或其他特別機制調查每宗案件，以便把極可能是無辜的申索人從那些僥倖免被定罪的申索人區分開來。",
            "如個案屬指引涵蓋的範圍，補償金會計及：",
            "（a）金錢損失",
            "（i）入息損失（在有關的情況下包括未來入息）；",
            "（ii）申索人的家人合理招致的損失和開支；",
            "（iii）任何其他可確定的損失，例如經被迫出售因申索人被定罪或受懲處而不能使用的業務資產所招致的損失，以及支付罰款的金錢如用作投資可帶來的收入的損失；",
            "（iv）及至申索人在被定罪的原訟法律程序中所合理招致並由申索人或其家人承擔，而又尚未獲付還的法律開支。",
            "（b）非金錢損失",
            "（i）失去自由；",
            "（ii）對品格或聲譽造成的損害。",
            "申索人在申索補償的過程中合理招致的法律開支或其他開支，也可獲付還。在合適情況下，申索人可獲發中期補償金，但總金額會少於最低的可能最終補償金。",
            "（三）關於過去五年政府就特惠補償金申請被拒或判給的金額所接獲的投訴，律政司沒有備存有關的統計數字及投訴詳情。",
            "（四）正如上文第（二）部分回覆所述，法律政策專員在律政司法律政策科的律師輔助下，負責處理根據行政安排提出的特惠補償金申請。如有需要，亦會尋求獨立的私人執業大律師的意見。律政司司長不會參與考慮或決定過程。無論如何，律政司在處理每宗特惠補償金申請時，都會評估律政司司長或相關政府部門會否有利益衝突。假如評估結果為會，我們會採取措施避免潛在的利益衝突，例如委聘私人執業大律師就申請的成功機會提供意見。",
            "至於英國的補償計劃，我們知悉英國已在二○○六年廢除酌情發放特惠補償的計劃，現行補償計劃的範圍只限於根據《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十四條第六項提出的申索。此外，英國現行計劃的獨立評核員所擔當的角色，只限於評核補償金額（而非申領補償的資格）。因此，律政司在處理特惠補償金的申請時，會繼續依循本部分答覆第一段所述的做法。",

            "（5）如對申索人是否無辜有嚴重質疑，可拒絕發放補償金，所依論據是，若用公帑向可能有罪但基於例如純粹技術問題而獲撤銷定罪的人作出補償，會令人反感",
            "（6）如申索人須對本身的不幸情況承擔全部或部分責任，例如他蓄意隱瞞本可證明其無辜的證據，則可拒絕發放補償或按比例削減補償金額",
            "（7）從公共政策或公共行政的角度來看，若把補償範圍由指引（1）、（2）和（3）項所述情況延伸至在一般刑事程序中蒙受損失的人（例如指引（4）項適用的人），會帶來費用和其他資源的龐大影響",
            "準申索人的數目會大增，以致需交由一個審裁機構或其他特別機制調查每宗案件，以便把極可能是無辜的申索人從那些僥倖免被定罪的申索人區分開來",
            "如個案屬指引涵蓋的範圍，補償金會計及：",
            "（a）金錢損失",
            "（i）入息損失（在有關的情況下包括未來入息）；",
            "（ii）申索人的家人合理招致的損失和開支；",
            "（iii）任何其他可確定的損失，例如經被迫出售因申索人被定罪或受懲處而不能使用的業務資產所招致的損失，以及支付罰款的金錢如用作投資可帶來的收入的損失；",
            "（iv）及至申索人在被定罪的原訟法律程序中所合理招致並由申索人或其家人承擔，而又尚未獲付還的法律開支",
            "（b）非金錢損失",
            "（i）失去自由；",
            "（ii）對品格或聲譽造成的損害",
            "申索人在申索補償的過程中合理招致的法律開支或其他開支，也可獲付還",
            "在合適情況下，申索人可獲發中期補償金，但總金額會少於最低的可能最終補償金",
            "（三）關於過去五年政府就特惠補償金申請被拒或判給的金額所接獲的投訴，律政司沒有備存有關的統計數字及投訴詳情",
            "（四）正如上文第（二）部分回覆所述，法律政策專員在律政司法律政策科的律師輔助下，負責處理根據行政安排提出的特惠補償金申請",
            "如有需要，亦會尋求獨立的私人執業大律師的意見",
            "律政司司長不會參與考慮或決定過程",
            "無論如何，律政司在處理每宗特惠補償金申請時，都會評估律政司司長或相關政府部門會否有利益衝突",
            "假如評估結果為會，我們會採取措施避免潛在的利益衝突，例如委聘私人執業大律師就申請的成功機會提供意見",
            "至於英國的補償計劃，我們知悉英國已在二○○六年廢除酌情發放特惠補償的計劃，現行補償計劃的範圍只限於根據《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十四條第六項提出的申索",
            "此外，英國現行計劃的獨立評核員所擔當的角色，只限於評核補償金額（而非申領補償的資格）",
            "因此，律政司在處理特惠補償金的申請時，會繼續依循本部分答覆第一段所述的做法",
