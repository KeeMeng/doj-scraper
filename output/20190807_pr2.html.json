            "In response to the procession by certain members of the legal profession today (August 7), a spokesman for the Department of Justice (DoJ) issued the following statement:",
            "Prosecutors of the DoJ always uphold the constitutional duty under Article 63 of the Basic Law in handling all prosecution works in a fair and impartial manner. Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that \"the DoJ of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference\".",
            "In making decisions of whether or not to prosecute in each case, the DoJ must make an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and applicable law, and act in accordance with the Prosecution Code. The DoJ will not handle the cases differently due to the political beliefs or background of the persons involved. Any person suspected of breaking the law, including when acts of violence or vandalism are involved, the decision on prosecution and related charges will be made in accordance with the above principles and there is no political consideration.",
            "All investigations are conducted by law enforcement agencies which will, after completion of investigation and when necessary, refer the cases to the DoJ for making independent prosecutional decisions. The time required for making prosecutional decisions depends on a number of factors, including the time required for law enforcement agencies to conduct the investigation, the amount of evidence and the nature and complexity of the cases.",
            "The Secretary for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the prosecution team have all along been discharging their prosecutorial duties fairly and without prejudice or favour so as to safeguard criminal justice.",
            "In addition, the Secretary for Justice and DoJ colleagues have all along maintained communication with different parties in the legal and dispute resolution sectors. A number of meetings with representatives of these sectors to exchange views and suggestions on the present situation and the Policy Address have been held recently. The DoJ will continue to liaise with other members of these sectors to meet and is willing to listen to the views of the legal and dispute resolution sectors on appropriate occasions.",

            "就部分法律界人士今日（八月七日）遊行，律政司發言人發出以下聲明：",
            "律政司的檢控人員一直恪守《基本法》第六十三條下的憲制責任，以公平公正的方式處理所有檢控工作。《基本法》第六十三條訂明：「香港特別行政區律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」。",
            "律政司就每宗案件作出檢控與否的決定時，必須就所得證據和適用法律進行客觀和專業的分析，並按《檢控守則》行事，不會因涉案人士的政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。任何人士涉嫌違法，包括涉及暴力或破壞行為，檢控與否的決定及有關控罪都會按照上述原則而作出，並沒有任何政治考慮。",
            "所有案件的調查工作由執法機關負責。調查完畢後，執法機關有需要時才會交予律政司獨立決定是否提出檢控。就檢控所需要的處理時間，這要視乎多項因素而定，例如執法機關進行調查所需的時間、證據的數量、案件性質及複雜程度等。",
            "律政司司長、刑事檢控專員及刑事檢控科團隊在進行檢控工作時，一直不偏不倚、一視同仁，以維持司法公義。",
            "另外，律政司司長和同事一直與法律界和爭議解決界不同人士保持溝通，最近亦曾與該等界別代表分別舉行多場會面，就社會現時情況及《施政報告》交流意見和建議。律政司會繼續聯絡界別的其他人士進行會面，並樂意在適合場合聆聽法律界和爭議解決界的意見。",
