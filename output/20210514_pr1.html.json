            "The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, and Vice-president of the Supreme People's Court (SPC) Mr Yang Wanming signed the record of meeting concerning mutual recognition of and assistance to insolvency proceedings between the courts of the Mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in Shenzhen this morning (May 14). The arrangement highlights the unique role enjoyed by the HKSAR under \"one country, two systems\", fostering further legal co-operation in civil and commercial matters.",
            "Ms Cheng said that the record of meeting signified the consensus on the mutual recognition of and assistance to insolvency proceedings between the two places. Liquidators from Hong Kong may apply to Mainland courts for recognition of insolvency proceedings in Hong Kong. Likewise, bankruptcy administrators from the Mainland may apply to the High Court in Hong Kong for recognition of bankruptcy proceedings in the Mainland. The framework facilitates the rescue of financially troubled businesses, and provides better protection of the assets of the debtor company as well as the interests of the creditors, and is hence conducive to the promotion of an orderly and efficient insolvency regime. The new co-operative framework expressly covers bankruptcy compromise and reorganisation in the Mainland as well as debt restructuring in Hong Kong, thereby encouraging the use of restructuring of debts to revive businesses with a view to reaching consensus among creditors from both places and abroad. This may open up more opportunities for the debtor company to look for a successful rescue. In the long run, the framework will give additional assurance to investors and further improve the business environment in the Mainland and Hong Kong.",
            "The key features of the record of meeting include: the SPC will designate a number of pilot areas where the relevant Intermediate People's Courts and HKSAR courts will commence the work on mutual recognition of and assistance in insolvency proceedings in accordance with the laws. A set of opinion and a practical guide will be issued respectively by the SPC and the HKSAR Government in respect of their relevant work on the matter. Both sides will continue to maintain close communication for sustained improvement to the mechanism, and to gradually extend beyond the pilot areas. The SPC has initially designated Shanghai, Xiamen and Shenzhen as pilot cities given their close trade ties with Hong Kong. The three cities are also the popular choices for investments from Hong Kong.",
            "The Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court will hold a forum on legal and practical issues concerning cross-boundary insolvency co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong in the afternoon. The Department of Justice is the supporting organisation. Speakers including judges, academics and legal professionals from the Mainland and Hong Kong will take part in discussions covering the scope and the specific procedures for legal assistance in cross-boundary insolvency, as well as the key mechanism on legal assistance in cross-boundary insolvency in the Greater Bay Area. This will give the audience a better understanding that the co-operative framework helps fully implement the Basic Law and consolidate the legal assistance between the two places.",

            "鄭若驊表示，簽署《會談紀要》標誌着香港與內地就認可及協助破產程序達成共識，香港的清盤人可向內地法院申請認可在香港的清盤程序，而內地的破產管理人亦可以向香港高等法院申請認可在內地的破產程序，這樣既可協助拯救經濟上有困難的企業，同時也加強保護債務人的資產及債權人的利益，將更有利推行有秩序及高效率的清盤制度。新的合作機制明確涵蓋內地的破產和解和重整程序，以及香港的債務重組程序，鼓勵透過重組挽救企業，利便兩地和國際債權人盡早就重組計劃達成共識，提高債務人獲重生避免破產的機會。長遠而言，這有助加強投資者的信心，完善兩地的營商環境。",
            "《會談紀要》的內容主要包括：最高人民法院將指定若干試點地區，有關中級人民法院與香港特區法院依法開展相互認可和協助破產程序的工作；最高人民法院和香港特區政府並會分別就兩地開展的相關工作，發布意見和實用指南，並保持溝通，持續完善有關機制，逐步擴大試點範圍。最高人民法院首階段指定上海、廈門和深圳作為試點，這些城市與香港經貿關係密切，並且是香港在內地投資的重點地方。",
            "深圳市中級人民法院將於下午舉辦有關內地與香港跨境破產合作的法律與實務的論壇，律政司是支持單位，論壇講者包括內地和香港的法官、學者和法律執業人士等，討論的議題涵蓋跨境破產司法協助的範圍及具體程序，以及大灣區跨境破產協助的重點制度等，讓出席者了解合作機制有助貫徹落實《基本法》，鞏固兩地的司法協作。",
