            "The Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, continued her visit in Beijing today (July 30) to call on various ministries and authorities and discuss the professional development of the Hong Kong legal sector, and further promote Hong Kong's legal, dispute resolution and deal-making services.",
            "Ms Cheng held a meeting with the President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Mr Jin Liqun, in the morning. Noting that the Department of Justice (DoJ) has signed an agreement with the AIIB last month for the secondment of a DoJ legal officer to its legal department, Ms Cheng said that the sustainable development of the Hong Kong legal community would be facilitated by participating in the work of international organisations. It is also conducive to the development of Hong Kong's position as a leading international legal and dispute resolution services centre. She pointed out in the meeting that the robust legal system, strong rule of law and reliable common law system enjoyed by Hong Kong contribute to the healthy development of its financial market. Ms Cheng also introduced Hong Kong Legal Week, a signature event held by the DoJ in November every year that draws together legal and dispute resolution experts and more from different places to share their insights and experience on various topics.",
            "She then attended the signing ceremony for the memorandum of co-operation under the tripartite communication platform jointly held by the Department of Treaty and Law of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), the Bureau of Policies, Laws and Regulations of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council and the DoJ. The platform serves as a communication channel between Mainland enterprises and the Hong Kong legal profession to connect Mainland enterprises with Hong Kong legal experts in various areas, and through regular exchanges of experience and knowledge optimises the business and investment environments of both places and facilitates the export of Hong Kong's legal services. The first seminar on the legal challenges and strategies under the Belt and Road Initiative was held in Beijing in November 2019. The second seminar is planned to be held later this year if situation permits. A standing committee of legal experts of the DoJ will offer their professional views and analysis to the participants.",
            "In the afternoon, Ms Cheng attended an annual exchange meeting with the Department of Treaty and Law of MOFCOM. She highlighted that the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Working Group III pre-intersessional meeting was concluded in November 2020 in Hong Kong, and the UNCITRAL Working Group III meeting is tentatively scheduled to be held in Hong Kong later this year. Significant international meetings like these give Hong Kong legal professionals a better understanding of prevailing international legal practices and broaden their international horizons. She also stated that the DoJ will continue to organise the Investment Law and Investor-State Mediator Training Course, aiming to develop Hong Kong into an international investment law and international investment dispute resolution skills training base, and to build up a team of investment mediators in Asia to handle international investment disputes.",
            "Ms Cheng will return to Hong Kong via Shenzhen tomorrow (July 31).",

            "律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師今日（七月三十日）繼續北京的訪問行程，拜訪不同的部委和機構，商討香港法律界的專業發展和進一步推廣香港的法律、爭議解決和促成交易服務。",
            "鄭若驊上午先到訪亞洲基礎設施投資銀行（亞投行），與行長金立群會面。她提到律政司上月已經與亞投行簽訂協議，借調律政司律政人員到亞投行的法律部門，並表示參與國際組織的工作是促使香港法律界可持續發展的關鍵因素，有助鞏固香港作為主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。鄭若驊在會上指出香港擁有堅穩的法律制度、良好法治及成熟可靠的普通法制，令香港的金融市場健康發展。她亦向對方介紹律政司每年在十一月舉辦的「香港法律周」，雲集不同地方的法律及爭議解決專才等，就不同議題提出他們的看法和分享經驗。",
            "隨後，鄭若驊出席商務部條約法律司、國務院國有資產監督管理委員會政策法規局和律政司舉行的三方交流合作安排簽署儀式。該三方平台旨在為內地企業及香港法律界提供溝通渠道，連繫內地企業與香港不同範疇的法律專家，透過定期交流分享經驗和知識，優化兩地的營商和投資環境，同時促進輸出香港的法律服務。首次「一帶一路」的法律挑戰與策略研討會已於二○一九年十一月在北京舉行，若情況許可，第二次研討會計劃在今年稍後舉行，律政司的常設法律專家小組也會和與會者分享他們專業的分析和見解。",
            "鄭若驊在下午與商務部條約法律司進行年度交流，席間指出聯合國國際貿易法委員會（貿法委）第三工作組間會預備研討會已於去年十一月在香港舉行，而第三工作組間會暫定今年稍後在香港舉行。這些重要的國際會議可提高香港法律界人士對當前國際法律工作的認識，豐富他們的國際視野。她亦於會上表示律政司會繼續籌辦投資法及國際投資爭端調解技巧培訓課程，目標是將香港發展成為國際投資法及國際投資爭端調解技巧培訓基地，為亞洲區建構處理國際投資爭端的調解員團隊。",
