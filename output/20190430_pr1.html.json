            "The following is issued on behalf of the Law Reform Commission:",
            "The Law Reform Commission (LRC) released a report on \"Voyeurism and Non-consensual upskirt-photography\" today (April 30) recommending the introduction of a new and specific offence of voyeurism to deal with an act of non-consensual observation or visual recording (for example, a photograph, videotape, or digital image) of another person for a sexual purpose; and a new and specific offence in respect of non-consensual upskirt-photography.",
            "The report follows a study on the overall review of substantive sexual offences by the LRC's Review of Sexual Offences Sub-committee (Sub-committee), chaired by Mr Peter Duncan, SC, which issued three consultation papers in September 2012, November 2016 and May 2018 respectively. Noting the strong sentiments received in the consultation exercises and the imminent need for the introduction of these new offences, it was decided that it would be to the benefit of our community to expeditiously publish the report ahead of the remaining work of the Sub-committee. The responses to the consultation papers have been taken into account in formulating the final recommendation as regards voyeurism and non-consensual upskirt-photography in the report.",
            "The report recommends that a specific offence of voyeurism should be introduced along the lines of section 67 of the English Sexual Offences Act 2003 to criminalise acts of non-consensual observation or visual recording of another person for a sexual purpose. Such an act is a serious violation of another person's sexual autonomy. The English approach is favoured as it covers all aspects of the conduct including observation, channelling and recording; the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification is an element of the offence; and the definition of \"a private act\" is provided for in the legislation.",
            "The report also recommends that a specific offence of non-consensual upskirt-photography should be introduced along the lines of the newly added section 67A of the English Sexual Offences Act 2003 while taking into account a few issues.",
            "Firstly, the act of non-consensual upskirt-photography should be outlawed irrespective of its purpose. A catch-all provision would also have the advantage of criminalising acts of non-consensual upskirt-photography which are committed by persons under the employment of a third party and may do so for the purpose of obtaining a monetary return rather than for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification or for humiliating, alarming or distressing the victim.",
            "Secondly, there should be an additional offence to criminalise an act of non-consensual upskirt-photography done for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification. Such an offence would then qualify as a sexual offence and be covered by the Sexual Conviction Record Check Scheme.",
            "Thirdly, the catch-all provision would be a statutory alternative offence if the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification cannot be proved at trial.",
            "Lastly, the new offence of non-consensual upskirt-photography should cover any place (i.e. irrespective of whether the act took place in public or private).",
            "Copies of the report are available on request from the Secretariat of the Law Reform Commission at 4/F, East Wing, Justice Place, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central, Hong Kong. The report can also be accessed on the Commission's website at",

            "法律改革委員會（法改會）今日（四月三十日）發表《窺淫及未經同意下拍攝裙底》報告書，建議新訂一項特定的窺淫罪，以針對在未經同意下為了性的目的而對另一人進行觀察或視像記錄（例如以照片、錄影帶或數碼影像形式）的行為；以及新訂一項特定的未經同意下拍攝裙底罪。",
            "這份報告書是繼法改會轄下性罪行檢討小組委員會（小組委員會）就實質的性罪行進行全面檢討研究後撰寫的。小組委員會由鄧樂勤資深大律師擔任主席，曾分別於二○一二年九月、二○一六年十一月及二○一八年五月發表三份諮詢文件。鑑於在諮詢期間收到廣泛支持意見，以及有迫切需要訂立這些新罪行，法改會決定特別迅速地在小組委員會完成餘下工作前先行發表這份報告書，認為這會對社會有所裨益。在訂定報告書中有關窺淫及未經同意下拍攝裙底的最終建議時，諮詢文件的回應意見已予考慮。",
            "報告書建議，應訂立一項特定的窺淫罪，內容參照英格蘭《2003年性罪行法令》第67條，將未經同意下為了性的目的而對另一人進行觀察或視像記錄的行為刑事化。這類行為嚴重侵犯另一人的性自主權。法改會贊成採用英格蘭模式，理由是：英格蘭模式涵蓋有關行為的所有方面，包括進行觀察、安排渠道及進行記錄；為了得到性滿足是罪行的一項元素；以及在法例中為「私人行為」下定義。",
            "報告書亦建議，應訂立一項特定的未經同意下拍攝裙底罪，內容參照英格蘭《2003年性罪行法令》新加入的第67A條，同時需顧及以下事項。",
            "第一，未經同意下拍攝裙底行為不論目的為何，皆應定為不合法。這項「全面性」的條文還有一個好處，就是可以將受僱於第三者的人所作出的未經同意下拍攝裙底行為刑事化。這些人干犯這項罪行，可能是為了得到金錢回報，而不是為了得到性滿足或為了使受害人感到受侮辱、驚恐或困擾。",
            "第二，也應訂立額外罪行，將那些為了得到性滿足而作出的未經同意下拍攝裙底行為刑事化。這項罪行可列為性罪行，並為性罪行定罪紀錄查核機制所涵蓋。",
            "第三，如在審訊中未能證明有關目的是為了得到性滿足，則可以這項「全面性」的條文作為法定交替罪行。",
            "最後，新訂的未經同意下拍攝裙底罪應涵蓋任何地方（即不論有關行為是在公眾或私人地方發生）。",
