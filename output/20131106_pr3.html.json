            "The Solicitors (General) Costs (Amendment) Rules 2013 (Rules) were made under section 74 of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance. The Rules were published in the Gazette on June 21, 2013 and tabled at the LegCo afterwards.",
            "According to section 74 (3)(a) of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance, the Rules should be made by the Costs Committee. However, the Rules as appeared in the Gazette were signed by members of the Council of the Law Society of Hong Kong instead of members of the Costs Committee. The House Committee formed a subcommittee to consider whether the Rules were properly made and the follow-up actions required. The Subcommittee held two meetings, and I would like to thank the Subcommittee Chairman, the Hon Dennis Kwok, and its other Members, for their valuable views.",
            "As stated in the Report of the Subcommittee, the Administration has proposed three options for the Subcommittee's consideration. The relevant details are set out in the Report, and I would better not repeat them here.",
            "One of the options, i.e. Option (1) in the Report, involves publication of a new set of rules to be made by the proper party, namely the Costs Committee, with a corrigendum in the Gazette to explain the error. The Administration had indicated its preference for option (1), and I noted that the majority of the Subcommittee Members agreed that option (1) should be adopted for the following reasons. Firstly, it is apparent on the face of the record that the Rules as published in the Gazette on June 21 were not made by the proper authority vested with the requisite powers under the Legal Practitioners Ordinance. Secondly, there is no pending or on-going court case to challenge the legal effect of the Rules as a piece of subsidiary legislation. Thirdly, the Rules have not yet come into operation. Fourthly, there are precedent cases on the adoption of option (1). Finally, option (1) is most straight-forward among the three options.",
            "I understand that the Costs Committee will convene a meeting shortly to follow up on this matter, and I believe that the Law Society will take appropriate steps to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in the future.",
            "Thank you, President.",

            "《2013年律師（一般）事務費（修訂）規則》，以下簡稱《規則》，是根據《法律執業者條例》第74條訂立，在二○一三年六月二十一日刊登憲報，隨後提交立法會會議席上省覽。",
            "根據《法律執業者條例》第74（3）（a）條，這規則應由事務費委員會訂立。不過，是次在憲報所載的《規則》，是由律師會理事會的成員簽訂，而非由事務費委員會的成員簽署。有見及此，立法會內務委員會成立小組委員會，研究《規則》是否有效訂立，以及所需採取的跟進行動。小組委員會舉行兩次會議，擔任主席的郭榮鏗議員及其他委員均提供了寶貴意見，我希望藉此機會向他們致謝。",
            "正如事務委員會提交的報告所述，當局曾提出三個不同方案，供小組委員會考慮，有關詳情已刊載於報告內，我在此不再重述。",
            "其中一個方案，即報告提及的方案（1），是刊登由正確一方（即事務費委員會）訂立的一套新規則，並在憲報刊登更正聲明，解釋有關錯誤。政府當局表示這方案較可取，也是小組委員會大多數委員同意應採用的方案，原因如下。首先，從記錄表面來看，六月二十一日刊登憲報的《規則》明顯並非由獲《法律執業者條例》賦予所需權力的正確權力機關所訂立。第二，現時並無待決或正在審理的法庭案件，質疑《規則》作為附屬法例的法律效力。第三，《規則》尚未開始實施。第四，過往有採用方案（1）類似的先例。最後，方案（1）是三個方案中最直接最簡單的方案。",
            "據知，事務費委員會即將召開會議，盡快跟進此事。我相信，律師會亦會採取適當措施，以免再次出現類似的問題。",
