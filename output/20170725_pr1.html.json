Following is the introductory remarks by Mr Yuen:",
            "Thanks for attending this press conference concerning co-location.",
            "Ever since the planning stage of the Hong Kong Section of the Express Rail Link, which I shall call, in short form, the XRL, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) has been studying co-location arrangement as the clearance procedures for the XRL. In his 2007-2008 Policy Address, the then Chief Executive announced that the feasibility of implementing co-location arrangement would be actively considered. When the HKSARG made the relevant funding application before the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council, it again indicated that the Government would study the implementation of co-location arrangement.",
            "The HKSARG takes the view that implementing co-location arrangement at the West Kowloon Station can maximise the benefits that may arise from the operation of the Hong Kong Section of XRL. On the contrary, if the traditional form of separate-location arrangement were to be implemented, the benefit of the Hong Kong Section of XRL would be greatly reduced, and would be inconsistent with the original intention of constructing the Hong Kong Section of the XRL.",
            "Throughout the period during which the HKSARG and the relevant Mainland authorities conducted study and discussion, both sides have all along agreed that co-location arrangement should comply with three objectives, namely:",
            "First, from the legal perspective, it should be consistent with the \"one country, two systems\" policy, and should not contravene the Basic Law.",
            "Second, from the operational perspective, it has to be feasible and effective.",
            "Third, from the security perspective, it should be able to manage security risk robustly, so as to prevent security loopholes.",
            "The purpose of today's meeting is to introduce the proposal concerning co-location. I will first invite the Secretary for Transport and Housing, Mr Frank Chan, to do his part of the introduction; thereafter, I and the Secretary for Security, Mr John Lee, will respectively do the introduction on the legal and security aspects. After a few concluding remarks by me, we would be more than happy to answer your questions.",

            "特區政府認為在西九龍站落實一地兩檢最能夠發揮高鐵（香港段）的經濟及運輸等效益。相反，若然落實傳統的「兩地兩檢」，高鐵（香港段）的效益會大大減低，不符合興建高鐵（香港段）的原意。",

            "（1）第一，在法律上必須符合「一國兩制」政策，不可違反《基本法》；",
            "（2）第二，在運作上必須可行及有效；",
            "（3）第三，在保安方面必須能夠有效處理保安風險，防止出現保安漏洞。",
