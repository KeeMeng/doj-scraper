            "Following is the speech delivered by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, at the Hong Kong Legal Services Forum in Qingdao today (September 16) (English translation):",
            "Distinguished Vice Mayor Mr Liu Mingjun, distinguished guests, members of the legal profession, ladies and gentlemen,",
            "Good morning. Welcome to the Hong Kong Legal Services Forum.",
            "Hong Kong and Qingdao not only have a lot in common, they also have a close relationship. Qingdao is the economic centre of Shandong, which lies in the Bohai Bay economic region, and an important window for the opening up of the country. Both Hong Kong and Qingdao are major ports of China enjoying a flourishing maritime trade and shipping business. Hong Kong is also Shandong's largest source of foreign direct investment. In September 2002, the Department of Justice (DoJ) of Hong Kong and the Qingdao Municipal Justice Bureau signed the Legal Services Co-operation Agreement, which is the first legal services co-operation agreement Hong Kong has signed with a Mainland city. Since then, both sides have maintained close liaison and co-operation.",
            "Together with its co-organisers, the DoJ hosts the third Hong Kong Legal Services Forum entitled \"Think Global, Think Hong Kong\" in Qingdao for the legal and dispute resolution services sectors of Hong Kong to share their experience with their counterparts and enterprises in Shandong and to strengthen co-operation. Apart from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Law Society of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC), and the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (Asia Office), we have a new co-organiser this year in the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) Hong Kong Arbitration Center, established in Hong Kong in 2012.",
            "The past decade or so witnessed a drastic change in the macro-economic environment of the Mainland and the world. With the shift of global economic balance from the West to the East, the Asia Pacific region, in particular the Mainland, has become the top destination for investors in recent years. As Mainland enterprises continue to \"go global\", the questions of how to deal with the risks of offshore financing and cross-boundary mergers and acquisitions, and how to effectively protect their overseas investment assets and properly resolve cross-boundary commercial disputes in the face of complicated international commercial rules and legal landscape, are topics of common interest.",
            "Very often, traditional litigation in courts cannot fully satisfy the needs of international businessmen who seek to effectively resolve cross-boundary commercial disputes, and international commercial arbitration and mediation have become the mainstream modes of resolving international commercial disputes.",
            "Hong Kong is an international financial and commercial centre, as well as an international arbitration centre. Given the common culture we share with the Mainland as well as the close geographical proximity, Hong Kong is an ideal neutral arbitration venue for Mainland and foreign enterprises. Under the principle of \"One Country, Two Systems\" enshrined in the Basic Law, Hong Kong continues to maintain its common law system, which is familiar to the international community, and is the only place within the entire Greater China region that applies common law. Rich in experience in international business law, our legal professionals and dispute resolution practitioners can provide high-end legal and dispute resolution services in various areas. Thanks to our excellent geographical location, advanced telecommunication networks and flourishing business opportunities, many renowned international law firms have set up branch offices in Hong Kong. All in all, the legal professions of Hong Kong are fully experienced and capable of providing clients with diversified professional legal and related services.",
            "Besides, we have been working continuously to enhance our arbitration and trade laws. On the basis of the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, the current Arbitration Ordinance adopts a generally familiar international arbitration regime. We also keep a close eye on developments in the arbitration sector. Earlier on, we amended the Arbitration Ordinance so that any emergency arbitral award granted by an emergency arbitrator is enforceable under the Arbitration Ordinance. The Companies Ordinance, which came into force in March 2014, also further enhances corporate governance and facilitates business.",
            "Hong Kong has been a legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia Pacific region for years. We strive to attract suitable international legal organisations and arbitration institutions to set up offices in Hong Kong. Apart from the HKIAC established in 1985, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce set up a branch of its secretariat in Hong Kong in 2008, which is the first secretariat outside its headquarters in Paris. Likewise, the CIETAC established its first arbitration centre outside the Mainland in Hong Kong in September 2012. The China Maritime Arbitration Commission (CMAC) has also agreed to set up a branch office in Hong Kong in November 2014. As in the case of the CIETAC Hong Kong Arbitration Center, this will be the first branch office of the CMAC outside the Mainland. In December 2012, the Hague Conference on Private International Law also set up its Asia Pacific Regional Office in Hong Kong. In addition, our Central People's Government has concluded the negotiation of a host country agreement with the internationally renowned Permanent Court of Arbitration to facilitate the conduct of dispute settlement proceedings in Hong Kong. This will help attract more investment arbitrations in Hong Kong.",
            "Enforceability of arbitral awards is a very important consideration when parties consider where to arbitrate. Arbitral awards made in Hong Kong are already enforceable in the jurisdictions of 150 Contracting States under the New York Convention. The extensive enforcement network is one of the main reasons for parties to choose conducting arbitration in Hong Kong.",
            "Apart from arbitration, Hong Kong is striding briskly in promoting and developing mediation. The Mediation Ordinance came into operation in January 2013, and we believe that it will help promote a wider and more effective use of mediation in Hong Kong to resolve disputes. The Ordinance provides a legal framework with emphasis on the protection of confidentiality of the mediation process. In August 2012, the Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association was incorporated, with one of its functions as establishing an effective accreditation system for ensuring the quality of mediators. This in turn will strengthen the mediation services available in Hong Kong. In March this year, the DoJ held a \"Mediation Week in Hong Kong\" with a two-day conference under the theme \"Mediate First for a Win-Win Solution\". More than 1,000 local and overseas professionals from the legal and mediation sectors, academics, and representatives of business associations and professional organisations attended the conference. They exchanged views and shared experience on the latest situation and future developments on a global scale, and the use of mediation to resolve disputes in different sectors was discussed.",
            "The expansion of legal and dispute resolution services, particularly international arbitration services, not only contributes to business development but overall national development as well. Conventional international rules for trade and arbitration were drawn up under the influence of the West. Today, the development of international trade and arbitration in the Asia Pacific region is entering a golden age. Let's join hands in promoting the development of international arbitration so that our nation will have a greater say and influence in the international law and arbitration community.",
            "The Forum today will create an excellent opportunity for fostering future co-operation. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the People's Governments of Shandong Province and Qingdao Municipality and all co-organisers and supporting organisations, including the Higher People's Court of Shandong Province and the Qingdao Intermediate People's Court, the justice and commerce authorities and the intellectual property offices of Shandong Province and various municipalities like Qingdao as well as the lawyers associations and arbitration commissions. Last but not least, I would like to thank all the guest speakers and each of you who participate in the Forum.",
            "On that note, may I wish the Forum great success. Thank you.",

            "以下為律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（九月十六日）在山東省青島市出席「香港法律服務論壇」的致辭全文︰",
            "尊敬的劉明君副市長、尊敬的各位嘉賓、各位法律界的同業、女士們、先生們：",
            "早上好！歡迎各位出席今天的「香港法律服務論壇」。",
            "香港與青島不單有相同的地方，關係也一直十分密切。山東省位處渤海經濟區，而青島市是山東省的經濟重心，也是國家對外開放的重要窗口。香港與青島市同樣是國家主要港口，海商貿易及航運業也發展得非常好。此外，香港是山東最大的外商直接投資來源地。香港律政司與青島市司法局在二○○二年九月已簽訂「法律服務合作協議」，也是香港跟內地城市簽訂的第一份法律服務合作協議。從此，雙方一直保持良好的聯繫和合作。",
            "律政司與各協辦機構這次在青島舉辦第三屆香港法律服務論壇，主題為「邁向全球首選香港」，讓香港的法律和解決爭議服務業人士與山東省的同行及企業分享經驗，深化合作。這次論壇協辦機構除了香港貿易發展局、香港大律師公會、香港律師會、香港國際仲裁中心及國際商會國際仲裁院亞洲事務辦公室外，更加入了二○一二年在香港設立的中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會香港仲裁中心。",
            "在過去十多年，內地和世界經濟的大環境發生了很大的變化，全球的經濟重心由西方轉移到東方，亞太地區特別是內地是近年投資者首選的地方。隨內地企業不斷「走出去」，面對繁複的國際商務規則及法律環境，企業如何處理境外融資、跨境併購的風險，有效保障海外投資資產，完善解決跨境商業糾紛，是大家共同關注的話題。",
            "對從事國際商貿的人來說，要有效地解決跨境商業糾紛，傳統的法院訴訟很多時候已不能完全滿足他們的需求，而國際商業仲裁及調解已成為解決國際商業糾紛的主流方式。",
            "香港是國際金融和商貿中心，也是國際仲裁中心，與內地文化相通，地理位置相近，可為內地和國外企業提供理想的中立仲裁地。香港在《基本法》「一國兩制」的原則下，繼續採用國際熟悉的普通法制度，是整個大中華區之內唯一採用普通法的地方。香港的法律與解決爭議專業人士，擁有豐富的國際商業法經驗和高端的專業水平，可以提供不同領域的法律和解決爭議服務。由於香港優越的地理環境、先進的通訊網絡和蓬勃的商機，不少有名的國際律師行也在香港設有分行。總的來說，香港的法律界有充分的經驗和水平，為客戶提供多元化的專業法律及相關服務。",
            "此外，我們不斷完善香港的仲裁及商貿法例，現行的《仲裁條例》，以聯合國國際貿易法委員會的《國際商事仲裁示範法》為基礎，採用一套廣為熟悉的國際仲裁制度。我們也密切留意仲裁界的發展，香港於早前修訂《仲裁條例》，從而令緊急仲裁員所批准的緊急裁決可按照《仲裁條例》強制執行。在今年三月生效的《公司條例》，也進一步優化企業管治，便利企業營商。",
            "香港多年來也是亞太區域的法律和解決爭議服務中心。我們積極吸引合適的國際法律和仲裁機構在香港設立辦事處。除了在一九八五年設立的香港國際仲裁中心外，國際商會的國際仲裁院於二○○八年在香港設立秘書處分處，成為其巴黎總部以外設立的第一個秘書處分處。中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會（貿仲委）也在二○一二年九月在香港設立首個內地以外的仲裁中心。此外，中國海事仲裁委員會也同意在二○一四年十一月在香港設立分處，與貿仲委香港仲裁中心一樣，該分處將會是中國海事仲裁委員會首個設於內地以外的分處。二○一二年十二月，海牙國際私法會議在香港設立亞太區域辦事處。此外，中央政府與國際知名的常設仲裁法院已完成東道國協定的商談。有關的協定利便在香港處理常設仲裁法院的投資仲裁個案，這將有助吸引更多投資仲裁個案在香港處理。",
            "當事人選擇在哪一個地方進行仲裁的時候，仲裁裁決是否可以得到有效執行是非常重要的考慮因素。在香港作出的仲裁裁決，現在已可根據《紐約公約》在一百五十個地方執行。這個龐大的執行網絡，是很多當事人選擇在香港進行仲裁的主要原因之一。",
            "除仲裁以外，香港也大力提倡和發展調解服務。《調解條例》已經於二○一三年一月起實施，相信可以推動香港更廣泛和有效地使用調解處理爭議。《條例》訂定了一套法律框架，當中特別重保障調解過程的保密性。二○一二年八月，「香港調解資歷評審協會」成立。該協會的其中一個功能，是確立一個有效的資格評審制度，確保調解員的素質，從而鞏固香港的調解服務。今年三月律政司主辦了「香港調解週」。當中為期兩天的「調解為先互利雙贏」的研討會更吸引共一千多名香港及外地的法律及調解專業人士、學者、商會和專業團體的代表出席研討會，就全球的最新情況和未來發展，以及利用調解來解決不同界別的爭議交流意見和分享經驗。",
            "擴展法律服務和解決爭議服務，特別是國際仲裁，不單是業務發展，更涉及國家的整體發展。傳統的國際商貿和仲裁規例，全都是受西方國家的影響。現在我們面對亞太區國際商貿及仲裁的黃金時代。我希望我們可以共同積極發展國際仲裁，從而令國家在國際法律與仲裁的舞台加強話語權和影響力。",
            "今天的論壇將為我們的未來合作，創造良好的契機。我謹此向山東省及青島市人民政府和所有協辦及支持單位和機構，包括山東省高級人民法院及青島市中級人民法院、山東省及青島等多個市的司法機關、商務機關和知識產權局、及律師協會和仲裁委員會，表示衷心的感謝。還有，我也感謝各位發言嘉賓，和出席論壇的每一位朋友。",
            "最後，我祝願論壇成功舉行。謝謝各位。",
