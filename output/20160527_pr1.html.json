            "Mr Yuen will speak at the opening ceremony of the Court-Connected Mediation Center. Established by the Shenzhen Qianhai Cooperation Zone People's Court, the Court-Connected Mediation Center is responsible for mediation before and during litigation. The centre will introduce a neutral third-party evaluation mechanism for cases involving Hong Kong parties, under which a neutral third party will, according to the circumstances of cases, help clarify the applicable Hong Kong laws, the evidence needed and the possible verdicts from a neutral and professional point of view. As a result, both parties concerned can better identify and understand the Hong Kong legal issues involved so as to narrow the disputes between them. The parties can also make an informed decision on resorting to conciliation or other reasonable means to resolve disputes. The centre will engage Hong Kong mediators in mediation.",
