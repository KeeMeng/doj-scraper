            "In view of the latest epidemic developments, the deadline for application for the LawTech Fund (the Fund), established by the Government under the second round of the Anti-epidemic Fund, will be extended for six weeks to September 6 to allow more time for eligible law firms and chambers to prepare for the applications.",
            "The Fund has been open for applications since April and aims to assist some small and medium-size law firms and barristers' chambers in procuring and upgrading information technology systems and arranging for their staff to attend lawtech training courses. Law firms or chambers which have five or fewer practising lawyers as at April 8, 2020 (the date of announcing the establishment of the Fund), and at the time of granting the subsidy, will be eligible for reimbursement for an amount of up to $50,000. Around 400 applications have been received so far.",
            "The Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association have established a Joint Committee to process and assess the applications for the Fund, as well as to arrange the disbursement of the funding.
