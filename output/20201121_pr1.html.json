Through an armchair discussion, speakers from diverse backgrounds including law, mediation, teaching and social work discussed the use of mediation for disputes in the school context. There was also a sharing session by the winning students of the competition on their essays and their views on resolving conflicts amicably. The seminar ended with a Prize Presentation Ceremony.",

It was hoped that through the seminar, students, parents, teachers and other education workers could all gain an in-depth understanding of mediation and the values behind it, thereby developing a positive and constructive approach in respect of conflict resolution for school disputes.",
