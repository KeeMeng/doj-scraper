            "The rule of law is one of the most important core values of our society and the cornerstone of our success as a safe, fair and just community, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said today (June 21).",
            "Mr Yuen was officiating at the opening ceremony of Prosecution Week 2013, organised by the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice. The theme for this year is \"ROLE\", which stands for \"Rule of Law Enforced\". Its purpose is to promote community awareness of the rule of law in the context of the criminal justice system as well as to emphasise the role citizens can play in furthering the interest of criminal justice.",
            "\"Each of us should strive to uphold rule of law at all times and with firm commitment. Disrespect for the law is disrespect for our values, our way of life, our community and, most importantly, each other,\" he said.",
            "Mr Yuen pointed out that Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that the Department of Justice \"shall control criminal prosecution, free from any interference\". In performing this very important role, prosecutors of the Department of Justice always use their best endeavours to ensure that justice is done, and is seen to be done, at all times.",
            "\"Prosecutions are handled in accordance with the established policy guidelines, namely 'the Statement of the Prosecution Policy and Practice'. Only cases with a reasonable prospect of success of conviction are placed before the court.",
            "\"Further, cases will only be proceeded with by way of prosecution if it is in the public interest to do so. Prosecution decisions are always made and taken forward in a fair, independent and objective manner. The Department of Justice does not and will not allow any form of interference in the prosecution work.\" Mr Yuen said.",
            "The Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Kevin P Zervos, SC, said at the ceremony that it is important for the prosecution service to actively seek to increase the public's knowledge and awareness of the criminal justice system and the role and work of the prosecution service. \"Taking the mystique out of the law and enabling the public to better understand it will go a long way to help the public feel assured about the criminal justice process.\"",
            "Mr Zervos also highlighted the concept that \"the law is for the people\". \"It is there to look after all our interests and to provide for a fair and just society for all of us. It therefore needs the respect and commitment of all of us in order to work,\" he said.",
            "Prosecution Week 2013 runs from today until June 28. During the week, activities including guided visits to the Prosecutions Division, the Jockey Club Drug InfoCentre and High Court, school talks on criminal law justice, as well as photo and poster competitions, will be organised to promote better understanding of the rule of law among members of the public.",
            "Among others, the Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, Mr Paul Shieh, SC, and Vice-President of the Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Stephen Hung, also attended today's event.",

            "律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（六月二十一日）表示，法治是香港社會最重要的核心價值之一，也是我們這個安全、公平、公正的社會賴以成功的基石。",
            "袁國強今日為「檢控週2013」主持開幕儀式。該項活動由律政司刑事檢控科主辦，今年的主題是「秉行法治各飾角色」，意思是在維護法治方面，每個市民均有其角色。這項活動的目的是增進市民在刑事司法制度範疇下對法治的認識，並重在加強對刑事司法的認知上市民可擔當的角色。",
            "袁國強說︰「我們每個人都應時刻竭盡所能，堅定不移地維護法治。不尊重法律，就是不尊重我們的核心價值、我們的生活方式、我們的社會，而最重要的，是不尊重他人。」",
            "他指出《基本法》第六十三條規定，律政司「主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉」。律政司的檢控人員在執行這項重要的工作時，時刻致力確保秉行公義，並加以彰顯。",
            "袁國強說︰「我們一直按照既定的政策指引，即《檢控政策及常規》，處理檢控工作，並只會對有合理達至定罪機會的案件進行檢控。」",
            "「此外，對案件提出檢控的先決條件，是檢控必須符合公眾利益。我們一直以公正、獨立和客觀的態度作出檢控決定。律政司不會容許檢控工作受到任何形式的干擾。」",
            "刑事檢控專員薛偉成資深大律師在開幕儀式上表示，積極加強市民對刑事司法制度、檢控工作及其角色的知識及認知，至為重要。他說︰「消除法律的神秘感，並讓市民多了解法律，都會有助加強市民對刑事司法程序的信心。」",
            "薛偉成亦強調「法律為人」的概念，他說︰「法律是為了保障我們的利益及維持公平、公義的社會，故此需要我們的尊重和支持，才能發揮作用。」",
            "「檢控週2013」由今日至六月二十八日舉行，舉辦的活動包括參觀刑事檢控科、賽馬會藥物資訊天地及高等法院的導賞團﹔學校講座介紹刑事法律和司法﹔以及攝影及海報設計比賽，以提高市民對法治的認識。",
            "今日出席的嘉賓，還有香港大律師公會主席石永泰資深大律師和香港律師會副會長熊運信。",
