            "The Department of Justice will continue to uphold its long-standing commitment in ensuring a fair and effective administration of the criminal justice system for the welfare and benefit of all the people of Hong Kong, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, said today (July 7).",
            "Mr Yuen was officiating at the launch ceremony of the first Prosecution Week organised by the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice this morning. The event aims to promote Hong Kong's criminal justice system and enhance public awareness in the enforcement of the rule of law.",
            "Mr Yuen said that prosecution decisions will continue to be made and taken forward in a fair, proper and competent manner, in accordance with the established policy guidelines, namely \"the Statement of Prosecution Policy and Practice\". The Prosecutions Division in most cases exercised on behalf of the Department of Justice the discretion whether or not to bring prosecutions. In the performance of this important role, they aimed at ensuring that justice is done, and seen to be done, at all times.",
            "\"The Prosecution Week 2012, which is a first for Hong Kong, is an innovative initiative to further promote transparency of the work of the Prosecutions Division and the rule of law.",
            "\"I am sure that the Prosecution Week, which has the full support of the Bar Association and the Law Society, will provide a platform for closer links with the public, and help increase accessibility, openness, transparency and accountability of the criminal justice system to the community as a whole,\" Mr Yuen said.",
            "Speaking at the ceremony, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Kevin Zervos, SC, said that the duty of the prosecutor was to make just decisions, without fear or favour and to be independent and free from any interference.",
            "\"It is important as prosecutors that we maintain a high level of professional competency and do our job in a firm, but fair manner.",
            "\"As a public prosecutor it is important that we remember our public responsibility and our obligations to the public. Reaching out to the public, promoting greater awareness of our work with the public and involving the public in the criminal justice system is an important initiative in strengthening the rule of law in Hong Kong,\" Mr Zervos said.",
