            "The Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam; the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC; and the Secretary for Justice (designate), Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, met the media this morning (January 5). Following are the opening remarks by Ms Cheng:",
            "Let me now say a few words in English.",
            "I am deeply honoured to be appointed as the Secretary for Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. I would like to express my thanks to the Chief Executive and the Central People's Government for their trust in the nomination and appointment of me to this very important post.",
            "The Secretary for Justice is the head of the Department of Justice, serving as the principal legal adviser to the Chief Executive, the various government bureaux, departments and agencies. We also control the criminal prosecution without any interference, and another task that we take on board is that of protecting public interest. The prime mission of the Secretary for Justice is to uphold the rule of law.",
            "Hong Kong has returned to the Mainland for 20 years now. \"One country, two systems\" is the most favourable and appropriate arrangement for Hong Kong. However, as we know, during its implementation, there have been situations whereby some unprecedented legal challenges have arisen. \"One country, two systems\" is an innovative constitutional arrangement in unitary states. And for that reason, I can understand at times people may have different views about \"one country, two systems\" and perhaps also the Basic Law. However, if we insist on applying legal principles, objectively and rationally analyse the Basic Law, which is promulgated by the National People's Congress in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, we will ultimately arrive at the same legal conclusion.",
            "Over the years, I have taken part in a number of public services in the legal as well as the non-legal sector. At this point in time, and in this very occasion, the fact that I am appointed as the Secretary for Justice in this new post gives me a great honour, but also provides me challenge so that I can continue to serve the society of Hong Kong. With the same conviction as always, I will do my best, using my professional knowledge and experience to serve and contribute to Hong Kong.",
            "Last but not least, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for Rimsky’s contribution to Hong Kong that we have all been able to see through his hard work, dedication and devotion. Thank you very much.",

            "香港已回歸祖國二十年。「一國兩制」對香港是一個最適合和最有利的安排，但在落實時，的確遇到一些從未遇見過的新的法律挑戰。但是「一國兩制」其實是一個在單一體制國家下一個創新的憲制安排。所以，有時候社會對《基本法》、對「一國兩制」的理解有所不同，是可以理解的。但只要我們堅持以法律原則，客觀理性分析人大（全國人民代表大會）按照中國憲法制定的《基本法》，我相信我們最終會取得一致的法律結論。",
            "過往多年，我在香港不同的範疇包括法律或法律以外的範疇均擔任一些公職。在這時刻，我能夠在這新崗位繼續為香港服務，對我來說既是一份榮譽，亦是一個挑戰。但是我會用一向的信心和信念，就是會盡我所能，以我的專業知識和經驗，貢獻香港社會。",
