            "Following is the translation of a speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, on the resumption of the Second Reading debate on the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill in the Legislative Council meeting today (November 26):",
            "Mr President,",
            "The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill I introduced to this Council in March this year has been examined in detail by the Bills Committee chaired by the Hon Kenneth Leung. I would take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Hon Kenneth Leung, members of the Bills Committee and deputations for their valuable opinions.",
            "As I said when introducing the Bill into this Council, the Bill seeks to implement the recommendations of the Report on Privity of Contract published by the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong in September 2005, so as to reform the common law doctrine of privity of contract.",
            "Under the common law doctrine of privity, a person not a party to a contract (i.e. a \"third party\") cannot acquire or enforce rights under the contract. This doctrine has long been criticised as incapable of giving effect to contracting parties' intention to confer benefit a third party and thereby giving rise to injustice or inconvenience in respect of the third parties' rights.",
            "The Bill enables contracting parties to confer enforceable contractual rights on a third party if they so wish. Simply put, if it is the contracting parties' intention to allow a third party to enforce the contract, the Bill would give effect to the contracting parties' intention and provide the third party with a more direct legal means to enforce the contract. If the contracting parties do not wish the Bill to be applicable to the contract, they would be at liberty to make such a provision in the contract.",
            "The Bill will further enhance Hong Kong's contractual law regime and align it with those of the other major common law jurisdictions, including England, Australia and New Zealand.",
            "Proposed amendments",
            "I shall move a couple of Committee Stage Amendments (CSAs) later. The CSAs have all been endorsed by the Bills Committee. I will briefly outline them.",
            "Clause 3(2) of the Bill excludes a number of types of contracts from the application of the new legislative scheme. One such type of contracts is a covenant relating to land which includes a deed of mutual covenant. Since a deed of mutual covenant may contain provisions not relating to land, we propose to amend Clause 3(2) so as to clarify that all provisions in a deed of mutual covenant as well as a covenant relating to land are to be excluded from the application of the Bill.",
            "In addition, we propose a very minor amendment to the English text of Clause 8(2) so as to improve the presentation of that sub-clause.",
            "Conclusion",
            "President, as I pointed out earlier, the Bill, when enacted, will enhance Hong Kong's contractual law regime. The contents of the Bill will be further improved with our proposed amendments.",
            "With these remarks, I urge Members to support the Second Reading of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill and endorse the amendments proposed by the Administration at the subsequent Committee Stage.",
            "Thank you, Mr President.",

            "以下是律政司司長袁國強資深大律師今日（十一月二十六日）在立法會會議上動議恢復二讀辯論《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》的發言全文：",
            "主席：",
            "我在今年三月向立法會提交《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》。由梁繼昌議員擔任主席的法案委員會已詳細審議該《條例草案》。我謹在此衷心感謝梁繼昌議員、各法案委員會委員及有關團體的寶貴意見。",
            "正如我在提交《條例草案》時指出，《條例草案》的目的，是落實香港法律改革委員會在二○○五年九月發表的《立約各方的相互關係報告書》中，有關改革普通法下合約各方相互關係原則的建議。",
            "根據普通法的相互關係原則，非合約一方的人士（第三者）不能根據合約而取得或強制執行合約下的權利。這原則往往令合約各方不能實現令第三者受惠的意願，引致對第三者權利造成不公平或不方便的情況，因此一直受到批評。",
            "《條例草案》容許合約各方按其意願賦予第三者可強制執行的合約權利。簡而言之，假如合約各方的用意是容許第三者可強制執行合約，則《條例草案》可落實合約各方的意願，為第三者提供更直接的法律途徑，強制執行合約。如合約各方不希望《條例草案》的條文適用於合約，則可在合約內訂明。",
            "《條例草案》不但能夠進一步完善香港的合約法制度，更可令香港的合約法與其他主要普通法司法管轄區（包括英國、澳洲和新西蘭等）的有關法律看齊。",
            "稍後我會動議兩項委員會審議階段修正案。這些修正案全部獲法案委員會同意。我現作簡單介紹。",
            "《條例草案》第3（2）條訂明新的法律規定不適用於某些類別的合約，其中一類合約是關乎土地的契諾，包括公契。但由於公契可能載有並非關乎土地的條款，因此我們建議修訂《條例草案》第3（2）條，以明確將公契中所有條款，以及關乎土地的契諾列入《條例草案》不適用的合約類別範圍。",
            "此外，我們建議對《條例草案》英文本第8（2）條稍微修訂，務求完善該條的表達方式。",
            "主席，正如我剛才指出，若《條例草案》獲得通過後，將有助完善香港的合約法，而修訂建議則可進一步完善《條例草案》的內容。",
            "我謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持二讀《合約（第三者權利）條例草案》，以及我們稍後動議的各項修正案。",
            "多謝主席。",
