            "Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse Wai-chun and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council today (December 16):",
            "Question:",
            "Recently in a speech he made, a former permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal cited several cases to illustrate that the judicial review mechanism had been abused. Besides, some newspaper commentaries have opined that politics and the laws should not be tangled with each other, and that only when the judicial review mechanism is put to sensible and proper use can it effectively check against government policies breaching the law and thereby achieve the objectives of maintaining the rule of law and good governance for the community. The mechanism should not be used as a means to deliberately impede the implementation of government policies and to hinder the commencement of infrastructure projects, thereby imposing an unwarranted cost on society. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it has, in light of or with regard to the aforesaid views, reviewed the judicial review mechanism and the threshold for approving legal assistance applications involving judicial review cases; if it has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;",
            "(2) as it has been reported that the incumbent Secretary for Justice indicated upon assuming office in 2012 that on the premise that the threshold for judicial review should be determined by judges, reviews could be conducted to explore the feasibility of further enhancing the judicial review mechanism in terms of legal perspectives and execution, of the progress of the relevant reviews and their anticipated completion time; and",
            "(3) whether it has reviewed if the increase in the number of judicial review cases in recent years is attributable to the following situation: as there are deficiencies in Hong Kong's political system and the Government have made mistakes from time to time in the approach, strategies and attitudes adopted for implementing its policies, quite a number of disputes cannot be resolved by political means, resulting in politicians from the pan-democratic parties and environmental groups (as pointed out by a local newspaper) taking an alternative approach of lodging judicial reviews repeatedly, in the hope that they will win in the disputes through lodging judicial reviews; if it has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?",
            "Reply",
            "President,",
            "With regard to parts (1) to (3) of the question raised by Hon Paul Tse Wai-chun, the Government's consolidated reply is as follows:",
            "Under the common law system, judicial review is an important safeguard to the rule of law. Through legal proceedings, individuals can seek relief from the Court to ensure that the formulation of policies and legislation by the executive authorities and the exercise of public powers are in accordance with the law and are subject to appropriate checks and balances. The Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government always respects the residents' right to apply for judicial reviews. The SAR Government will abide strictly by the rule of law, and deal with judicial reviews through appropriate legal procedures.",
            "Currently, the judicial review system in Hong Kong adopts a two-stage approach. Before the Court hears a judicial review application substantively, an applicant first has to apply for leave to bring judicial review from the Court of First Instance on an ex parte basis. The threshold for granting leave to apply for judicial review is determined and reviewed by the Court on the basis of the relevant law and public interest. In fact, in a case (Note 1) in 2007, the Court of Final Appeal raised the threshold for granting leave to apply for judicial review from cases with potential arguability to those with reasonable arguability, i.e. whether the case is one which enjoys realistic prospects of success. Under the current legal system, the Department of Justice takes the view that it is appropriate for the independent Judiciary to determine the relevant threshold.",
            "As regards legal aid, according to the information provided by the Home Affairs Bureau and the Legal Aid Department (LAD), the policy objective of legal aid is to ensure that no one with reasonable grounds for pursuing or defending a legal action in the Hong Kong courts is denied access to justice due to a lack of means. To qualify for legal aid, a person has to satisfy the means test and the merits test as stipulated in the Legal Aid Ordinance (LAO) (Cap. 91). To ensure that only those cases with reasonable grounds are granted legal aid, all legal aid applications are processed by Legal Aid Counsel appointed to serve in the LAD. In conducting the merits test, LAD will consider the background of the case, the evidence available and the legal principles applicable to the case so as to determine whether there are reasonable grounds for legal aid to be granted. In assessing the merits, LAD must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds or points of law involved for which it is desirable to grant legal aid to enable the matter to be submitted to the court for decision or judgement. For individual applications, if the available documents already demonstrate strong ground(s) for taking proceedings or that the issues raised are already covered by previous judgements or advice, legal aid may be granted to applicants who have passed the means test. If complicated legal issues are involved in the application, LAD may seek independent legal opinion from counsel in private practice on the merits of the application under section 9(d) of LAO.",
            "Legal aid will only be granted to applicants who pass both the merits test and the means test in accordance with LAO. LAD has also put in place a monitoring mechanism to ensure that the processing of legal aid applications is reasonable and to safeguard against abuse of legal aid. If an application is refused, the applicant may appeal against the decision of the Director of Legal Aid to the Registrar of the High Court in accordance with section 26 of LAO, for which the decision of the Registrar is final.",
            "With the continuous development of the community, individuals are increasingly concerned about the implementation of Government's policies in different areas and the protection of their legal rights. The numbers of challenges against the Government's policies and decisions through judicial review as well as applications for legal aids have been on the rise. We are also aware that, in recent years, some of the controversial cases have drawn much public attention and have been widely reported. Such cases have highlighted the different views of the community on the procedure for bringing judicial review applications, the time needed for disposal and the delay possibly caused by the relevant judicial review proceedings to the implementation of the relevant policies and decisions. The Department of Justice has been paying attention to the discussion in the community on the ways to improve the judicial review system as well as the relevant developments in other common law jurisdictions, and will review the need to further enhance the judicial review system as and when necessary.",
            "It is the legal right of residents to apply for judicial review and it is a right which has to be respected by the SAR Government. Meanwhile, the SAR Government will continue to seek and incorporate views of the Legislative Council (LegCo), different political parties, relevant stakeholders (such as the green groups) and the public on our various policies at an appropriate stage and on a broad scale with a view to reducing the likelihood of controversies arising after the promulgation of policies, which will be conducive to smooth governance. Amongst others, Secretaries of Departments and Directors of Bureaux will fully make use of various avenues, such as the respective Panels of the LegCo as well as attending public hearings organised by Panels to listen to and take on board advice from LegCo Members and the public, and lobbying LegCo Members' support for the bills or funding proposals to be introduced. The SAR Government will continue to work for the common good and long-term development of the Hong Kong SAR, promulgate policies for the benefit of the public, and listen to the views of LegCo Members, different sectors and the public on formulation of policies, such that the policies will better meet the aspirations of the community.",

            "以下是今日（十二月十六日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問及律政司司長袁國強資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題",
            "最近一位終審法院前常任法官發表演說時列舉數宗案例，說明司法覆核機制被濫用。報章亦有意見，應讓政治歸政治、法律歸法律，司法覆核機制唯有合理善用，才可有效遏制政府政策違法以達至法治社會和良好管治目的，而不應被利用作蓄意妨礙政府施政，以阻撓基建工程展開，令社會付出不必要代價。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）有否因應或參考上述意見，檢討司法覆核機制及批准涉及司法覆核個案的法律援助申請門檻；如有，詳情為何；如否，可否立即進行檢討；",
            "（二）鑒於據報現任律政司司長在二○一二年剛上任時表示，在由法官決定提出司法覆核門檻的前提下，可檢討在法律觀點和執行上能否進一步完善司法覆核機制，相關檢討有何進展及預計何時完成；及",
            "（三）有否檢討，近年司法覆核個案增加是否下述情況所致：香港政治體制有缺憾及政府推行政策方式、策略及態度時有失誤，以致不少爭拗未能以政治方式解決，因此（一如某報章指出）泛民主派政黨政客及環保組織另辟途徑，多次提出司法覆核，希望藉以在爭拗中取勝；如有，詳情為何；如否，可否立即進行檢討？",
            "答覆",
            "主席：",
            "就謝偉俊議員提問的三部分，政府綜合回覆如下：",
            "司法覆核機制是普通法制度下維護法治的重要一環，市民可藉著司法程式尋求法庭的濟助，以確保行政機關制訂政策和法例，以及行使公權力時根據法律行事並受到適度的監察。特區政府一直尊重市民提出司法覆核的權利，並會嚴守法治，遵循恰當的法律途徑處理司法覆核。",
            "現時，香港的司法覆核制度，採取兩重審理的機制，在法庭正式審理司法覆核案件之前，申請人必須先向高等法院原訟法庭提出單方面申請，及取得申請司法覆核的許可。批出司法覆核許可的門檻由法庭基於相關法律公眾利益而訂立及適時檢討。事實上，於二○○七年的一宗案件（注一）中，終審法院已將批出司法覆核申請許可的門檻，由案件具有潛在可爭辯性提高至合理的可爭辯性，即考慮一宗案件是否有實質勝訴的機會。在現行的法律制度下，律政司認為由獨立的司法機構決定提出司法覆核的相關門檻是合適的處理方法。",
            "就法律援助方面，根據民政事務局及法律援助署（法援署）提供的資料，法律援助政策的目標是確保所有具備合理理據在香港法院提出訴訟或抗辯的人，不會因缺乏經濟能力而無法尋求公義。任何人士如欲獲得法援，必須通過《法律援助條例》（第91章）規定的經濟審查及案情審查。為確保只有具合理理據的申請才獲批法援，所有法援申請均由法援署的法律援助律師審批。法援署在進行案情審查時會就案情背景、證據及適用的法律原則進行調查和研究，以決定是否應批准法援申請。法援署在進行案情審查時，必須信納有合理的理據或法律問題宜於給予法律援助，以期法庭作出裁決。就個別申請而言，如檔已顯示個案具備有力理據進行訴訟，或法庭過往已就同類個案所提出的事項作出判決或建議，通過經濟審查的申請人可獲批法援。如申請涉及複雜法律爭議問題，法援署可根據《法律援助條例》第9（d）條，就審批有關申請的理據向執業大律師徵詢獨立法律意見。",
            "《法律援助條例》規定，只有同時通過案情審查及經濟審查的申請人方可獲批法援。法援署亦設有監察機制，確保法律援助申請審批合理及防止法援被濫用。如法援申請被拒，申請人可根據《法律援助條例》第26條就法援署署長的決定向高等法院司法常務官提出上訴，司法常務官有最終的決定權。",
            "隨著社會的不斷發展，市民就政府在不同範疇的施政及個人的合法權利的保護有更大的關注，透過申請司法覆核及法援挑戰政府政策或決定的個案有上升的趨勢。我們也留意到，近年部分別具爭議性的個案尤其受到廣泛的關注和報導，也突顯社會對司法覆核案件的程式、所需要的時間、訴訟過程可能令有關政府政策或決定等事宜產生延誤有不同聲音。律政司一直關注香港社會對如何完善司法覆核機制所提出的意見及其他普通法地方的相關發展，並會適時檢討本地司法覆核機制是否需要進一步完善。",
            "行使司法覆核是市民的法律權利，特區政府定必尊重。與此同時，特區政府亦會繼續適時和廣泛地諮詢和吸納立法會、不同政黨、相關持分者（如環保團體）和公眾就政府各項政策的意見，務求減少政策出臺後的爭議，令政府施政更暢順。其中，各司局長會充分利用各種管道，包括各事務委員會及出席事務委員會舉行的公聽會，聽取並吸納議員和市民的意見，爭取議員對其日後提出的法案或撥款建議的支持。我們並會繼續以香港特區整體利益和長遠發展為依歸，推出利民政策，並就著政策的制定，虛心聆聽議員、不同業界和普羅市民的意見，使政策的制訂更符合社會的期望。",
