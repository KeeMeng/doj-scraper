            "Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Ms Teresa Cheng, SC, in the Legislative Council today (May 29):",
            "Question:",
            "The estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang comprises the Chinachem Group with a net asset value of as high as HK$137 billion as at August last year. The Court of Final Appeal handed down a judgment in 2015, which held that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the Foundation) was to hold the estate as a trustee rather than as a beneficiary which had received it as an unconditional absolute gift, and requested the Department of Justice to establish a supervisory managing organisation to ensure that the Foundation would operate in accordance with the testamentary intention of Mrs Wang and use the estate for charitable purposes. So far, the incumbent Secretary for Justice (SJ) and her predecessors have not submitted to the court any plan for establishing the supervisory managing organisation. Furthermore, recently, the SJ has been alleged to have failed to fulfil her duty as the protector of charities for having mishandled the over HK$10 billion estate for charitable purposes of the late \"tycoon of hourly-rated hotels\", and a lawsuit has been filed against the SJ in a bid to holding her accountable. On the other hand, it has been reported that the Executive Committee of the Chinachem Group (ECCG), which is under the direction of the interim administrator (the administrator) of the estate of Mrs Wang, recently relieved the duties of one of the members of the trustee on grounds that the person in question was allegedly involved in false investment projects on the Mainland and had allegedly divulged papers on the ECCG making \"abnormal termination payment\" to the former chief executive officer of the Group. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:",
            "(1) whether it has inquired into the various acts, in which the trustee and the administrator were alleged to have been involved, of improper use of the assets of the Foundation; if so, of the outcome, if not, the reasons for that;",
            "(2) whether, in view of the concerns of the media and the community regarding whether the estate of Mrs Wang has been misappropriated, it will make public the expenditures of the Foundation; if it will not, of any credible means in place to convince members of the public that the Government can effectively monitor the operation of the Foundation;",
            "(3) of the reasons why the incumbent SJ and her predecessors have so far not formulated any plan for establishing a supervisory managing organisation for the Foundation; when the aforesaid estate can formally be used for charitable purposes;",
            "(4) as it has been reported that an estate management fee of as high as HK$60 million per annum is being charged by the administrator, and that over HK$200 million have been charged since 2015, whether the Government has assessed the aggregated amount of management fees to be charged by the administrator before the estate can formally be used for charitable purposes;",
            "(5) as it has been reported that the SJ is considering a request of the Foundation for replacing the administrator, of the outcome of the SJ's consideration;",
            "(6) given that the SJ has been criticised for the repeated delays and impropriety in handling sizeable estates for charitable purposes and thus causing unduly long delays in putting the relevant assets to charitable uses, whether the Government has assessed if such incidents will affect public confidence in the SJ assuming the role as the protector of charities;",
            "(7) as it is estimated that the sizeable estates to be used for charitable purposes in just the aforesaid two cases amount to HK$150 billion, whether the Government has assessed the negative impact on social welfare as a whole brought about by the unduly long delays in putting the relevant assets to charitable uses; and",
            "(8) of the difficulties of and constraints on the SJ's handling of her work as the protector of charities; the strategies in place to prevent problems such as mishandling of sizeable estates and unduly long delays in putting sizeable estates to charitable uses?",
            "Reply:",
            "President,",
            "As the protector of charity, the Secretary for Justice (SJ) has the role of safeguarding charitable interests. Under this principle, the SJ can participate in the relevant legal proceedings, and assist the Court in the administration of charitable trusts. If there is sufficient information or evidence showing that a charitable organisation may have breached the charitable trust, or there is maladministration prejudicing the beneficial interest of the charitable organisation, the Department of Justice (DoJ) will pay close attention to the administration and operation of the said charitable organisation, and take such follow-up actions as may be appropriate, including seeking directions or appropriate relief from the Court.",
            "Regarding the Hon Paul Tse's question in relation to the estate of the late Mrs Nina Wang and the estate of the late Mr Yu Pang-lin, The DoJ's consolidated reply is as follows:",
            "(I) The estate of the late Mrs. Nina Wang (NW Estate)",
            "Mrs Nina Wang passed away in April 2007 leaving a home-made Chinese will dated July 28, 2002 (the Will). In May 2012, SJ, as the protector of charity, commenced proceedings in the Court of First Instance of the High Court seeking the Court's adjudication on the proper construction of the Will, in order to ensure proper management and ultimate distribution of the NW Estate.",
            "The Court of Final Appeal handed down its judgment on May 18, 2015 and unanimously held that the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (the Foundation) should hold the entire estate as a trustee and would not receive any part of the estate as an absolute gift (CFA Judgment).",
            "(1) Latest developments regarding the scheme of administration (Scheme)",
            "The DoJ has been actively following up on the Scheme in light of the blueprint laid down in the CFA Judgment on May 18, 2015, and has provided its proposed scheme. The DoJ has been in contact with the Foundation's responsible persons to discuss the detailed arrangements of the Scheme, with a view to completing the relevant tasks as soon as possible. Nevertheless, parties are unable to reach consensus on some fundamental issues. Accordingly, the DoJ had made an application to the Court on March 29, 2019 in respect of the relevant matters, to seek the Court's determination or directions, such that the DoJ may continue to complete the remaining tasks. The relevant matters concern the propriety of the Scheme proposed by the DoJ and details thereof, including the setting up of a supervisory managing organisation to monitor the Foundation as trustee. The Court has fixed a directions hearing on June 13, 2019. Given that legal proceedings have already been commenced, it would not be appropriate for us to publicly discuss any further details. The DoJ will continue to closely follow up in order to ensure the early preparation and implementation of the Scheme, in order to handle the NW Estate in accordance with the wishes of the late Mrs Nina Wang.",
            "Currently, the administration of the NW Estate is vested with the interim administrators appointed by the Court. The DoJ has also filed a caveat against a grant of probate or administration to preserve the status quo pending a scheme to be set up and sanctioned by the Court.",
            "(2) The work of the interim administrators",
            "The current interim administrators are professional accountants appointed by the Court. Their principal responsibilities are to get in and preserve the properties of the NW Estate, including making enquiries as they deem reasonably necessary or taking out legal proceedings to ensure that the NW Estate is properly preserved. Besides, the relevant work also includes handling matters arising from the operation of the Chinachem Group. As the Chinachem Group is a big business conglomerate comprising numerous companies with multiple areas of business, the relevant work activities can be very complicated. The interim administrators have been making efforts to improve its governance structure, to ensure the smooth operation of various lines of corporate business. In discharge of their duties, the interim administrators would investigate and take follow-up actions against any irregularity known to them which might prejudice the proper preservation and management of the NW Estate. The interim administrators are also required to submit periodical reports to the Court, the DoJ and the Foundation to account for the administration of the NW Estate.",
            "As \"officer of the Court\", the interim administrators owe a duty to the Court on matters relating to the interim administration of the NW Estate. The Court may also give directions to the interim administrators if and when necessary. The work of the interim administrators has all along been monitored by the Court, including the consideration of the periodical reports and other relevant materials provided by them.",
            "The DoJ has, at all times, been paying close attention to the administration of the NW Estate and has been in frequent contact with the interim administrators, including considering the periodical reports provided by the interim administrators, approaching the interim administrators to further understand relevant matters, requesting the interim administrators to take follow-up actions and provide reports as the circumstances require, assisting the Court in legal proceedings taken out by the interim administrators, and seeking directions from the Court as may be required in the course of interim administration of such estate.",
            "The DoJ has noted that certain governors of the Foundation have been suspended from their duties in the Chinachem Group's Executive Committee; the termination payment made by the Chinachem Group to its former Chief Executive Officer; the requests for the change of the interim administrators, etc. The DoJ will consider these matters thoroughly. It is not appropriate to make any comment at this stage. Generally speaking, if any misappropriation of the charitable assets by the administrator or trustee is found, the DoJ being the protector of the charity can apply to the Court for the appropriate relief (including the change of the relevant personnel if necessary). The DoJ will continue to closely monitor the interim administrators' work in managing and preserving the NW Estate, and take such follow-up actions as may be appropriate.",
            "Regarding the fees of the interim administrators, they have been prescribed by the Court in the appointment order and are subject to the Court's scrutiny. Without the Court's order for disclosure, we are not in a position to disclose such information. The DoJ and the Foundation have also been monitoring the fees charged by the interim administrators. Should the DoJ and the Foundation consider the amount to be excessive or unreasonable, an application may be made to the Court for taxation of the fees, in order to ensure that the interim administrators' fees are maintained at a reasonable level.",
            "As the protector of charity, the SJ will actively follow up on the detailed arrangements for the implementation of the Will in the light of the blueprint laid down in the CFA Judgment, including handling the court proceedings already commenced and closely monitoring the management and preservation of the NW Estate with a view to protecting and safeguarding the charitable interest.",
            "(II) The estate of the late Mr Yu Pang-lin (YP Estate)",
            "Regarding the estate of the \"Clocktel Tycoon\" (i.e. Mr Yu Pang-lin), the Court of First Instance of the High Court, with the assistance of the SJ as the protector of charity, handed down a judgment on March 8, 2018 after trial holding that the will of the late Mr Yu was valid and confirmed the trustee of the YP Estate. As the YP Estate involves charitable interests, the SJ has been paying attention to the management of the estate and will approach the trustee in order to further understand the administration of the charitable trust as appropriate.",
            "Regarding the lawsuit filed against the SJ as referred to in the question, the plaintiff alleges that the SJ has failed to perform her duties as the protector of charity. Since there are ongoing legal proceedings, it is not appropriate for the DoJ to make any further comments.",

            "以下是今日（五月二十九日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和律政司司長鄭若驊資深大律師的書面答覆：",
            "問題：",
            "已故龔如心女士遺產包括資產淨值高達1,370億港元（截至去年八月）的華懋集團。二○一五年終審法院裁定，華懋慈善基金（慈善基金）是該筆遺產受託人（受託人）而不是以無條件饋贈形式接收有關遺產的受益人，並要求律政司籌備成立監管機構，確保慈善基金按龔女士遺願運作，將該筆遺產用作慈善用途。歷任及現任律政司司長至今未向法庭提交成立監管機構的計劃。此外，近日律政司司長被質疑未履行慈善事務守護人責任，不當處理已故「時鐘酒店大王」逾百億港元作慈善用途遺產，並被入稟追究責任。另一方面，據報由龔女士遺產臨時管理人（管理人）主導的華懋集團管治委員會（委員會）近日終止受託人一位成員的委員職務，原因是該人被懷疑涉內地虛假投資項目及洩露有關委員會向該集團前行政總裁支付「不正常離職補償」的文件。就此，政府可否告知本會：",
            "（一）有否查究受託人和管理人被指涉及的各項不當動用慈善基金資產行為；如有，結果為何；如否，原因為何；",
            "（二）會否因應傳媒及社會對龔女士遺產有否被挪用的關注，公開交代慈善基金開支狀況；如不會，有何具公信力方法，讓市民確信政府能有效監管慈善基金運作；",
            "（三）為何歷任及現任律政司司長，至今仍未訂出成立慈善基金監管機構計劃；上述遺產何時方可正式投入慈善用途；",
            "（四）據報管理人每年收取高達6,000萬港元遺產管理費，而由二○一五年至今已收取逾兩億港元費用，政府有否評估在該筆遺產正式用作慈善用途之前，管理人會收取管理費的總額；",
            "（五）據報律政司正考慮慈善基金提出撤換管理人要求，考慮結果為何；",
            "（六）鑑於律政司司長被批評一再延誤及不當處理巨額慈善遺產，以致有關資產遲遲未能作慈善用途，政府有否評估該等事件會否影響公眾對律政司司長擔任慈善事務守護人的信心；",
            "（七）鑑於單單上述兩筆巨額慈善遺產估算共約1,500億港元，政府有否評估有關資產遲遲未能用作慈善用途，對整體社會福利有何負面影響；及",
            "（八）律政司司長在處理慈善事務守護人工作上有何困難及制肘；有何政策避免出現巨額慈善遺產處理失當及被不合理延誤作慈善用途等問題？",
            "答覆：",
            "主席：",
            "律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，角色是維護慈善利益。在這原則下，律政司司長可以介入相關法律程序，並可就慈善信託的管理事宜向法庭提供協助。如有充分資料或證據顯示某一慈善組織可能出現違反慈善信託或行政失當從而損害慈善組織的實質權益時，律政司會密切留意該慈善組織的管理和營運，並在有需要時作出跟進，包括尋求法庭指示或合適的濟助。",
            "就謝偉俊議員涉及已故龔如心女士及余彭年先生的遺產事宜的提問，律政司綜合回覆如下。",
            "（I）已故龔如心女士的遺產事宜",
            "龔如心女士於二○○七年四月去世時留下一份日期為二○○二年七月二十八日的自製中文遺囑。律政司於二○一二年五月以慈善事務守護人的身分在高等法院原訟法庭展開訴訟，就二○○二年遺囑條款的真確解釋向法庭尋求指示，以確定該筆遺產的適當管理及最終分配。",
            "終審法院於二○一五年五月十八日頒布判詞，一致裁定華懋慈善基金將以受託人的形式持有全部遺產，而不是以無條件饋贈的形式接收有關遺產的任何部分。",
            "（1）有關遺囑管理計劃的最新發展",
            "律政司一直積極跟進終審法院二○一五年五月十八日判詞中就遺囑管理計劃 （管理計劃）設定的藍圖，並已就該管理計劃作出建議，律政司一直與華懋慈善基金負責人商討擬備管理計劃的各具體事項，希望能盡快完成有關工作，惟雙方未能在某些基本問題上達成共識。因此，律政司已於二○一九年三月二十九日就相關事宜向法庭提交申請，以尋求法庭的裁決或指示，讓律政司繼續完成餘下的工作。該等相關事宜涉及律政司所建議管理計劃的恰當性及條文細節，包括成立管理機構以監管華懋慈善基金作為受託人的事宜。法庭已排期二○一九年六月十三日進行指示聆訊。由於有關法庭程序已經啟動，我們現時不適宜公開討論進一步細節。律政司會繼續密切跟進有關情況，以確保能盡快擬定及執行管理計劃，按龔如心女士的遺願處理有關遺產。",
            "現時，該筆遺產的管理權交予法庭所委任的臨時管理人。律政司亦已於遺產承辦處存檔知會備忘，以確保遺產維持現狀，直至法庭核准管理計劃成立。",
            "（2）有關臨時遺產管理人的工作",
            "現時的臨時遺產管理人是由法庭任命的專業會計師，他們的主要職責是查明和保護龔如心女士遺產下的財產，包括作出合理及必要的查詢或開展相關法律程序，以確保該筆遺產得以妥善保存。有關工作亦包括處理華懋集團營運上的相關事宜。鑑於華懋集團的規模龐大，集團旗下的眾多公司涉足不同範疇的業務，相關工作十分繁複。臨時遺產管理人亦一直致力改善集團管治架構，確保各項公司業務得以運作暢順。在其職責範圍內，臨時遺產管理人會調查及跟進其知悉的任何有損該筆遺產的妥善保存和運用的不當行為，亦須定期向法庭、律政司及華懋慈善基金遞交報告，交代遺產管理的情況。",
            "作為「法院人員」，臨時遺產管理人須就遺產管理事宜向法庭負責，而法庭亦有權在有需要時向臨時遺產管理人頒布指令。臨時遺產管理人的工作一直受法庭監管，包括審閱其定期提交的報告和其他相關資料。",
            "一直以來，律政司也有密切關注該筆遺產的管理狀況及與臨時遺產管理人保持緊密聯繫，包括審閱臨時遺產管理人的定期報告、進一步向臨時遺產管理人了解相關事宜、按情況及需要要求臨時遺產管理人作出跟進和匯報、協助法庭處理臨時遺產管理人在過程中提出的法律程序，以及在有需要時就該筆遺產的臨時遺產管理事宜向法庭尋求指示。",
            "律政司已知悉基金受託人其中的委員被暫停在華懋集團管治委員會的職務、華懋集團向其前行政總裁支付的離職補償，及有關要求撤換臨時遺產管理人等事宜。律政司會仔細考慮有關情況，現時不宜作出評論。一般而言，律政司作為慈善事務守護者，如發現任何遺產管理人或受托人有任何不當動用慈善基金資產的行為，可向法庭提出申請尋求適當的濟助（包括有需要時撤換有關人士）。律政司會繼續密切關注臨時遺產管理人就該筆遺產的管理和保存的工作，並在有需要時作出適當的跟進。",
            "關於臨時遺產管理人的費用問題，在法庭的委任命令經已有所規定，並受法庭的監督。由於有關命令是在非公開的聆訊作出，在法庭沒有頒令披露的情況下，我們不能透露有關資料。律政司及華懋慈善基金亦有一直審閱臨時遺產管理人的收費，倘雙方認為某筆費用過高或不合理，可向法庭提出申請，要求評定有關費用，以確保臨時遺產管理人的費用維持在合理的水平。",
            "律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人，會根據終審法院就遺囑管理計劃設定的藍圖，繼續積極跟進實施遺囑内容的具體安排，包括處理已展開的法庭程序及繼續密切留意龔如心女士遺產的管理和保存，以維護及保障相關的慈善利益。",
            "（II）已故余彭年先生的遺產事宜",
            "就有關「時鐘酒店大王」（即余彭年先生）的遺產事宜，高等法院原訟法庭，在律政司司長作為慈善事務守護人的協助下，於二○一八年三月八日經審訊後頒令余彭年先生的遺囑有效，及確立遺產的受託人。由於該筆遺產涉及慈善利益，律政司司長一直關注該筆遺產的管理狀況，並會按情況進一步向受託人了解慈善信託的管理狀況。",
            "至於問題中提及近日律政司司長被入稟一案，原告人聲稱律政司司長沒有履行慈善事務守護人的責任，由於案件已進入司法程序，律政司不適宜就此案進一步評論。",
