            "Mr President,",
            "I move that the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2013 be read the second time. The object of the Bill is to amend the current Arbitration Ordinance (the Ordinance) in view of new developments in the arbitration regime and relevant matters.",
            "Implementing the Arrangement Concerning Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards between Hong Kong and Macao",
            "Firstly, Hong Kong and Macao concluded the Arrangement Concerning Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (the Arrangement) in January 2013. The content of the Arrangement is similar to the arrangement between Hong Kong and the Mainland on mutual enforcement of arbitral awards concluded in 1999. To implement the Arrangement, the Bill will introduce a statutory mechanism for the enforcement of arbitral awards made in Macao by Hong Kong courts. The relevant provisions are similar to the existing provisions of the Ordinance relating to the implementation of the arrangement with the Mainland.",
            "Tying in with the latest developments in the arbitration sector",
            "Moreover, in view of the recent developments in the arbitration sector, the Ordinance is proposed to be amended in three aspects:",
            "(a) Firstly, since the emergency arbitrator procedure has increasingly been adopted by arbitral institutions around the world, the Bill proposes to make it clear that subject to the relevant provisions of the Ordinance and with the leave of the court, any emergency relief granted by an emergency arbitrator before the constitution of an arbitral tribunal is also enforceable. In this connection, a new Part 3A will be added to the Ordinance to provide that after having obtained the leave of the Court of First Instance of the High Court of Hong Kong, any emergency relief granted by an emergency arbitrator in or outside Hong Kong will be enforceable.",
            "(b) Secondly, section 75 of the Ordinance is proposed to be amended to provide that if the parties to an arbitration have agreed that the costs of the arbitral proceedings are to be taxed by the court, the costs are to be taxed on a \"party and party\" basis in accordance with the Rules of the High Court.",
            "(c) Thirdly, as there are four new parties (Note 1) to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (which is also known as the New York Convention), the Bill is required to amend the Arbitration (Parties to New York Convention) Order in order to update the list of the parties to the Convention.",
            "Other Amendments",
            "Finally, in light of the new provisions, the Bill proposes to make some consequential amendments to the Rules of the High Court. We will also make some more technical amendments to certain existing sections of the Ordinance to align the wording of those sections with that of the new provisions and to make those sections more readable.",
            "Views of the Professions and the Panel",
            "The various stakeholders within the legal and arbitration professions have been consulted on the proposals under the Bill. They were supportive of the proposals and their comments and responses have been taken into account in the drafting of the Bill. The Administration of Justice and Legal Services Panel of LegCo has also indicated support for the proposed amendments.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Mr President, the Administration strives to further enhance Hong Kong's position as a centre for legal services and dispute resolution in Asia Pacific. The Department of Justice has been making vigorous efforts to promote work in that regard. The Bill seeks to implement the Arrangement Concerning Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards between Hong Kong and Macao, and to make corresponding legislative amendments to tie in with the new developments in the arbitration sector. We believe that the Bill, when enacted, will help to reinforce Hong Kong's position as a leading international arbitration centre in Asia Pacific.",
            "With these remarks, I urge Members to support the Bill.",
            "Note 1: The four new parties are: Fiji, Liechtenstein, Sao Tome and Principe as well as Tajikistan.",

            "主席：",
            "我動議二讀《2013年仲裁（修訂）條例草案》。《條例草案》的目的，是因應仲裁機制及相關事宜的新發展修訂現行的《仲裁條例》。",
            "首先，香港與澳門於今年一月簽訂《關於香港特別行政區與澳門特別行政區相互認可和執行仲裁裁決的安排》（《安排》），其內容與香港和內地在一九九九年簽訂的相互執行仲裁裁決安排的內容相若。為了落實新簽訂的《安排》，《條例草案》會就香港法院強制執行在澳門作出的仲裁裁決，引進法定機制，相關條文與《仲裁條例》現時實施與內地簽訂的安排的條文相若。",
            "此外，因應仲裁界的新近發展，《條例草案》亦會對《仲裁條例》作出三方面的修訂：",
            "（ａ）第一，鑑於世界各地的仲裁機構越來越多引入緊急仲裁員程序，《條例草案》建議訂明，在符合《仲裁條例》相關規定及獲得法院許可的情況下，緊急仲裁員在仲裁庭組成前所作出的緊急濟助裁決亦可得到強制執行。為此，《條例草案》會在《仲裁條例》加入新的第3A部，以訂明緊急仲裁員在香港或其他地方作出的緊急濟助裁決，在香港原訟法庭許可後，便可以強制方式執行。",
            "（ｂ）第二，《條例草案》建議修訂《仲裁條例》第75條，訂明如仲裁各方同意仲裁費用交由法庭評定，法庭須按照《高等法院規則》，按「訴訟各方對評」基準評定仲裁程序的費用。",
            "（ｃ）第三，由於一九五八年《承認及執行外國仲裁裁決公約》（又稱《紐約公約》）新增了四個新的締約方（註一），《條例草案》需要修訂《仲裁（紐約公約締約方）令》，更新當中的締約方名單。",
            "最後，因應新加入的條文，《條例草案》建議對《高等法院規則》作出一些相應修訂。我們亦會對《仲裁條例》某些現行條文作出較技術性的修訂，務求令該等條文的字眼與新條文更一致及容易理解。",
            "當局已就《條例草案》的建議，徵詢法律及仲裁專業的意見，他們都支持建議。在草擬《條例草案》期間，當局已考慮他們的意見及回應。立法會司法及法律事務委員會亦表示支持修訂建議。",
            "主席，當局致力進一步提升香港作為亞太區法律服務以及解決爭議中心的地位。律政司一直全力推動這方面的工作。《條例草案》將落實香港與澳門兩地相互認可和執行仲裁裁決的安排，並為配合仲裁業的新發展而作相應修訂。我們相信《條例草案》獲得通過後，將有助鞏固香港作為亞太區主要國際仲裁中心的地位。",
            "我謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持《條例草案》。",
            "註一︰該四個新締約方為：斐濟、列支敦士登、聖多美及普林西比島，以及塔吉克斯坦。",
