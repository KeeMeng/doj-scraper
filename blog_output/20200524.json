            "Hong Kong has experienced social unrest with frequent violence. There is even advocacy of independence. In view of the increasingly serious situation the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is facing in relation to national security and the difficulty of the executive and legislative authorities of the HKSAR to complete on their own legislation for safeguarding national security in the foreseeable future, the National People’s Congress (NPC) has taken steps at the national level to improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the HKSAR to safeguard national security. The HKSAR Government has clearly pledged its support to the NPC’s decision. Here I wish to explain the rationale involved in relation to the Constitution and the Basic Law, and the legal instruments that are being used.",
            "First, one must understand that the NPC is the highest organ of state power authority of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Under the Constitution, Article 62 in particular, the NPC has the power to introduce laws and other legal instruments including making Decisions. As an example, the HKSAR was established under the Decision of the NPC on the Establishment of the HKSAR pursuant to Article 31 of the Constitution on 4 April 1990. As a matter of fact, the Basic Law was passed the same day as a national law by the NPC pursuant to Articles 31 and 62(14).",
            "The draft Decision to be deliberated by the NPC and the Explanatory Statement of the draft Decision have been published. The Decision is to be made in accordance with Articles 31, 62(2), (14) and (16) and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. Article 31 of the Constitution provides that “the state may establish special administrative regions when necessary” and “the systems instituted in special administrative regions shall, in light of specific circumstances, be prescribed by laws enacted by the National People’s Congress”. Article 62(2), (14) and (16) provide that the National People’s Congress exercises the following functions and powers “to supervise the enforcement of the Constitution”, “to decide on the establishment of special administrative regions and the systems to be instituted there” and “to exercise such other functions and powers that the highest organ of state power should exercise”.",
            "It is beyond doubt that the NPC has the power to make Decision relating to the HKSAR and in particular, as in the case here, to ensure that the Constitution is implemented. When making the Decision, the NPC will also comply with the laws and as clearly stated in the Explanatory Statement and the draft Decision the “one country two systems” principle is to be upheld and implemented. Based on the Constitution, the NPC can also delegate to its Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPCSC) to make laws and that is exactly what the draft Decision paragraph 6 is referring to.",
            "There are doubts as to whether the NPCSC can legislate national security laws for the HKSAR. Such doubt is totally unwarranted. National security is never part of HKSAR’s autonomy, and indeed never a matter that concerns only the HKSAR. National security affects 1.4 billion nationals and it is trite that it has to be and is a matter that is entirely within the purview of the Central Authorities. When the threats to territorial integrity, secession and subversion of a nation persists coupled with a lack of laws that addresses these, it is natural and indeed proper for the Central Authorities to take action and propose to the NPC to make a Decision and to introduce a national law applicable to the HKSAR. Such a national law is within the ambit of “defence and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the Region” set out in Article 18(3) of the Basic Law.",
            "The four areas to be covered in this national law are secession, subversion, terrorist activities endangering national security and interference by foreign political forces. These are core national security matters of any state and that is why the NPC considers it necessary to make such Decision at a national level for a national law to be introduced into Annex III and to be promulgated by the HKSAR.",
            "Paragraph 3 of the draft Decision also explicitly points out that it is the HKSAR’s constitutional responsibilities to safeguard national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity; stresses that the HKSAR should as soon as possible complete the national security legislation stipulated in the Basic Law of the HKSAR.",
            "Whilst the HKSAR is authorized to legislate national security laws, it does not preclude the Central Authorities from legislating at a national level for national security. Further as a matter of fact, the HKSAR simply has not been able to legislate at all for all these years.",
            "Upholding national sovereignty is the duty of each and every national. When there is no country, there is no home. These are basic principles that any right minded person will agree. To blindly vilify laws relating to national security is totally irrational. It is high time we grapple and address the need to legislate to protect national security and as the HKSAR cannot do it, it is not surprising that the NPC takes action at the national level.",
            "I hope the above explanation has provided some understanding of the legal basis for the two steps to be taken: the draft Decision to be passed by the NPC, and the enactment of a national law by NPCSC to be introduced to Annex III of the Basic Law to be promulgated by the HKSAR.",

            "香港經歷了社會動盪，暴力不時發生，更甚者有人竟然鼓吹獨立。面臨國家安全局勢更加日趨嚴峻，但特區行政立法機關難以在一段可見時間內自行完成維護國家安全有關的立法，有見及此，全國人民代表大會（全國人大）從國家層面進行改善香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。特區政府已清楚表明支持全國人大的決定，我希望藉此解釋相關法律文書當中所涉及《憲法》和《基本法》的依據。",
            "首先，全國人大是中華人民共和國最高的國家權力機關。根據《中華人民共和國憲法》（《憲法》），特別是第六十二條，全國人大有權制定法律及其他法律文書包括作出決定。例如，香港特別行政區便是在根據《憲法》第三十一條所作出的“全國人民代表大會關於設立香港特別行政區的決定”下，在一九九零年四月四日設立。全國人大根據《憲法》第三十一條及第六十二條（十四）通過《基本法》成為全國性法律。",
            "由全國人大審議有關建立健全香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的決定（草案）（《決定》），以及相關的《說明》已經公布。該《決定》是根據《憲法》第三十一條和第六十二條（二）、（十四）和（十六）以及《基本法》相關條文所作出。《憲法》第三十一條訂明：“國家在必要時得設立特別行政區“以及”在特別行政區內實行的制度按照具體情況由全國人民代表大會以法律規定”。《憲法》第六十二條（二）、（十四）和（十六）則訂明全國人大行使下列職權：“監督憲法的實施”、“決定特別行政區的設立及其制度”，以及“應當由最高國家權力機關行使的其他職權”。",
            "這些條文清晰說明全國人大有權就香港特別行政區作出決定，以確保《憲法》適當實施。全國人大會根據《憲法》作出決定，並正如有關《說明》及《決定》清楚指出，會貫徹“一國兩制”方針。按照《憲法》，全國人大可以授予全國人大常務委員會相關職權制定法律，這正是《決定》第六條所指的情況。",
            "有人質疑人大常委會是否可為香港特區就國家安全進行立法，這些質疑完全是毫無根據。國家安全從來不是香港特區的自治範圍，事實上這從來不單是香港的事務，國家安全影響全國十四億人民，顯然是屬於中央事權。當國家領土完整面臨威脅、分裂或顛覆，同時又欠缺法例可以妥善防範、制止及懲處，中央自然關注，並向全國人大建議就此作出《決定》，制定適用於香港特區的全國性法律。有關法律是《基本法》第十八條（三）下，屬“國防、外交和其他按《基本法》規定不屬於香港特別行政區自治範圍的法律”。",
            "是次全國性法律所針對的四個範疇，分別是分裂國家、顛覆國家政權、危害國家安全的恐怖活動，以及外國和境外勢力的干預，這些行為，任何國家都會視之為核心國家安全範疇，所以全國人大認為必須在國家層面作出《決定》，以制定全國性法律，從而列入《基本法》附件三，由香港特別行政區公布。",
            "《決定》第三段明確指出，維護國家主權、統一和領土完整是香港特別行政區的憲制責任。香港特別行政區應當盡早完成香港特別行政區《基本法》規定的維護國家安全立法。",
            "香港特區政府獲授權訂立國家安全法的同時，並不影響中央在國家層面為維護國家安全立法的權力。而事實上，香港至今仍未成功就此立法。",
            "沒有國，哪有家，維護國家安全是每個國民的責任。這是常人都會同意的基本原則。盲目詆毀與國家安全相關的法律亦絕不理性。我們是時候面對維護國家安全立法需要的問題，由於特區政府無法完成，在國家層面進行工作完全是合情合理。",
            "我希望以上的解釋能夠讓市民明白未來兩步的法律基礎：《決定》須由人大通過；人大常委會制定全國性法律，從而列入《基本法》附件三，並由香港特別行政區公布。",
