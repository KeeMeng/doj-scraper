            "Earlier this year, I signed a Record of Meeting with the Minister of Justice, Mr Fu Zhenghua, during his visit to Hong Kong. I am pleased to learn that some of the liberalisation measures in respect of legal services in the Mainland have been implemented. The Department of Justice of Guangdong Province announced the \"Trial Measures of the Department of Justice of Guangdong Province on Hong Kong Law Firms and Macao Law Firms Operating in the Form of Partnership Association with Mainland Law Firms in Guangdong Province (2019 Revision)”. The Trial Measures have been implemented on August 1 and will last for three years.",
            "The notable measures include the removal of the minimum capital injection ratio of 30 per cent by Hong Kong partner firms in the partnership associations set up in the Guangdong Province, legal practitioners from Hong Kong, Macao and Mainland can be employed in the name of the partnership associations, partnership associations may handle and undertake administrative procedure legal work and years of establishment, work performance and other qualifications of both the Hong Kong and Mainland partner law firms can be counted towards the qualification of the Mainland business of the partnership associations. These measures provide flexibility in the setting up of and employment by partnership associations.",
            "Hong Kong’s legal and dispute resolution services are highly regarded. Our legal professionals are experienced in various specialised areas of law. The Trial Measures encourage more partnership associations to be set up by Mainland and Hong Kong law firms, especially by small and medium-sized law firms, to provide one-stop shop of cross-jurisdictional legal services. This will bring more opportunities for the legal sector in the Greater Bay Area.",
            "My colleagues and I will continue to maintain close contacts with the Ministry of Justice and other departments with a view to early implementation of other liberalisation measures.",
            "Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues for their devotion in the discussions with the Mainland authorities to implement the measures. Also, my heartfelt thanks to the Law Society of Hong Kong and representatives from the local small and medium-sized law firms for their valuable opinions in making the measures more effective and responsive to the needs of the legal sector.",

            "今年年初司法部部長傅政華訪港時與我簽署了一份《會談紀要》，我很高興當中一些關於內地法律服務方面的開放措施已經成功落實。廣東省司法廳早前公布了《廣東省司法廳關於香港特別行政區和澳門特別行政區律師事務所與內地律師事務所在廣東省實行合夥聯營試行辦法（2019年修訂）》，《試行辦法》於八月一日開始實施，為期三年。",
            "《試行辦法》內值得留意的措施，包括取消在廣東省設立的合夥聯營律師事務所港方出資比例不得低於百分之三十的限制、可以用聯營律師事務所的名義聘用港澳及內地的律師、聯營律師事務所可受理及承辦行政訴訟法律事務，以及香港律師事務所和內地律師事務所的設立年限、工作業績等資質可共同作為評定合夥聯營律師事務所內地業務資質的依據等等。這些措施令兩地的律師事務所在設立合夥聯營及人事聘用方面等更有彈性。",
            "香港的法律及爭議解決服務一直備受推崇，亦擁有很多專門法律領域的人才。《試行辦法》可以鼓勵更多內地及香港的律師事務所，特別是一些中小型律師事務所，設立合夥聯營，提供一站式跨法域法律服務，為香港法律界在大灣區帶來更多機遇。",
            "我和律政司的同事會繼續與司法部及其他相關部門保持緊密聯繫，爭取盡快落實其他的措施。",
            "最後，我希望藉著這個機會感謝律政司的同事，他們盡心盡力與內地部門積極商討，才能令到這些措施得以成功落實。此外，我也想多謝香港律師會和一班代表香港中小型律師事務所的人士，他們提供了很多寶貴的意見，令我們制定措施時可以更加到位和回應業界的需要。",
