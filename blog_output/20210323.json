            "In a criminal trial, prosecutors from the Department of Justice (DoJ) play an important role in the process of sentencing. They are not only in charge of the prosecution, but also duty bound to assist the courts in imposing appropriate penalties and avoiding appealable errors.",
            "Sentencing is an essential part of the administration of criminal justice, which is exercised by the court’s independent judicial power. In the event that a defendant is convicted upon his or her own plea or is found guilty after trial, it is the court’s duty to impose an appropriate sentence, after taking into account the relevant sentencing principles, the circumstances of the offence and the background of the offender etc. In accordance with established principles, a prosecutor shall, if appropriate and necessary, provide information to the sentencing court including previous relevant appellate court decisions. However, according to case law, a prosecutor should not attempt by advocacy to influence the court in relation to the quantum of sentence (AG v Jim Chong-shing (1990)1 HKLR 131). This point may be discussed further as it has attracted some different views including from the sentencing court.",
            "After a judge or magistrate has imposed a sentence, the DoJ will carefully consider all materials of the case including the report of the prosecutor, the relevant sentencing principles and the reasons for sentence etc. If the sentence “is not authorised by law, is wrong in principle, or is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate”, the DoJ may take the case further. For example, the Secretary for Justice may, with leave of the Court of Appeal, apply to the Court of Appeal, under section 81A of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap. 221), for review of the sentence.",
            "The DoJ made 6 and 4 such applications in 2018 and 2019 respectively, compared with 17 in 2020, most of which related to the radical protests and street violence stemmed from the so-called “anti-extradition amendment bill” incident. It is noteworthy that the Court of Appeal has heard and decided a total of 15 applications (public order events) since 2020. All these applications were allowed by the Court of Appeal setting out detailed reasons and principles for its decisions in the judgments.",
            "For example, the first application was a case of desecration of the National Flag. Having carefully considered all the materials, it was concluded that the sentence by the trial magistrate was wrong in principle and manifestly inadequate. The Court of Appeal allowed the application and set out the following factors that ought to be taken into account when sentencing:",
            "(1) Actual acts to the National Flag: the desecration caused, brought about or inflicted.",
            "(2) Circumstances surrounding the desecration of the National Flag: if the acts have provoked others at the scene to commit other offences, this will aggravate the seriousness of the offence.",
            "(3) Premeditated or planned: if so, culpability is higher.",
            "(4) Joint enterprise with others: if so, culpability is higher. Even if others were only agitated to join in the course of the crime committed, joint enterprise still applies.",
            "(5) Persistent desecration of the National Flag: it is an aggravating factor.",
            "(6) The source of the National Flag: if the National Flag was obtained unlawfully, this will aggravate the seriousness of the offence.",
            "Other applications were mostly cases in relation to unlawful assemblies and violent acts. Some of the more important principles as highlighted in the judgments are outlined here so as to give the general public a better understanding.",
            "The Court of Appeal in various cases reiterated the sentencing principles as set out in the Wong Chi Fung case, which may be briefly summarised into four areas:",
            "(1) The importance of the need for punishment and deterrence: the Court of Final Appeal reaffirmed the Court of Appeal that “when a large number of demonstrators are gathered, emotions are likely to run high, or the crowd may even become agitated, so that these situations have the inherent risk of breaking out into violence” and “[o]n the basic premise that public order must be maintained, and taking into account the gravamen of the offence of unlawful assembly, the court, in passing sentence, not only has to impose a penalty that is appropriate to the punishment of the offenders, but it also has to take into account the factor of deterrence. That is to say, a sentence must not only seek to prevent the offenders from reoffending, but also to give a warning to deter others from violating the law by breaking and disrupting public order in like manner”. The Court of Final Appeal also held that unlawful assemblies involving violence, even at a relatively low degree, will not be condoned and may justifiably attract sentences of immediate imprisonment in the future.",
            "(2) The principle in (1) also applies to non-violent unlawful assemblies: to rigidly distinguish a violent or non-violent unlawful assembly in imposing punishment is impractical and in violation of the sentencing principles.",
            "(3) Emboldenment effect: if an offence is committed in public enticing others to join or have an emboldenment effect, an uproar was caused in the crowd and other offences were committed as a result, these are aggravating factors to be taken into account when sentencing.",
            "(4) Young offenders: the Court of Appeal in the case of Secretary for Justice v SWS stressed that “[i]f, as a matter of public interest, the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances of the case call for a heavy or deterrent sentence, the offender’s young age and personal background would count very little or even pale into insignificance… because the need for a punitive or deterrent sentence far outweighs the rehabilitative need of the offender”.",
            "Sentencing principles inform how sentencing is to be imposed. This is particularly important in the common law system where judgments of the higher courts bind the lower courts and where the power and duty to sentence is vested in the independent judiciary in exercise of the judicial discretion in accordance with law. In some cases, the Court of Appeal sees the need to reiterate that principles must be actually followed instead of just quoting the Wong Chi Fung case and not applying it. The judgments pointed out that “[t]he court shall act on the premise of maintaining public order”, and “[t]he Court of Appeal in Chung Ka Ho case once again extracted the legal principles in the Wong Chi Fung case to remind all parties concerned of the need to consider the gravamen seriously instead of just paying lip service to it.”",
            "Every now and then, one sees in media reports that young defendants pleaded guilty and hence convicted before the trial court. A guilty plea will reduce the sentence to be imposed but the convicted person will still have a criminal record that may affect their future, for instance when looking for jobs. Had they admitted the offence and expressed remorsefulness upon their arrest, in appropriate circumstances, the police could have considered exercising Police Superintendent’s Discretion without bringing the cases to court. Needless to say, a number of factors have to be taken into consideration by the police which include: whether the juvenile offender was under the age of 18 at the time of committing the offence; the seriousness and nature of the offence; whether the offender voluntarily and unequivocally admits the offence; whether the offender is remorseful etc. Legal representatives have a legal duty to protect the rights of these young offenders and to advise them of the merits of their cases but also the consequences of a conviction in court, namely the criminal record and the sentence. In any event, the Police Superintendent’s Discretion scheme has been explained many times by the Government and the public should be better informed of these matters now. In addition to taking legal advice, one should carefully consider all other relevant information in order to make an appropriate decision.",
            "Prosecutors of the DoJ take on the responsibility to ensure that justice is dispensed with equal measure and in an even handed manner at all times. Our prosecutors will continue to discharge duties with professionalism.",

            "在刑事案件的審判中，律政司的檢控人員擔當著一個重要的角色，除了負責提出檢控外，還會協助法庭判處適當刑罰和避免犯上可導致上訴的錯誤。",
            "量刑是刑事司法工作中不可或缺的一環，一直由法庭行使獨立司法權力來履行。法庭的職責，是在被告人認罪或經審訊定罪後，考慮案情和被告人的背景及有關判刑原則等，判處適當的刑罰。按既定原則，律政司的檢控人員在合適的情況下和有需要時可向法庭提供資料，包括以往相關上訴裁決，但根據案例（AG v Jim Chong-shing (1990) 1 HKLR 131），檢控人員不可試圖透過訟辯在判刑輕重方面影響法庭。不過這項原則引起了包括負責判刑的法庭的不同意見，所以日後可以再作討論。",
            "當法官或裁判官就刑事案件作出判刑後，律政司的檢控人員會仔細研究包括主控官的報告、相關判刑原則及法庭的判刑理由等資料，若發現「刑罰並非經法律認可、原則上錯誤、或明顯過重或明顯不足」，會在合適的情況下跟進，例如律政司司長在得到上訴法庭的許可下根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》(第221章)第81A條向上訴法庭申請覆核刑罰。",
            "在二零一八年及二零一九年，律政司向上訴法庭分別提出了六宗及四宗覆核刑罰的申請，但去年共提出了十七宗申請，大部分都是與反修例引發的示威及暴力罪行有關。由去年至今，上訴法庭聆訊並作出判決涉及公眾秩序罪行覆核刑罰申請的案件共有十五宗，律政司在所有覆核聆訊中均獲判得直，上訴法庭在判案書中詳細解釋了有關理據。",
            "例如，首宗覆核刑罰的申請是一宗侮辱國旗案，律政司經過仔細討論，認為原審裁判官在判刑原則上犯錯，而且明顯不足，未能反映罪行的嚴重性，因此決定提出申請，最終獲判得直。上訴法庭指出就侮辱國旗罪判刑時，應該考慮的因素包括：",
            "（一）被告人的實質作為：對國旗造成、帶來或引致的侮辱。",
            "（二）侮辱國旗的行為是否公開：如果被告人的行為激使在場其他人干犯其他罪行，會加重罪行的嚴重性。",
            "（三）是否有預謀或經策劃下犯案：若是，刑責更重。",
            "（四）是否夥同他人犯案：若是，刑責更重。即使只是在犯案過程中鼓動了其他人加入，仍然是夥同犯罪。",
            "（五）持續侮辱國旗：是加重刑責的因素。",
            "（六）國旗的來源：如屬非法取得，會增加罪行的嚴重性。",
            "至於其他的案件，大多數與非法集結或暴力罪行有關。以下總結了當中一些較為重要的判刑原則，令大家可以更清晰了解上訴法庭的理據。",
            "上訴法庭在多宗案件重申了黃之鋒案所釐清的判刑原則，可簡單歸納為四點：",
            "（一）懲罰和阻嚇的重要性：終審法院在黃之鋒案確認了上訴法庭的看法，「當大批示威者聚集時，很大可能會出現情緒高漲甚至激動的情況，而這種情況本身有造成暴力事件的風險」，以及「在維護公共秩序的大前提下，並且顧及到非法集結的控罪要旨，法庭在判刑時除了要對犯案者施予合適的懲罰，亦需要考慮阻嚇的判刑元素，即判刑不僅要防止犯案者重犯，亦需要以儆效尤，阻嚇其他人不要以身試法，有樣學樣來破壞或擾亂公共秩序」。終審法院亦指出當非法集結涉及暴力，即使涉及相對較低程度的暴力，在未來亦可能判處即時監禁。",
            "（二）上述指引適用於非暴力的非法集結：把非法集結分為暴力和非暴力，並在判刑時生硬地加以區別，不但和判刑原則不符，而且也沒有道理和經不起思考。",
            "（三）壯膽效應：如在場的人受到鼓動甚至基於壯膽效應而一同作案，因情緒激動起哄而干犯其他罪行，會加重了罪行的嚴重性。",
            "（四）處理年輕的犯案者：上訴法庭在律政司司長 訴 SWS案的判案書說明「若基於公眾利益的考慮，因嚴重的罪行或犯罪情況而需要判處犯案者嚴厲或具阻嚇力的判刑，其年輕或個人背景的比重將會極其有限，甚至是微不足道…原因是嚴懲或阻嚇的需要遠超過犯案者更生的需要」。",
            "判刑原則的作用是解釋如何作出量刑的決定，在普通法制度中尤其重要，判刑的權力和責任由獨立的司法機構依法行使和承擔，上級法院的裁決對下級法院具有約束力。上訴法庭在部分案件強調，法庭不單止要引述黃之鋒案的判刑原則，還必須確切落實。判案書指出「法庭須以維護公共秩序為大前提」，並強調「本庭在鍾嘉豪案再次節錄黃之鋒案的判刑原則，以提醒各有關人士須認真考慮控訴要旨、而非口惠而實不至」。",
            "媒體不時報道有青少年在裁判法院認罪後被定罪，雖然承認控罪可獲減輕刑罰，但仍然會留有案底，日後謀職時可能會受到影響。若他們當初被捕後願意認罪及表達悔意，警方在合適情況下是可以行使警司警誡，案件或許不用交由法庭處理。當然警方需要考慮多項因素，包括：犯案時是否仍然未成年、所干犯罪行的嚴重性、是否自願及明確地認罪，以及是否有悔意等。作為被捕者的律師，是有法律責任保障年輕被捕者的權利和告訴他們案件證據的強弱，但亦必須提醒他們一旦罪成所面對的法律後果，包括刑罰和留案底。政府在不同場合曾多次解釋警司警誡的安排，大家應已經對這項措施有一定認識，所以在考慮法律意見之餘，亦應該細心分析相關資料再作出適當的決定。",
            "律政司的檢控人員在刑事司法制度中肩負著重大的責任，必須要確保時刻以同等的尺度、不偏不倚地秉行公義，繼續以專業精神履行職責。",
