            "“Should the partial defence of provocation to murder be reformed? If so, why and how? If not, why not?”",
            "You may find the questions very challenging. Those who can give a cogent argument must be engaged in the legal profession for a long time. Will you be surprised if I tell you that six law students studied this topic in a comprehensive, in-depth and thorough way?",
            "The six students are in fact the winners of the Law Reform Essay Competition 2019, which is organised by the Law Reform Commission (LRC). We hope it will arouse students’ awareness in law reform and to offer them an opportunity to reflect on, and then make proposals about, what the law “should be”. The winners were each awarded a one-month or two-month attachment with a leading law firm, a barristers' chambers, a commercial corporation or the Department of Justice. I believe this valuable experience will be beneficial to their future career development.",
            "If you are interested in their essays, please go to the website of the LRC.",
            "I would also like to give you a brief introduction of the LRC. It is an independent body and considers whether, and if so, how reform of the laws in a specified area should be made. Its recommendations will be passed to the relevant policy bureau of the government to consider whether or not to accept. Last year, three sub-committees of the LRC published their respective consultation papers. It is also worth mentioning that the Sexual Offences Sub-committee published a report on voyeurism and non-consensual upskirt-photography to respond to the imminent need for the introduction of these new offences.",
            "Having set out what the LRC does, you may note that new legislation is often proposed by policy bureaux. Our counsel will liaise with the relevant policy bureau to gain a thorough understanding of the background and intended effect of the proposal. They will also provide advice on whether the proposed legislation is consistent with the Basic Law and other legal matters. Our counsel will work closely with the policy bureau in drafting the proposed legislation taking into account the policy direction. They will also assist in the legislative process.",
            "Being the Secretary for Justice and the Chairman of the LRC, I am committed to keeping our law up-to-date and will continue to closely follow up on the implementation of proposals made by the LRC.",

            "“應否改革激怒這個謀殺罪的非完全辯護理由？如屬肯定，則理由何在和應該如何改革？如屬否定，理由何在？”",
            "或許大家會覺得這個問題十分艱澀，可以提出清晰論點的人必定是從事法律行業已久。但如果我跟大家說，有六位法律學生以全面、仔細和透徹的方式探討這個問題，大家又會否感到意外？",
            "其實這六位法律學生，就是今年法律改革徵文比賽的得獎者。這個徵文比賽由法律改革委員會（法改會）舉辦，希望可以令法律學生明白到法律改革的重要性，也讓他們思考如何改革香港法律和提出建議。得獎學生分別獲派到知名的律師行、大律師事務所、商業機構或律政司實習一至兩個月作為獎勵。我希望這次實習會為他們帶來一個寶貴的經驗，對日後從事法律工作有所幫助。",
            "如果大家對他們的作品有興趣，可以到法改會的網站下載或瀏覽。",
            "我也想簡單介紹一下法改會。它是一個獨立於政府的組織，負責研究就特定課題應否及如何改革有關的法律，所發表的報告書會提交給相關決策局進一步考慮是否接納。去年法改會轄下的三個小組委員會發表了諮詢文件，另外，性罪行檢討小組委員會早前亦發表了《窺淫及未經同意下拍攝裙底》報告書，以回應社會對這種罪行的關注。",
            "以上就是法改會的工作，但很多時立法建議都是由決策局提出。律政司會向決策局詳細了解立法建議的背景和目的，就是否符合《基本法》等法律事宜提供意見。負責草擬的律師亦會與決策局緊密聯繫，根據政策方向來草擬法例，之後也會協助決策局完成所需的立法程序。",
            "作為律政司司長和法改會主席，我十分重視保持香港的法律與時並進，我會繼續積極推動落實法律改革的工作。",
