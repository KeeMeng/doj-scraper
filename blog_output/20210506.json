            "The Legislative Council (LegCo) passed the Mainland Judgments in Matrimonial and Family Cases (Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement) Ordinance (Ordinance) on Wednesday, which is a crucial step towards implementing the “Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Civil Judgments in Matrimonial and Family Cases by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region” (Arrangement) signed between Hong Kong and the Mainland. I would like to express my gratitude to the chairperson of the Bills Committee and its members as well as stakeholders for their constructive suggestions to allow us to address society’s needs promptly by concretely implementing the Arrangement.",
            "Based on statistics provided by the Judiciary, about 18% of the nearly 70,000 divorce cases filed by parties with the Hong Kong Family Court in the period from 2017 to 2019 involved marriages that took place in the Mainland, representing a yearly average of over 4,000 cases. However, Mainland law currently does not expressly provide that judgments given by the Hong Kong courts in matrimonial or family matters may be recognized and enforced in the Mainland. Similarly, judgments given by Mainland courts in matrimonial or family matters are generally not recognized and enforced in Hong Kong, save for some exceptions. Hence, there is indeed a pressing need to implement a bilateral arrangement between Hong Kong and the Mainland to provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial and family matters. Such an arrangement is in the interest of parties to cross-boundary marriages and their families as it provides effective judicial redress to the parties, as well as reducing the need for re-litigation of the same disputes, hence saving time and cost and reducing their emotional distress.",
            "The provisions of the Ordinance can be divided into three parts:",
            "(1) Recognition and enforcement of Mainland judgments",
            "A party to a Mainland judgment given in a matrimonial or family case may make a registration application to the Hong Kong District Court for a specified order (which includes: orders relating to custody and guardianship of a child; orders granting divorce and orders for the annulment of a marriage; orders relating to the maintenance of a child, spousal maintenance and division of property between parties to a marriage) in the Mainland judgment. If the court is satisfied that the relevant requirements are met, it may order the registration of the specified order. However, the other party may apply to the court for the registration to be set aside before the expiry of the specified time limit. The applicant may apply to enforce the registered specified order after expiry of the time limit for the setting aside application or after the setting aside application has been finally disposed of.",
            "(2) Recognition of Mainland divorce certificates",
            "A party to a Mainland divorce certificate may make an application to the Hong Kong District Court for the certificate to be recognized. The procedures are largely similar to those applicable to the registration of Mainland judgments given in a matrimonial or family case.",
            "(3) Facilitation of recognition and enforcement in the Mainland of Hong Kong judgments",
            "In the case of a judgment given by a Hong Kong court, a party may make an application to the relevant Hong Kong court for the issuance of a certified copy of the judgment together with a certificate, certifying that the relevant judgment is given in a matrimonial or family case and is effective in Hong Kong. This will facilitate the party in seeking to recognize and enforce the relevant judgment in the Mainland court pursuant to the Arrangement.",
            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) consulted the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services of the LegCo in 2018 and 2019 on this matter. The members expressed support for the legislative proposal. A public consultation on the proposed legislation was also conducted in 2019, during which the majority of responses received were supportive. The DoJ had engaged key stakeholders, including family law practitioners and representatives from the social welfare sector, in the course of refining the bill.",
            "With the passage of the Ordinance, parties to cross-boundary marriages and their children will be benefitted. By providing a more expeditious and cost effective mechanism for parties to apply to the Hong Kong courts for the recognition and enforcement of judgments given by the Mainland courts in matrimonial and family cases, this will reduce the need for divorce and related proceedings to be brought in both Hong Kong and the Mainland as well as mitigate the impact of a divorce on the parties to the marriage and their children and relieve their emotional stress. Very often women are the recipients of maintenance payments in divorce cases and are often the victims in domestic violence cases. By covering maintenance orders and orders for protection in cases of domestic violence, the Ordinance can help in addressing these issues and offer better protection to women and also help reduce their emotional stress. Besides, under the new mechanism of the Ordinance, in case a child in Hong Kong has been wrongfully removed to or wrongfully retained in the Mainland by a parent, the other parent can, on the basis of a relevant order made by the Hong Kong courts, seek assistance from the Mainland courts for the return or delivery of the child. This addresses the needs of Hong Kong society.",
            "After the relevant court rules have been issued, DoJ will discuss with the Supreme People’s Court for the coming into operation of the Arrangement which will take place on the same date as the Ordinance. As regards the recognition and enforcement in the Mainland of Hong Kong judgments in matrimonial and family cases, the Supreme People’s Court will promulgate judicial interpretations to implement the Arrangement.",
            "The successful implementation of the Arrangement once again demonstrates that Hong Kong and Mainland strive to foster mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters in accordance with the “one country, two systems” principle on the basis of mutual understanding and respect, so as to complement the needs that arise from social developments in both societies. The DoJ will continue to actively take forward work in this aspect. It is hoped that more good news will come in the near future.",

            "立法會在星期三通過《內地婚姻家庭案件判決(相互承認及強制執行)條例》（《條例》），為落實香港與內地簽署的《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院相互認可和執行婚姻家庭民事案件判決的安排》（《安排》）邁進了重要的一步。我必須再次感謝法案委員會主席以及積極參與的委員和持份者，他們提出了具建設性的意見，使我們得以盡快回應社會的需要，具體落實《安排》。",
            "根據司法機構提供的數據，在二○一七年至二○一九年期間，當事人向香港家事法庭提出的近七萬宗離婚案件中，涉及内地婚姻的案件約佔18%，即平均每年超過4000宗。然而，內地法律現時沒有明文規定可在內地承認和強制執行香港法院就婚姻或家庭事宜作出的判決。同樣地，除少數例外情況，內地法院就婚姻或家庭事宜作出的判決在香港亦普遍不被承認和強制執行。由此可見，兩地有迫切需要就相互承認和強制執行有關婚姻家庭案件的判決，實施雙邊安排，為當事人提供有效的司法濟助，並減少就同一爭議再提出訴訟的需要，從而節省時間和費用，減輕當事人的精神壓力，符合跨境婚姻各方及家庭的利益。",
            "《條例》的條文主要可分成三部分：",
            "（一）承認及強制執行內地判決",
            "內地婚姻或家庭案件判決的一方，可向香港區域法院提出申請，以登記內地判決中的指明命令（包括：關乎子女撫養權以及監護權的命令、批准離婚的命令和撤銷婚姻的命令，以及關乎子女撫養費、夫妻之間扶養，以及婚姻雙方財產分割命令等）。法庭如信納申請符合有關要求，可批准登記指明命令。然而，另一方也可以在指定限期內向法庭申請將登記作廢。當作廢申請的限期屆滿，或作廢申請了結後，申請人可申請強制執行已登記的指明命令。",
            "（二）承認內地離婚證",
            "內地離婚證的一方，可向香港區域法院提出申請，以承認內地離婚證，有關程序大致上與適用於登記內地婚姻或家庭案件判決的程序相同。",
            "（三）利便在內地承認和強制執行香港判決",
            "至於由香港法院作出的判決，當事人可提出申請，由有關香港法院發出判決的經核證文本及證明書，證明有關判決是在婚姻或家庭案件中作出並在香港生效，以便利當事人依據《安排》尋求内地法院承認及強制執行有關判決。",
            "律政司在二○一八年及一九年曾徵詢立法會司法及法律事務委員會的意見，委員會成員對立法建議表示支持。而律政司在二○一九年所進行的公眾諮詢，大部分接獲的意見亦是支持落實《安排》。律政司在制定草案時，與主要的持份者，包括家事法執業律師及社福界代表等，一直保持溝通以優化立法建議。",
            "現在《條例》獲得順利通過，將會惠及跨境婚姻各方及他們的子女。藉著訂立更便捷和更具成本效益的機制，使當事人可以就内地法院作出的婚姻及家庭民事案件判決，向香港法院尋求承認和強制執行，減少在香港和內地同時提出離婚及相關法律程序的需要，亦可減輕離婚對雙方及其子女造成的影響，緩和他們的情緒壓力。女性通常是離婚案件中獲得贍養費的一方，而在家庭暴力案件中，受害人也大多是女性。現時《條例》涵蓋贍養費的命令和家庭暴力情況下的保護令，將有助處理相關問題和加強對女性的保護，並減輕她們的情緒壓力。此外，在《條例》的新機制下，一旦有兒童在香港被一方父母不當地遷移到或扣留在內地的情況，另一方可以根據香港法院作出的相關命令，尋求内地法院協助交還或交付，以應對香港社會所需。",
            "在訂立有關法院規則後，律政司將與最高人民法院商議《安排》的生效日期，而《條例》亦會在同日生效。至於內地法院承認或強制執行香港的婚姻或家庭案件判決方面，將由最高人民法院發布司法解釋實施《安排》。",
            "這次成功落實《安排》，再一次證明兩地依據「一國兩制」的原則，以相互理解和相互尊重的態度，致力促成民商事司法協助安排，以配合兩地社會發展的需要。律政司會積極推進這方面的工作，希望在不久的將來可再為大家帶來好消息。",
