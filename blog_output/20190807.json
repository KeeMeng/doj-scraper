            "Last month, I stayed in Beijing for a few days to attend the second Belt and Road Joint Conference. I also took this opportunity to visit the Beijing Internet Court.",
            "With the basic idea of “online case heard online”, the Beijing Internet Court adopts an e-litigation platform and utilizes artificial intelligence technology to generate pleadings, real time voice-to-text and the basic information of judgments. Hearings are conducted through the electronic platform on which parties to the litigation are not required to appear in person. The court, integrated with intelligent technology, brings an easy access to justice to all parties.",
            "To echo with the Goal 16 of “the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals” - promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, the HKSAR Government indicated support for the development of an online dispute resolution and deal making platform. A non-governmental organisation, eBRAM (Electronic Business Related Arbitration and Mediation) is tasked to develop such a platform to provide efficient and cost-effective online dispute resolution services.",
            "eBRAM will use internet-based online platform to facilitate the provision of one-stop dispute resolution services. To ensure a smooth operation in future, the staff of eBRAM visits different places, such as the Beijing Internet Court, to learn more about the technology for e-litigation platform. At the same time, they also share their experience with institutions from other jurisdictions. Participation in the discussion on the development of online dispute resolution at APEC is an example.",
            "One of the characteristics under development by eBRAM is making use of artificial intelligence and advanced technology to provide a secure platform for the upload, download and exchange of case materials to assist parties in resolving disputes and entering into business deals.",
            "Users will be able to access the platform anywhere around the world with only an internet connection. It will not only facilitate development of local micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and legal professionals under the Belt and Road as well as Greater Bay Area Initiatives, but also create synergy with existing dispute resolution service providers.",
            "Innovative technology has greatly helped the development of dispute resolution services. I believe the establishment of a safe, reliable and credible platform to provide enterprises with cost-effective online dispute resolution services will become a new trend. The Government will continue to actively promote LawTech. We hope that eBRAM will provide a more convenient way to access to justice in a bid to strengthen our rule of law.",

            "我上月到訪北京，除了出席“一帶一路”建設聯席會議第二次會議外，亦參觀了北京互聯網法院。",
            "北京互聯網法院按照“網上案件網上審理”的基本思路，使用了在線的電子訴訟平台，並採用人工智能處理訴狀、實時語音轉成文字及撰寫判決書的基本資料等等。訴訟雙方不需要親身上庭出席聆訊，審訊會透過網上平台進行。這個融合了智能科技的法院令當事人以便捷的方式尋求司法公正。",
            "“聯合國2030年可持續發展目標”的目標16指出：“創建和平、包容的社會以促進可持續發展，讓所有人都能訴諸司法，在各級建立有效、負責和包容的機構”。為符合這個目標，特區政府支持由非政府機構eBRAM籌建一個網上爭議解決及交易平台，提供有效和便捷的爭議解決服務。",
            "eBRAM以互聯網為基礎，提供一站式爭議解決服務的網上平台。為了讓日後運作時更加暢順，eBRAM的工作人員到訪不同的地方了解電子訴訟平台所需的技術；同時，eBRAM也會與其他司法管轄區的機構分享經驗，包括早前參與了亞太經合組織（APEC）就發展網上爭議解決的討論。",
            "eBRAM現時籌劃的特點是善用人工智能和先進科技，提供一個安全的平台上載、下載和交換案件材料，協助各方在網上解決爭議和促成交易。",
            "eBRAM的用戶只需連接互聯網即可登入，讓身處全球任何角落的各方都可藉此促成網上交易和解決爭議，除了促進本地中小微企和法律專業人士在“一帶一路”建設和大灣區的發展外，亦有助進一步強化現有爭議解決機構的協同效應。",
            "創新科技對爭議解決服務的發展有莫大幫助，我相信構建安全、可靠及有公信力的網絡平台，提供具成本效益的網上爭議解決方法，會成為新趨勢，政府會把握機會，繼續積極推動法律科技（LawTech）的發展。而通過eBRAM，我們希望讓更多人能夠以便捷的途徑尋求司法公義，進一步鞏固我們的法治。",
