            "The violence and vandalism in recent months sparked a crisis of confidence of our rule of law. The so-called “justice lawbreaking” or “civil disobedience” is never justified under the law. I urge all of you not to engage in any illegal activities.",
            "The Court of Final Appeal in its judgment (FACC8-10/2017) pointed out that: (1) unlawful assemblies involving violence, even a relatively low degree, will not be condoned and may justifiably attract sentences of immediate imprisonment in the future; and (2) little weight will be given to the mitigation that the offending act was committed in the exercise of constitutional rights or acts of civil disobedience because the fact of a conviction will necessarily mean the offender has crossed the line separating the lawful exercise of his constitutional rights from unlawful activity subject to sanctions and constraints.",
            "There are suggestions that deliberate lawbreaking might be considered to achieve objectives, however, this would bring a wrong concept of the rule of law. The escalated violence and vandalism in the last few months have also undermined the perception of the rule of law among the public. My colleagues and I would promote and publicise the correct concept of the rule of law to the citizens through different channels. In analysing the current situation, I hope that we all could remain reasonable and objective by keeping an open mind, being informed and considering all relevant facts before coming to a conclusion.",
            "Our rule of law has been highly regarded, and such an achievement was not easy to come by. We should all join hands to cherish and safeguard our rule of law. Abiding by the law is one of the many obligations that ought to be observed by the public. Law exists in practice but it should not only be practised by lawyers, judges and governments. More importantly, the rule of law should be observed and respected by the community as a whole. The Government would continue to be strongly committed to upholding the rule of law.",

            "過去的幾個月裡，暴力及破壞行為不斷出現，嚴重衝擊了我們的法治。所謂“違法達義”或“公民抗命”，這些行為其實都是法律上不容許的，我希望大家切勿以身試法。",
            "終審法院在處理一宗非法集結的案件時（FACC8-10/2017），已經於判辭中指出：（一）當非法集結涉及暴力，即使涉及相對較低程度的暴力，也不會被容忍，在未來亦可能合理地招致即時監禁的刑罰；以及（二）以行使憲法權利或公民抗命之名來為違法行為求情，所給予比重將會很少，因為被定罪必然是指罪犯已逾越了合法行使其憲法權利，與被制裁和限制的非法活動之間的界線。",
            "有人提到可以刻意作出一些違法行為來達成他們的目的，這會令市民錯誤理解正確的法治精神，而近月大規模的違法及暴力行為，亦必定影響到市民對香港法治的觀感，我和律政司的同事會從不同渠道向社會大眾推廣及宣揚正確的法治觀念，同時希望大家可以理性和客觀地分析我們現時社會的狀況，在表達意見時，保持一個開明和不偏頗的態度。",
            "香港的法治得來不易，大家理應珍惜並攜手捍衛，而遵守法律就是重要的一環。法律是通過實踐得以彰顯，但不應只由律師、法官和政府實踐，而應該是整個社會共同遵守和尊重法治，特區政府亦必定會繼續致力維護香港的法治。",
