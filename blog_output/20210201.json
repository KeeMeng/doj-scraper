            "After the turmoil in 2019, the National Security Law has restored order and stability in the community. Hong Kong is now ready to capitalise on its unique position under the “One Country, Two Systems”, and the strength in legal and dispute resolution services as well as to make the best use of the opportunity brought forth by the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development. We will continue to serve as an international legal hub for deal-making and dispute resolution services.",
            "The Greater Bay Area (GBA) has the unique strength of “One Country, Two Systems and Three Jurisdictions” and the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao GBA recognises the distinctive advantage of Hong Kong’s legal system under “One Country, Two Systems” and our ability to assume a vital role in the development of the GBA. We have already succeeded in securing the Guangdong Province as the first to implement further liberalisation measures for partnership associations for law firms in August 2019. Since June 2020, such measures have been extended to the whole of the Mainland. Enterprises and investors are now able to appoint law firms and legal practitioners who are practising in the Mainland and also familiar with common law. The “Regulations of the Qianhai Shenzhen–Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone” were amended and approved in August 2020. It allows Hong Kong enterprises registered in Qianhai to choose Hong Kong law as the applicable law in their civil and commercial contracts. This early and pilot implementation measure is a major breakthrough and benefits over 11 000 wholly-owned Hong Kong enterprises registered in Qianhai. We are now actively seeking the support of the Central Government in extending the measure to the entire GBA.",
            "Hong Kong has been a prime venue for international legal and dispute resolution services. The fundamentals that make Hong Kong excel as a leading arbitration centre can be attributed to our solid foundation with a modern and user-friendly arbitration law. The Arbitration Ordinance, which came into effect in June 2011, is based on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law to unify the dual regimes for domestic and international arbitrations. Amendments to the Ordinance have been made over the years in order to keep abreast of the latest developments in international arbitration. Our arbitral service is well known for its flexibility, and the enforceability of awards in over 160 jurisdictions. It is noteworthy that nearly all the awards have been successfully enforced in the Mainland. Also, a number of well-respected international institutions have chosen Hong Kong as their first global location outside their home jurisdictions. As a result of the unique position of Hong Kong under the “One Country, Two Systems”, we are able to secure ground-breaking and game-changing arrangements with the Mainland such as the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the HKSAR in 2019.",
            "Our strong judicial and legal systems have enhanced Hong Kong’s strength as an international legal hub. Judicial independence is premised on the solid infrastructure that has been laid down primarily in the Basic Law - the security of tenure, the immunity of judges, the non-revolving door, and importantly the expressed provision in Article 85 of the Basic Law that guarantees judicial independence, free from any interference. The judicial oath, taken by all judges, requires them to safeguard the law and administer justice, without fear or favour. Judges are required to adjudicate cases based only on evidence and law, setting out how they have arrived at such decisions in opening hearings and their judgements, which are available to the general public. As pointed out by the incumbent Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, “attempts to exert undue pressure on our judges by means such as threats of violence or doxxing are as futile as they are reprehensible.” Furthermore, the former Chief Justice had repeatedly said, in particular in his interview with the media on January 5, that he categorically denied there was pressure exerted on the Judiciary.",
            "In the long run, the intrinsic strengths of Hong Kong, together with the advantages afforded to Hong Kong’s position under the “One Country, Two Systems”, initiatives and opportunities of the GBA development will reinforce Hong Kong’s irreplaceable position as a leading international legal hub for deal-making and dispute resolution services. We hope that we will join hands through concerted efforts in promotion and explanation to clarify misconceptions and misunderstanding.",

            "經過了二○一九年的社會動盪，《香港國安法》為社會恢復秩序和穩定。香港已經作好準備，充分利用「一國兩制」下的獨特地位，發揮在法律及爭議解決服務方面的優勢，以及把握國民經濟和社會發展第十四個五年規劃帶來的機遇。我們會繼續作為國際法律樞紐，提供促成交易及爭議解決服務。",
            "大灣區擁有「一國、兩制、三法域」的獨特優勢，《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》肯定了香港的法律制度在「一國兩制」下擁有與眾不同的有利條件，以及香港在大灣區發展中擔當著重要的角色。我們已成功爭取率先於二○一九年八月在廣東省落實有關合夥聯營律師事務所的進一步開放措施，由去年六月起，相關措施更擴展至整個內地，企業及投資者可委聘在內地執業並熟悉普通法的律師事務所及法律執業者。此外，《深圳經濟特區前海深港現代服務業合作區條例》於去年八月獲修訂通過，允許在前海合作區註冊的港資企業選擇香港法律作為民商事合同適用的法律。這項「先行先試」措施是一項重大突破，意味着逾11 000家在前海註冊的港資企業均能受惠。律政司現正積極尋求中央政府支持把措施擴大至整個大灣區。",
            "香港一直是提供國際法律和爭議解決服務的主要所在地。香港在仲裁方面擁有領導的地位，可以歸功於堅實的根基，與時並進及方便使用的仲裁法例。《仲裁條例》在二○一一年六月生效，以聯合國國際貿易法委員會《國際商事仲裁示範法》為基礎，統一了本地仲裁及國際仲裁的法律框架；我們不時就條例作出修訂，以確保香港的仲裁法律緊貼國際最新發展。香港的仲裁服務具靈活性，而且裁決可在超過160個司法管轄區執行，更值得留意的是差不多所有仲裁裁決均能夠在內地成功執行。不少備受尊崇的國際機構均挑選香港為其本國司法管轄區以外的首個環球所在地。由於香港在「一國兩制」下擁有特別的地位，因此我們能夠與內地達成一些突破性及重要的安排，例如二○一九年的《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》。",
            "我們穩健的司法和法律制度有助鞏固香港作為國際法律樞紐的實力。香港的司法獨立主要是建基於《基本法》訂明的穩固體制之上，即法官享有任期和不受法律追究的保障、不設旋轉門制度，重要的是《基本法》第八十五條明文保障司法獨立，法院不受任何干涉。所有法官必須按其司法誓言，以無懼無偏之精神，維護法制，主持正義。法官審理案件必須按證據和法律作出裁決，聆訊過程公開，而判決書亦會陳述理由，公眾可隨時參閱。現任終審法院首席法官明確指出：「任何威脅使用暴力或網上惡意『起底』，試圖向法官施加不當壓力的行為，既應受到嚴厲譴責，同時亦是徒然的。」前任終審法院首席法官亦曾多次指出，包括在一月五日會見傳媒時強烈否認司法機構受壓。",
            "長遠而言，香港的固有優勢以及在「一國兩制」下的有利條件，加上大灣區發展等機遇，將有助進一步鞏固香港作為促成交易和爭議解決服務的國際法律樞紐，地位無可取替。我們希望社會各界聯手加強對外進行推廣及解說工作，以澄清任何錯誤看法和誤解。",
