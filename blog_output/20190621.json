            "The Government has earlier announced that it has stopped the legislative amendment exercise regarding the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 at the full Legislative Council and has stressed that there is no timetable for restarting the process. Although my DoJ colleagues and I joined hands with the other government officials in meeting various sectors in the community to explain our proposals, there were still deficiencies in the Government's work.",
            "Regarding the controversies and disputes in society arising from the strife in the past few months, being a team member of the Government, I offer my sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong. We promise to adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements in serving the public.",
            "The Department of Justice will continue to maintain close contacts with the legal sector to exchange views on matters of mutual concern. Since I took office as the Secretary for Justice, I have put in arrangements of regular meetings with the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association to enhance our communications with the legal sector. I also frequently meet with legal practitioners as well as professionals from the arbitration and mediation sectors to explore ways to uphold our rule of law and consolidate Hong Kong as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "Last but not the least, the Government has learned a hard lesson, but we remain hopeful that the experience gained will help us work better to meet the public’s expectations in future.",

            "較早前政府已宣布停止立法會大會對《2019年逃犯及刑事事宜相互法律協助法例（修訂）條例草案》的工作，並且強調沒有重啟程序的時間表。雖然我和律政司的同事在修例一事上，與政府團隊的同事在不同場合與各界會面溝通，但我們亦必須承認政府的工作有所不足。",
            "對於過去幾個月的爭議而引起社會的矛盾和紛爭，作為政府團隊的一份子，我在此向大家作出真誠的致歉。我們會以最有誠意、最謙卑的態度接受批評，並會加以改進，繼續為廣大市民服務。",
            "律政司會繼續積極與法律界保持聯繫，就共同關注的議題交流意見。自我上任律政司司長之後，已經與香港律師會和大律師公會設立會面機制，進一步加強與業界溝通。除此以外，我亦經常與法律界、仲裁和調解的專業界別等人士見面，商討如何鞏固香港的法治及作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。",
            "經一事、長一智，政府在這件事已汲取經驗，日後必定會做好工作，正面回應社會的期望。",
