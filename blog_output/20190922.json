            "Since June, protests in Hong Kong have been non-stop and some of which sadly resulted in violence. Police have subsequently arrested a number of persons. In view of the number of arrests, the community may wish to have a better understanding of the handling of the persons apprehended. I would like to take this opportunity to explain the role of the Department of Justice (DoJ).",
            "There are different comments and views regarding the time required for making prosecutorial decisions. The DoJ must make an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and applicable law, and act in accordance with the Prosecution Code, irrespective of any political beliefs or background of the persons involved. We have all along been discharging prosecutorial duties fairly and without prejudice or favour.",
            "A prosecution would only be commenced if there is a reasonable prospect of conviction. If the defendant pleads guilty to the charge, the court would convict the defendant upon his own plea and sentence him in due course. The judicial process in such cases would require relatively a shorter period of time. There are other situations that the court, before and during the trial, may have to decide whether or not to grant bail based on the relevant evidence, the circumstances of the case, the background, behaviour, demeanour and conduct of the defendant, the nature and seriousness of the offence, and history of previous admissions to bail, etc. The defendant, having been released on bail, would have to appear in court for trial. The trial might involve testimony and examination of witnesses, hence the judicial process would take longer.",
            "It has come to my attention that there were some unfair comments on the Judiciary and refusal to comply with injunction orders granted by the court. This would severely undermine our rule of law. Our courts administer justice in full accordance with the law and admissible evidence. Judgments set out the reasons by which the decisions were reached. Some may not like the outcome but it does not mean that the independence of the Judiciary is in anyway compromised. As the Secretary for Justice, I am obliged to ensure that the independence of our Judiciary, as enshrined in the Basic Law, is respected and not arbitrarily attacked or criticised. The community should not make any arbitrary or unfair criticisms which seek to undermine the integrity or impartiality of the Judiciary.",
            "Any law-breaking behaviour, arbitrary and unfair criticisms against prosecutorial decisions made or attack on our Judiciary would undermine our rule of law. Law should not only be practised by judges, legal professionals or the government but should be observed and respected by the community as a whole. I urge that every one of us should respect the rule of law and safeguard this core value cherished by our society.",

            "由六月開始，香港出現了很多遊行示威，有時更不幸地演變成暴力破壞行為，警方採取了不少拘捕行動。由於拘捕人數眾多，社會各界或許希望對案件的處理手法有多點了解，我藉著這個機會向大家解釋律政司的角色。",
            "很多人對律政司提出檢控所需的時間有不同的看法，律政司是按證據和法律進行客觀和專業的分析，不會因涉案人士的政治理念或背景，而在處理上有所不同。我們的檢控工作，一直是不偏不倚、一視同仁。",
            "當執法機關作出逮捕後，若有充分可被法庭接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪，律政司會提出起訴。假若被捕者在法庭承認控罪，便會由法庭作出裁決及判刑，法律程序所需的時間相對較短。但亦有其他情況，法官於審理案件前或審理案件期間，綜合所有證據後，可根據案情，包括被告的背景、行為、態度及操守、罪行的性質及嚴重性、以往保釋的情況等，考慮讓被告保釋外出，被告日後仍然要繼續出席聆訊。在這種情況下，由於審訊時也可能涉及證人作供、盤問等程序，因此由起訴達致裁決和判刑的時間亦會相對較長。",
            "我注意到最近有人對司法機構作出一些肆意的批評，亦漠視法庭發出的禁制令，這會對我們的法治造成嚴重傷害。法院秉行公義，按法律及可接納的證據作出裁決，判詞內亦會陳述裁決的理據。或許有人會不滿意裁決的結果，但這並不代表司法獨立出現缺陷。我作為律政司司長，是有責任確保《基本法》內訂明的司法獨立受到尊重，不會遭受任意的攻擊或批評。社會不應該任意或不公平地作出危害司法機關公正及無私地行事的批評。",
            "無論是違法亂紀的行為，又或者是任意攻擊我們的檢控決定，甚至是無理批評司法機構，這些言行都只會損害香港的法治。整個社會都應該遵守和尊重法治，而不應該只由律師、法官和政府實踐。我希望我們每一個人都可以共同承擔尊重法治的責任，捍衛這個我們都珍惜的核心價值。",
