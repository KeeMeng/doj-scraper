            "The Chief Executive outlined the development of LawTech in her 2018 Policy Address. In my speech delivered at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2019, I also highlighted that the use of technology in the provision of legal services is an important area of development. Further to the establishment of the “LawTech Fund” and the “COVID-19 Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Scheme” under the Anti-epidemic Fund, the Department of Justice (DoJ) is going to actively explore the development of the “Hong Kong Legal Cloud” to enhance the capability of the profession to harness modern technology in the provision of legal dispute resolution services as announced in this year’s Policy Address.",
            "We share the same objective with international bodies on the promotion of the use of LawTech. At the global level, we are fully aware that a number of international and regional organisations have already been putting forth and adopting ODR service. As pointed out by the United Nations General Assembly in 2016, ODR “can assist the parties in resolving the dispute in a simple, fast, flexible, and secure manner, without the need for physical presence at a meeting or hearing\".",
            "According to a recent study by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Business Advisory Council, 94% of micro-, small- and medium-enterprises (MSMEs) reported that dispute resolution was one of the greatest challenges they face when trading across borders. Since 2017, the APEC’s Economic Committee has been looking into the issues and put forward a work plan for developing a cooperative ODR framework.",
            "Against this background, APEC’s Economic Committee, chaired by a DOJ counsel, endorsed the APEC Collaborative Framework for Online Dispute Resolution of Cross Border Business-to-Business Disputes (APEC ODR Framework) in August 2019 to encourage MSMEs in tapping ODR for negotiation, mediation and arbitration for business-to-business disputes. The ultimate goal is to develop an online platform to resolve low-value disputes across borders, which will be vital for MSMEs.",
            "The outbreak of the pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the international supply chain. Loss of business due to social distancing and other anti-pandemic measures would lead to serious cashflow issues if MSMEs are withheld payment due to disputes, endangering their survival. When face-to-face dispute resolution has been rendered ineffective under the pandemic, there is a pressing need for MSMEs to resolve disputes in a time-efficient and cost-efficient manner. An ODR platform will overcome geographical barriers and save huge amounts of time and costs.",
            "In April, Hong Kong has opted into the APEC ODR Framework, joined by more and more APEC economies. The APEC Economic Leaders jointly issued a declaration on 20 November 2020 that, “we recognise the need for continued structural reforms to improve the ways of doing business and unleash economic prosperity for our people, including accelerating cooperation on digital literacy and skills development to harness technological transformation, and encouraging the use of digital technology to resolve cross-border business-to-business disputes.” In line with the APEC ODR Framework, we launched the COVID-19 ODR Scheme back in June.",
            "The DoJ will continue to explore measures to further promote the use of LawTech. The suggestion of developing the Hong Kong Legal Cloud aims to provide secure, reliable and affordable data storage services for the local legal and dispute resolution sector, in collaboration with an efficient and cost-effective platform to resolve disputes for MSMEs, with a view to keeping pace with global changes and manifesting Hong Kong’s capacity in the area of LawTech.",

            "行政長官在二零一八年的施政報告已經提出發展法律科技，而我在二零一九年的法律年度開啓典禮中，亦指出藉科技提供法律服務是一項重要的發展。律政司繼早前建議政府在防疫抗疫基金下設立法律科技基金及新型冠狀病毒網上爭議解決計劃外，在今年的施政報告建議推行「香港法律雲端」，以加強業界利用現代科技提供法律和爭議解決服務的能力。",
            "我們積極提倡法律科技，與多個國際組織的目標一致。在國際層面上，我們注意到多個國際及區域組織推廣和使用網上爭議解決服務，正如聯合國大會早在二零一六年已指出，網上爭議解決「可協助當事人以簡單、快捷、靈活和安全的方式解決爭議，而無需親自出席會議或聆訊」。",
            "此外，亞太經合組織商貿諮詢理事會的一項研究發現，多達94％的中小微企認為解決爭議是它們進行跨境貿易時面臨的最大挑戰之一。因此自二零一七年起，亞太經合組織經濟委員會一直研究解決跨境貿易爭議這個問題。",
            "由律政司律師擔任主席的亞太經合組織經濟委員會於去年八月批准了《亞太經合組織網上爭議解決的合作框架》（《合作框架》），通過利用網上爭議解決方案進行談判、調解和仲裁以解決企業間爭議，而最終的目標是開發一個網上平台以解決跨境的低價值爭議，這項措施對中小微企來說尤其重要。",
            "疫情爆發後，嚴重破壞了國際之間的供應鏈，面對著全球各種抗疫措施，若中小微企因爭議糾紛被扣留付款而導致業務損失，嚴重的現金流問題將從而危及它們的存亡。當傳統的面對面解決爭議方式在疫情下難以進行，中小微企有迫切需要用一種節省時間和成本的可行方式解決爭議。網上爭議解決平台正好為企業克服各種地域障礙，節省大量時間和成本。",
            "香港在四月已經加入了《合作框架》，而越來越多亞太經合組織經濟體亦相繼加入。亞太經合組織領導人在十一月二十日宣布：「我們認識到需要進行持續的結構改革，以改善人們的經商方式並促進我們人民的經濟繁榮，包括強化數碼科技能力和技能開發方面的合作以採取數碼技術轉型，並鼓勵使用數碼科技解決跨境企業對企業之間的爭議。」在六月推出的新型冠狀病毒網上爭議解決計劃，正是根據《合作框架》而設立。",
            "與此同時，律政司亦繼續深入研究促進法律科技發展的措施。我們建議推出「香港法律雲端」的主要目的正是為本地法律及爭議解決業界提供安全穩妥及可負擔的資料儲存服務，配合快捷和具成本效益的平台為中小微企解決爭議，以展現香港的法律科技能力，緊貼國際的大趨勢。",
