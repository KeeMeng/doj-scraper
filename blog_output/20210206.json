            "There have been media reports repeatedly resorting to biased language to describe the appeals or reviews made by the Department of Justice (DoJ) in criminal cases since last year. I must reiterate that in respect of the sentences imposed by courts or decisions of acquittal in criminal cases, the DoJ has to carefully consider the relevant information. In the event that a sentence is manifestly inadequate or excessive, or a verdict is erroneous in point of law, the DoJ is duty bound to apply to court for a review or appeal.",
            "In the course of legal proceedings, prosecutors of the DoJ have the duty to provide accurate and comprehensive submissions on the law to assist courts in the determination of cases. On sentences imposed by courts, the DoJ will consider all materials including the prosecution reports and the reasons for sentence before taking the cases forward in accordance with relevant legislations where appropriate. In general, the DoJ may make the following decisions:",
            "(1) Apply to the magistrate under section 104 of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap. 227) to review the sentences he/ she imposed; and",
            "(2) Apply to the Court of Appeal, under section 81A of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap. 221) to review the sentences, on the grounds that the sentence is not authorised by law, is wrong in principle or is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate.",
            "When the court’s decision of acquittal in the case is perverse (meaning no reasonable court, applying its mind to the proper considerations and giving itself the proper directions, could have reached this decision) or erroneous in point of law, the DoJ may take follow-up action under appropriate circumstances, including:",
            "(1) Appeal by way of case stated to the Court of Appeal under section 84 of the District Court Ordinance (Cap. 336) for cases tried in the District Court; and",
            "(2) Appeal by way of case stated to the Court of First Instance under section 105 of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap. 227) for cases tried in the magistrate’s court.",
            "The DoJ lodged 17 applications for the review of sentence under section 81A of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance in 2020. Of the 12 such applications decided last year, 11 were allowed. On cases related to public order events, the Court of Appeal in four of the cases repeated the sentencing principle as set out in Wong Chi Fung case of the necessity to emphasise deterrence and punishment in large-scale unlawful assembly cases involving violence be applied. In three judgments delivered by the Court of Appeal, it was stressed that “[b]ecause the respondents had committed a serious offence, appropriate weight must be given to the sentencing factors of punishment, deterrence and condemnation despite their youth”. The judgments also pointed out that “[i]f, as a matter of public interest, the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances of the case call for a heavy or deterrent sentence, the offender’s young age and personal background would count very little or even pale into insignificance, because the need for a punitive or deterrent sentence far outweighs the rehabilitative need of the offender”.",
            "Some media, without regard to the grounds put forward by the DoJ at the hearings and the reasons for the decisions set out in the courts' judgments, used biased expressions that fail to reflect the facts in an objective manner. I don’t agree to this approach and have to stress that the DoJ has all along strived to ensure the proper conduct of its prosecutions. Prosecutors have always adhered to the highest of professional standards in handling criminal cases for justice to be administered with equal measure and in an even-handed manner at all times.",

            "由去年開始，有個別媒體一直利用偏頗的字眼來形容律政司在刑事案件中所作出的上訴或覆核。我必須強調，對於法庭判處的刑罰或裁定被告人無罪，律政司會仔細研究相關資料，若發現判刑明顯過輕或過重，又或者裁決在法律觀點有錯誤時，律政司是有責任向法庭提出覆核或上訴。",
            "律政司的檢控人員在訴訟過程中，有責任提出準確和完整的法律論點，協助法庭審理案件。就判刑而言，律政司研究包括主控官的報告及法庭的判刑理由等相關資料後，可在合適的情況下按法例作出跟進。一般來說，律政司可作出以下決定：",
            "（一）根據《裁判官條例》（第227章）第104條向有關裁判官申請覆核其判處的刑罰；",
            "（二）根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）第81A條向上訴法庭申請覆核刑罰。申請原因是基於該刑罰並非經法律認可、原則上錯誤、或明顯過重或明顯不足。",
            "此外，假若法庭裁定無罪時出現「有悖常情」的裁決（即其所達致的結論或事實裁斷是任何明理、妥為顧及考慮因素並向自己發出適當指示的法庭均不可能達致的），或基於法庭裁定無罪時出現錯誤法律觀點，律政司亦可以在合適的情況下作出跟進，包括：",
            "（一）在區域法院審理的案件，根據《區域法院條例》（第336章）第84條以案件呈述的方式向上訴法庭提出上訴；",
            "（二）在裁判法院審理的案件，根據《裁判官條例》（第227章）第105條以案件呈述的方式，向原訟法庭提出上訴。",
            "律政司去年根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81A條提出的刑罰覆核申請有十七宗。在去年經已裁決的十二宗申請中，有十一宗申請得直。就涉及公眾活動的案件而言，上訴法庭在其中四宗案件中，重申了黃之鋒案的判刑原則，即在處理牽涉暴力的大型非法集會案件時，必須強調阻嚇和懲罰作用。上訴法庭亦在其中三宗案件的判案書中，強調「在處理嚴重控罪的時候，即使犯案者年紀輕，法庭仍必須對懲罰，阻嚇及譴責的判刑因素給予適當比重」。判案書亦明確指出：「若基於公眾利益的考慮，因嚴重的罪行或犯罪情況而需要判處犯案者嚴厲或具阻嚇力的判刑，其年輕或個人背景的比重將會極其有限，甚至是微不足道，原因是嚴懲或阻嚇的需要遠超過犯案者更生的需要。」",
            "有部分傳媒卻忽視律政司在聆訊上提出的理據，甚至法庭在判決書中所陳述的理由，而選擇使用偏頗及不能客觀地反映事實的字句來作出報道。我絕不認同這種手法，更必須向大家強調律政司一直致力確保檢控工作執行妥當，檢控人員秉持最高的專業標準處理刑事案件，以同等的尺度，不偏不倚地秉行公義。",
