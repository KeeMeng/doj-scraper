            "Hong Kong has all along been a prime venue for providing international legal and dispute resolution services. However, a media organisation has reported that some international corporations consider “excluding Hong Kong from legal contracts”. In order to reassure the international community that Hong Kong is still nonpareil in terms of providing deal making and dispute resolution services, the Asian Academy of International Law (AAIL) organised a webinar on February 26, joined by legal practitioners and professionals, to showcase why Hong Kong is irreplaceable. With the use of technology, there were nearly 1,000 registrations from some 58 jurisdictions.",
            "Indeed, this is not the first time that there were speculations over Hong Kong’s status as a leading international legal hub. Back in 2019 when Hong Kong suffered from street violence, spreading anti-Chinese sentiments, some reports suggested that enterprises had concerns over the use of Hong Kong as a legal and dispute resolution hub. To come forth to understand the situation and embrace any challenge, a seminar entitled “Is Hong Kong Still Irreplaceable?” was organised by the Department of Justice (DoJ) in Beijing in November 2019 to facilitate communications between Hong Kong’s legal professionals and Mainland enterprises. Following frank exchanges, all the participants eventually reached a consensus that “Hong Kong is still irreplaceable”.",
            "At the AAIL’s webinar this year, speakers from international law firms and corporations led dialogues exploring the importance of Hong Kong’s role as a centre for deal-making and dispute resolution. The discussions revealed that Hong Kong’s success as an international legal hub is built on strong foundations, including a stable business environment, the free flow of capital, a low and simple tax system, and most importantly, a reliable legal system.",
            "I was delighted to have shared my thoughts with the audience across the globe at the webinar, reassuring them Hong Kong will continue to provide a business-friendly legal framework for the international business community. Our legal infrastructure consists of a well-tested common law system, an open, transparent and independent judiciary, and also a pool of legal talents. Hong Kong law is well-known for its predictability and certainty and has been chosen as the applicable law in many international commercial transactions.",
            "Hong Kong enjoys a number of exclusive advantages with its unique position under the “One Country, Two Systems”. The interim measures arrangement, signed between Hong Kong and the Mainland in 2019, is one of the many examples. This game-changing arrangement allows parties to arbitral proceedings, which are seated in Hong Kong and administered by one of the six arbitral institutions, to seek assistance from the relevant court in the Mainland to obtain interim measures. Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, for instance, has received applications to preserve assets totalling US$1.9 billion and Mainland courts have granted orders totalling US$1.5 billion. Hong Kong is the only jurisdiction outside the Mainland that can provide this service.",
            "Another feature unique to Hong Kong is the opportunities under the Belt and Road Initiative and in the Greater Bay Area (GBA). Take the GBA as an example. Hong Kong enterprises registered in Qianhai Shenzhen can now choose Hong Kong law as the applicable law for their contracts. Also, Hong Kong lawyers can take a special examination and be qualified as a Mainland legal practitioner in the GBA. This means businesses will be able to secure a lawyer in Hong Kong that is qualified to advise on both Hong Kong and Mainland laws in commercial and investment transactions within the GBA. Only Hong Kong lawyers can benefit from this special arrangement.",
            "Hong Kong has earned a global reputation for our exceptional legal and dispute resolution services over the years. Despite all the challenges ahead, experience sharing by the international practitioners in the webinar has provided facts and data for one to appreciate that Hong Kong will continue to thrive in financial and commercial activities, and, as talents always follow the money, a comprehensive range of world-class services would be available. Hong Kong will be an ideal place for people and businesses to connect and excel. In summary, Hong Kong is irreplaceable because of its financial and legal infrastructure, the business opportunities and the pool of talents.",

            "香港一直是提供國際法律及爭議解決服務的首選地。然而，有媒體提及某些國際企業考慮「將香港從法律合同中剔除」。為了向國際社會再次肯定香港仍然是提供促成交易及爭議解決服務的不二之選，亞洲國際法律研究院於二月二十六日舉辦了一場網上研討會，邀請了法律界及專業人士闡釋為何香港是不可被替代。透過善用科技，研討會吸引了來自大約58個司法管轄區近1000名人士登記參加。",
            "事實上，這已非首次有言論揣測香港作為國際法律樞紐的地位。在二○一九年，香港飽受街頭暴力陰霾籠罩、有人散播反中國的言論，亦有報道指企業對選擇香港作為法律及爭議解決樞紐表示憂慮。為了解情況和面對挑戰，律政司於當年十一月在北京舉辦了以「香港還是不可替代嗎？」為題的研討會，推動香港法律界與內地企業聯繫。經過真誠的交流，所有參與者均認同「香港還是不可替代」。",
            "在這次亞洲國際法律研究院的網上研討會上，來自國際律師事務所及機構的講者，探討了香港作為促成交易和爭議解決服務中心的重要性。討論展示香港得以成為國際法律樞紐，是建基於強大的根基，包括穩定的營商環境、資金自由流通、低稅率及簡單稅制，最重要的還有穩健的法律制度。",
            "我亦很榮幸能夠透過這個研討會與世界各地的與會者分享想法，講解香港會繼續向國際商界提供方便營商的法律框架。我們的法律基建包含了久經考驗的普通法制、公開、透明和獨立的司法機關，以及豐富的法律人才。香港的法律素來以可預測和穩定而聞名，在很多國際商業交易中被選用為適用法律。",
            "香港在「一國兩制」下擁有特別的地位，並且為香港帶來了獨特的優勢。香港與內地在二○一九年簽訂了保全措施安排，是其中一個例子。這項開創新格局的安排容許六間香港合資格申請保全措施的仲裁及爭議解決機構，可代表仲裁程序的當事人向內地法院申請保全。作為其中一間合資格的機構，香港國際仲裁中心向內地法院提出申請的仲裁案件爭議金額達19億美元，當中內地法庭已准出達15億美元的保全金額賠償。香港是第一個內地以外的司法管轄區能夠提供這種服務。",
            "另一個獨特之處是「一帶一路」及大灣區帶來的機遇。以大灣區為例，在深圳前海註冊的香港企業現在可以選擇香港法律作為其合同的適用法律。此外，香港律師可通過特設考試獲取內地執業資格，在大灣區提供法律服務。這意味著企業能夠聘請合資格的香港律師，就大灣區內的商業和投資交易向他們提供觸及香港和內地法律的意見。只有香港的律師才能從這項安排中受益。",
            "香港的法律和爭議解決服務享譽國際，儘管未來充滿挑戰，但國際法律專業人士在研討會上的經驗交流為我們提供了事實與數據，支持香港將在金融和商業活動中蓬勃發展，而人才總是緊隨資金流向，香港可繼續提供全面的卓越服務，並且是連繫全球人才與商貿的理想地點。總括而言，香港擁有完善的金融和法律架構、商機無限和優秀的專業人才，地位絕不可被取代。",
