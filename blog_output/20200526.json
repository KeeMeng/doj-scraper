            "Last weekend, the Hong Kong community again saw the social unrest in Causeway Bay and Wanchai carried out by some under the pretext of protest against the draft Decision on national security legislation (draft Decision) to be passed by the National People’s Congress (NPC). What’s even more worrying is that some wrongly claimed that the draft Decision tramples on “one country, two systems” and is in breach of the Basic Law.",
            "The first question that one should ask is whether the NPC and its Standing Committee (NPCSC) have the power and authority to introduce law and other legal instrument in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The answer is a clear “yes” because under Articles 57 and 58 of the Constitution of the PRC (PRC Constitution), the NPC is the highest organ of state power in the PRC, and the NPC and the NPCSC exercise the legislative power of the state to introduce laws and other legal instruments.",
            "It has also been made clear that the Decision is to be made pursuant to Article 31, 62(2), (14) and (16) of the PRC Constitution and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. Under Article 6 of the draft Decision, the NPC delegated the NPCSC the duty to make the national security law applicable to the HKSAR.",
            "The second question is whether such power and authority covers national security. Again, the answer is a clear “yes” because there is not any doubt that national security is a matter of national interest that concerns the whole population of the PRC and falls squarely within the purview of the Central Authorities. National security is never part of Hong Kong’s autonomy. As such, the national security legislation to be enacted by the NPCSC is obviously within the ambit of “defence and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the [HKSAR]” as under Article 18(3) of the Basic Law.",
            "The third question is on the relationship between Article 18(3) and Article 23 of the Basic Law. As a start, it is essential to understand that pursuant to Article 12 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong is a local administrative region of the PRC that comes directly under the Central People’s Government. Under Article 23 of the Basic Law, the HKSAR is authorised to enact laws to prohibit specific acts relating to national security. Given the purpose and context of Article 23 as well as the ordinary meaning of the terms used, such authorisation clearly does not preclude the Central Authorities from introducing a national security legislation.",
            "It is fundamental to recognise that the Central Authorities holds the ultimate responsibility for national security in all local administrative regions. It is trite that a delegation of power by the principal to the delegatee is not an abrogation or abdication of the responsibility and power of the principal. As such, any right minded person can conclude that the enactment of the national security law by the NPCSC and the addition of such law to Annex III of the Basic Law to be promulgated by the HKSAR is in compliance with Article 18(3) and is not in any way in conflict with Article 23 of the Basic Law.",
            "As can be seen from the above, the draft Decision and the passing by the NPCSC of the national laws is in compliance with the “one country, two systems” principle as encapsulated in the PRC Constitution and the Basic Law.",
            "Given that the details of the design of the national security legislation to be enacted by the NPCSC and introduced to Annex III of the Basic Law to be promulgated by the HKSAR are not yet known, now is not the time to make unwarranted speculations. Unfortunately, some have apparently and perhaps misguidedly tried to smear and vilify the draft Decision as well as the national security legislation to be enacted by the NPCSC as representing “the death of one country, two systems”. Such an assertion does not stand legal scrutiny. The legal process to be adopted by the NPC and NPCSC is enshrined in law, justified in logic and reasonable in the circumstances of the situation in the HKSAR.",
            "As clearly stated in the draft Decision and the Explanatory Statement of the draft Decision, when making the Decision, the NPC will comply with the laws, the “one country, two systems” principle and also endeavour to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of people in Hong Kong. Indeed, the very fact that the draft Decision on the national security legislation to be submitted to the NPC is in compliance with the Basic Law. The Central Authorities and the HKSAR are conducting our internal affairs of our own state in accordance with our Constitution and the Basic Law, and importantly in full accord with the “one country, two systems” principle.",

            "剛過去的週末，大家在銅鑼灣及灣仔一帶又再次目睹充斥著暴力破壞，有些人利用全國人民代表大會（全國人大）將審議建立健全香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的決定（草案）（《決定》）作為藉口進行示威。更令人憂慮的是，有人故意錯誤地聲稱《決定》踐踏了“一國兩制”和違反《基本法》。",
            "或許大家會先問，全國人大及全國人大常務委員會（全國人大常委會）在中華人民共和國內是否有權力制定法律及其他法律文書？答案非常簡單：“有”。根據中華人民共和國憲法（《憲法》）第五十七條和五十八條，全國人大是中華人民共和國最高的國家權力機關，全國人大和全國人大常委會行使國家立法權制定法律和其他法律文書。",
            "大家都清楚知道《決定》是根據《憲法》第三十一條、第六十二條（二）、（十四）和（十六）以及《基本法》相關條文作出。根據《決定》第六條，全國人大授權全國人大常委會制定適用於香港特別行政區的維護國家安全法律。",
            "第二個問題是有關權力是否涵蓋國家安全？答案同樣十分清晰：“是”。國家安全關乎到全國人民及國家的整體利益，全屬中央事權，從來不屬於香港特別行政區的自治範圍之內，這一點是毋庸置疑的。因此，全國人大常委會制定國家安全法律是符合《基本法》第十八條（三）“國防、外交和其他按《基本法》規定不屬於香港特別行政區自治範圍的法律。”",
            "第三個問題是《基本法》第十八條（三）與第二十三條的關係。首先，大家必須理解《基本法》第十二條指出香港特別行政區是中華人民共和國的一個享有高度自治權的地方行政區域，直轄於中央人民政府；而《基本法》第二十三條則說明香港特別行政區應自行立法禁止與國家安全有關的指定行為。就第二十三條的目的以及條款的普通解釋而言，獲授權並不會排除中央為維護國家安全而進行立法。",
            "中央對所有地方行政區域的國家安全負有最終的責任，大家都必須要認清這個基礎。當授權者對獲授權者作出授權後，並不代表授權者放棄或減少任何責任和權力。因此，全國人大常委會就國安法制定為全國性法律，列入《基本法》附件三，並由香港特別行政區公布，做法符合《基本法》第十八條（三）並且與第二十三條沒有衝突，這是任何一個常人都會得到的結論。",
            "基於上述的理由，《決定》及全國人大常委會通過全國性法律是依據《憲法》和《基本法》來貫徹“一國兩制”方針。",
            "即將由全國人大常委會制定、並列入《基本法》附件三以及由香港特別行政區公布的國家安全法，細節現時尚未公布，因此並不適合作出任何無謂的揣測。但不幸地，有些說法無理批評《決定》，並將訂立港區國安法說成等同“破壞一國兩制”，這種主張在法律層面上站不住腳。全國人大和全國人大常委會採用的程序合乎法律要求，有根有據，並切合香港特別行政區現時的情況。",
            "《決定》及相關《說明》已清晰指出，全國人大會根據法律和“一國兩制”方針作出決定，並切實保障香港居民的合法權益。將《決定》提交全國人大是符合《基本法》的原則，中央和香港特別行政區是依據《憲法》和《基本法》貫徹落實“一國兩制”，來處理我們的國家內部事務。",
