            "The Financial Secretary just delivered the latest Budget on Wednesday. The Department of Justice would foster the policy initiatives relating to “Diversified Economy” and continue our on-going works. The Inclusive Dispute Avoidance and Resolution Office (IDAR Office, email: idar@doj.gov.hk), which was set up in January last year, is to better coordinate and implement initiatives in the areas of dispute avoidance and resolution, thereby further consolidating our position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia Pacific region.",
            "The Department of Justice has always been actively striving for the presence of international dispute resolution bodies in Hong Kong in order to meet the upsurge in demand for legal and dispute resolution services arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and the Greater Bay Area Plan. Their presence in Hong Kong would also enhance our status as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services. With the support of the Central People’s Government, we are now exploring the possibility for the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO) to establish a regional centre for international commercial arbitration in Hong Kong.",
            "Last year, the inter-sessional meetings of the Judgments Project of the Hague Conference on Private International Law were successfully concluded in Hong Kong. This invaluable experience has reinforced our determination in looking for decision-making meetings of international and intergovernmental organisations to be held in Hong Kong, including hosting the 59th Annual Session of AALCO and an intersessional meeting of UNCITRAL’s Working Group III this year. High ranking government officials and legal experts from member states would take part in these meetings to discuss matters such as maritime law and cyber space law.",
            "In addition, we are committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a regional capacity building centre which seeks to enhance legal infrastructure in the neighbouring regions and facilitate cross-border mobility and business activities. For instance, the Department of Justice organised the Investment Law and Investor-State Mediator Training Course for two consecutive years since 2018. World-renowned trainers were invited to share with the participants their experience in international investment law and investor-state mediation. We would be stepping up our efforts in organising capacity building courses in dispute resolution.",
            "At the same time, the Department of Justice has reached an agreement with the Hague Academy of International Law, one of the world’s leading academic institutes on international law, to support them in organising law courses in Hong Kong regularly in collaboration with the Asian Academy of International Law from this year. We anticipate this cooperation would provide Hong Kong and the neighbouring regions with high quality training for legal professionals, which helps further raise our international profile.",
            "Looking ahead, colleagues in the Department of Justice would keep pursuing cooperation or partnership agreements with other jurisdictions and international organisations and host important events in Hong Kong, with a view to raising the international profile of Hong Kong in deal-making and dispute resolution through overseas capacity building and promotional activities.",

            "財政司司長在周三公布了新一份的財政預算案，律政司會積極推動與\"多元經濟\"相關的新措施和持續進行的工作。律政司去年一月成立的普惠避免及解決爭議辦公室(普惠辦公室，電郵idar@doj.gov.hk)，目的是加強統籌和實施我們在避免及解決爭議範疇中的措施，進一步鞏固香港作為亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。",
            "律政司一直積極爭取國際爭議解決機構在香港落戶，以應對因為“一帶一路”和大灣區發展而不斷增加的法律及爭議解決服務需求，除此以外，國際機構在香港設立辦公室，亦有助提升香港在國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。我們現時在中央政府的支持下，正在探討亞洲－非洲法律協商組織（亞非法協）在香港設立區域國際商業仲裁中心的可行性。",
            "去年，我們成功主辦海牙國際私法會議判決項目間會，得到了寶貴的經驗，我們現正積極爭取香港繼續主辦國際及政府間組織的決策會議，包括在今年主辦第59屆亞非法協年會及聯合國國際貿易法委員會第三工作組的間會。成員國會派出高級官員和法律專家出席，討論一些重要國際法議題，例如海事法和網絡空間法等。",
            "此外，我們致力提升香港作為區內能力建設中心的地位，促進周邊地區的法律基建，以利便跨境流動和商業活動。我們在2018年及2019年，連續兩年舉辦了投資法暨國際投資爭端調解技巧的培訓課程，邀請了世界知名的導師向參加者分享國際投資法和投資者與國家間調解方面的知識和經驗。律政司會繼續加強舉辦爭議解決能力建設的課程。",
            "與此同時，律政司亦已經與其中一所全球頂尖國際法學術機構的海牙國際法學院達成協議，支持其與亞洲國際法律研究院合作，由今年開始在香港定期舉辦法律課程。我們期望這項合作能為本港及周邊地區的法律人士提供優質的培訓和進一步提升香港的國際形象。",
            "展望未來工作，律政司的同事，會繼續積極推展新的政策措施，與其他司法管轄區和國際組織磋商和訂立合作或伙伴安排，在香港舉行重要國際盛事和活動，並會致力透過海外的能力建設和推廣活動提升香港在促成交易和解決爭議方面的國際形象。",
