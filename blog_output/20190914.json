            "I mentioned in my blog earlier that I encouraged a group of law students to visit more places to exchange with local legal sector to broaden their horizons.",
            "With the support of the Central Government, Hainan has been working on building a free trade port. Last month, the Department of Justice and our counterparts in Hainan successfully arranged the Hainan International Arbitration Court, HK45 and the International Youth Legal Exchange Federation for organising a symposium on the opening up and the rule of law of Hainan. A group of young lawyers from Hong Kong was invited.",
            "On their return from Hainan, these young lawyers told me that they learnt the latest development of Hainan at the symposium where they also shared their experience in legal and dispute resolution service. The next day, the group attended a talk by the President of National Institute for South China Seas Studies, Dr Wu Shicun, on the prevailing challenges.",
            "Last Saturday, I signed a framework arrangement with the President of the High People's Court of Guangdong Province, Mr Gong Jiali, on the exchange and mutual learning in legal aspects between Hong Kong and Guangdong in Shenzhen which will provide a platform for future exchange and mutual learning.",
            "A two-day seminar was then jointly organised by the Department of Justice, the High People's Court of Guangdong Province and the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court under the above arrangement at the weekend. On Sunday, some 30 members of legal sector from Hong Kong joined the programme with Mainland lawyers and judges to study the contract law between the Mainland and Hong Kong. The speakers explained the difference between common law and civil law in the interpretation of contractual arrangements. This enhanced the mutual understanding of the two legal systems with each other.",
            "The Inclusive Dispute Avoidance and Resolution Office, working directly under my steer, was established in January with an aim to enhance our capacity building to raise the international profile of Hong Kong in deal making and dispute resolution. I look forward to creating more opportunities on exchanges for legal practitioners between Hong Kong and other jurisdictions, thereby facilitating the export of our legal services and also conveying our strength of the rule of law.",

            "我早前在網誌中提到與一班法律學生見面時，鼓勵他們多點與不同地方的法律界接觸，增廣見聞。",
            "在中央政府支持下，海南積極建設為自由貿易港，海南省司法廳與律政司成功安排了海南國際仲裁院與HK45及國際青年法律交流聯會在八月底合辦了一場座談會－“海南自貿區（港）座談會－開放與法治”，邀請了香港一班年輕的律師參加。",
            "他們回來後都跟我說在這個行程中獲益不少，除了知道更多海南的最新發展外，還有機會在座談會中分享關於香港的法律及爭議解決服務的經驗。他們在翌日更獲安排參觀中國南海研究院，聽取吳士存院長講解當前南海的形勢。",
            "另外，我上周六在深圳與廣東省高級人民法院院長龔稼立簽署了《廣東省高級人民法院與香港特別行政區政府律政司就大灣區法律交流與互鑑的框架安排》，為日後雙方的交流與互鑑提供平台。",
            "在《框架安排》下，香港與廣東省高級人民法院及深圳市中級人民法院在上周末已一連兩天合辦講座。周日有三十多位香港的法律界人士及內地的律師和法官一同出席講座，就內地與香港合同法作出比較，講者分析了普通法與大陸法對合同解釋的差異，讓雙方更加了解對方的法制。",
            "我年初設立“普惠避免及解決爭議辦公室”的其中一個主要目的，就是希望提升我們法律界的能力建設，鞏固香港在促成交易和爭議解決方面的地位。我亦希望製造多些機會，讓香港的法律業界與其他司法管轄區的人士交流，推展香港的法律服務之餘，也向外宣傳香港的法治優勢。",
