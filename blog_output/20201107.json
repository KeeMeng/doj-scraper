            "The opening of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2020 in conjunction with the launch of the Hong Kong Legal Hub and the \"Vision 2030 for Rule of Law\" (\"Vision 2030\") on November 2 signified an important milestone in our work on enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international legal hub for legal, deal-making and dispute resolution services, as well as consolidating the foundation of our rule of law.",
            "The Hong Kong Legal Hub, comprising the former French Mission Building (FMB), certain space in the West Wing of former Central Government Offices (CGO) and part of Two Exchange Square, houses a number of renowned law-related organisations (LROs). The FMB is the centre for international law where offices of local, regional and international bodies are set up, facilitating easy and effective exchanges. Two Exchange Square, a linkage between the core of our city and the international airport, is a prime location for international dispute resolution institutions. Meanwhile, the backbone and very important part of the local and regional LROs are located in the West Wing of former CGO. Together with the Department of Justice offices in the Main Wing, the East Wing and part of West Wing of the former CGO, the whole area forms an international legal hub at the heart of Hong Kong.",
            "The Inaugural Rule of Law Congress was one of the flagship programmes of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2020. Distinguished speakers shared their views on enhancing existing legal aid systems in pursuing access to justice for all. They also shared experience and addressed the need for ongoing capacity building to strengthen and enhance judges’ ability in discharging their judicial functions, for example, better use of technologies in court, in light of the difficulties brought by the pandemic.",
            "Amid all the challenges in light of COVID-19, we were delighted to learn that the Sports Dispute Resolution Conference and the Mediate Conference were both well-received despite they were held online. In fact, this arrangement allowed us to reach out to more audience in Hong Kong and other parts of the world, free from limitations on the physical space or geographical location.",
            "During this week, we are have been able to gather information on how to explore further in setting up a dedicated scheme for sports dispute resolution in light of the conference on the subject.",
            "The annual Hong Kong Mediation Lecture focused on investment mediation, a subject that the DoJ has been promoting. Next Monday, we will hold another hybrid online event with UNCITRAL and Asian Academy of International Law: UNCITRAL Working Group III Virtual Pre-Intersessional Meeting on the Use of Mediation in ISDS. If you have registered, you can watch the conference anywhere around the world with only an internet connection.",
            "I hope that the Hong Kong Legal Week 2020 would not only keep us abreast of the latest legal developments, but also provided us with a platform to explore collaboration. You are most welcome to review all the programmes at the dedicated webpage: https://www.legalweek.hk.",
            "The pandemic has highlighted the importance of technology and the numerous benefits that it could bring. In order to keep pace with global changes, the DoJ would continue to make the best use of technology to enhance the efficiency of our work.",
            "At the same time, we would spare no effort in promoting LawTech in the legal, deal-making and dispute resolution sector. We are determined to capitalise on the opportunities brought by the development of our country, actively participate in the 14th Five-year Plan by building Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology hub, establishing a functional platform for the Belt and Road Initiative as well as taking part in the planning of the Greater Bay Area with a view to integrating into the overall development of our country.",

            "今年的香港法律周與香港法律樞紐開幕禮及「願景2030—聚焦法治」啟動儀式在十一月二日同時舉行，標誌著律政司在提升香港作為法律、促成交易及爭議解決服務的國際法律樞紐的一個里程碑，並鞏固了我們的法治基礎。",
            "香港法律樞紐由前法國外方傳道會大樓、前中區政府合署西座及交易廣場二期部分地方組成，提供予知名的法律相關組織使用。國際、區域及本地組織在前法國外方傳道會大樓設立辦公室，方便就國際法律進行交流；交易廣場二期連接市中心及香港國際機場，為國際爭議解決機構提供了一個優越的地點；而前中區政府合署西座則集合了一些本地及區域重要的骨幹法律相關組織。連同律政司位於前中區政府合署中座、東座和部分西座的辦公室，這個地域組成了位於香港市中心的一個國際法律樞紐。",
            "首屆法治大會是香港法律周2020的其中一個旗艦項目，講者分享了他們對完善現有法律援助系統的看法，以確保所有人都有平等訴諸司法的機會；同時，他們分享經驗和講解持續進行能力建設的必要性，以增強司法人員履行職能的能力，例如法庭可善用科技，應對疫情帶來的挑戰。",
            "儘管香港仍然受疫情影響，令到香港法律周的體育爭議解決會議及調解會議必須改為網上舉行，但我們很高興獲悉反應十分踴躍。同時，因為不再受場地或地域所規限，網上舉行讓我們接觸到更多身處香港以至世界各地的群眾。",
            "透過在這個星期內舉辦的會議，我們了解到該如何進一步探索建立專門的體育糾紛解決方案。",
            "至於每年都舉辦的調解講座，今年的主題是投資爭端調解，亦是律政司一直推廣的政策。我們在下星期一將會與聯合國國際貿易法委員會及亞洲國際法律研究院合辦聯合國國際貿易法委員會第三工作組關於「調解在投資者與東道國間爭議解決機制中的應用」的間會預備研討會，會議也是透過網上進行，如果你已經登記，你身處全球任何角落也只需連接互聯網便可以觀看。",
            "我希望香港法律周2020的活動，不單帶給大家最新的法律資訊，更為大家構建一個探索合作機會的平台。如果大家有興趣重溫這星期豐富的節目，歡迎瀏覽香港法律周的專頁（https://www.legalweek.hk）。",
            "疫情的出現突顯了科技的重要性及優異之處，為配合全球趨勢，律政司會繼續善用科技進一步提升我們的工作效率。",
            "同時，律政司亦會致力在法律、促成交易及爭議解決服務方面推動法律科技，把握國家發展的機遇，積極參與國家「十四五」規劃，建設國際創新科技中心，打造「一帶一路」功能平台，投身大灣區建設，以融入國家發展的大局為目標。",
