            "A new Anti-sanction Law was passed by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on June 10. It is an opportune time for me to share with you some thoughts on this topic.",
            "Sovereign equality and the principle of non-intervention",
            "From the international law perspective, sovereign equality is a basic norm of international relations and a fundamental principle of international law, with the Charter of the United Nations (UN) expressly setting out this principle1, adding that nothing contained in the Charter shall authorise the UN to “intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state2”.",
            "The principle of non-intervention is an important concept central to sovereign equality. The United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted in 1970 the “Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations” (“Friendly Relations Declaration”), which declares, among others, that “[n]o State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law”. The International Court of Justice in its judgment3 in 1986 reaffirmed non-intervention as a principle of customary international law.",
            "Sanctions by the UN",
            "Under international law, sanctions should be brought only in very limited circumstances which constitute a threat to international peace and security, such as dealing with terrorism or nuclear proliferation, etc., and in an appropriate forum, which is the UN Security Council. When instructed by the Central People’s Government to implement any UN sanctions, the HKSAR Government would make regulations under the United Nations Sanctions Ordinance (Cap. 537) to give effect to the relevant instruction. This mechanism has been in place for years and by which we have implemented a number of UN sanctions in the HKSAR.",
            "Unilateral coercive measures",
            "Other so-called “sanctions” without the authorisation of the UN Security Council, better described as unilateral coercive measures, are contrary to international law and the UN framework, and most importantly violate the principle of non-intervention under international law.",
            "We can see examples where States unilaterally impose coercive measures on other States or individuals with a view to exerting coercion or achieving implicit subjugation. Evidently, these are done with a political motive in mind, intending to suppress the actions of the effected State or individual, and trying to interfere with the internal affairs or exercise of sovereign power of the State. For example, following the enactment of the National Security Law, a number of foreign countries imposed unilateral coercive measures on government officials of the PRC and the HKSAR, suspending surrender of fugitive offenders agreements, and revoking Hong Kong’s special trading status as a separate customs territory and relabeling of exports from Hong Kong.",
            "Measures that have not been taken with authorisation of the United Nations Security Council are “unilateral coercive measures”, breaching the international law principles of sovereign equality and non-intervention, and a major barrier to international peace and stability.",
            "Countermeasures taken in response to unilateral coercive measures",
            "Unilateral coercive measures are without a doubt at odds with the principle of non-intervention, unbecoming of any civilised nation, and a hindrance to international peace and stability. In the face of international illegal acts, a State is justified in deploying any countermeasures as a response to a breach of the principle of non-intervention against itself. Such countermeasures are an accepted practice under international law, and the rules on their use have been formulated under international instruments, notably the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC’s Draft Articles) adopted by the International Law Commission in 2001.",
            "In accordance with the ILC’s Draft Articles, a State that is subjected to unilateral coercive measures would be entitled to impose countermeasures as set out under Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles. The ILC’s Draft Articles further provide in Chapter II of Part Three for, inter alia, the requirements of refraining from the threat or use of force, and any countermeasures being proportionate.",
            "Anti-sanction Law is an accepted and legitimate practice under international law",
            "In the Explanatory Note on the Draft Anti-sanction Law, the three necessities for legislating the Law are clearly set out. China is entitled to impose countermeasures in response to unilateral coercive measures taken by foreign States and the Law provides the legal framework for the countermeasures to be implemented. It states unequivocally that it has to be applied within the whole of China. As it is a national law, and as the imposition of countermeasures is entirely a matter of foreign affairs, the most natural and appropriate way for it to be introduced to the HKSAR would be to add it to Annex III to the Basic Law in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Law. This of course is a matter for the NPCSC to decide after consultation with the Basic Law Committee and the HKSAR Government.",
            "The Anti-sanction Law of the PRC was enacted as a countermeasure in the face of unilateral coercive measures which are prohibited under international law. Not only is the enactment of this Law legitimate, reasonable and fair, it is also in conformity with the requirements relating to countermeasures as set out in the ILC’s Draft Articles highlighted above.",
            "Concerns have been expressed about the impact of the Anti-sanction Law introduced by China. Yet, the more appropriate questions to be asked are first, why does a foreign State interfere with China’s exercise of its sovereign rights to legislate national security laws, and secondly, why should a State or group of States be allowed to impose unilateral coercive measures against other States and legislate “long-arm” statutes purporting to enforce such internationally wrongful acts without consequences. It is these foreign States that impose unilateral coercive measures that should be condemned and it is they that the international community should be concerned about. At this point, one cannot help but recall the treacherous and despicable acts by certain anti-China disruptors who relentlessly and shamefully seek foreign States to impose sanctions against China including Hong Kong. No one who loves China and Hong Kong would embark upon such abominable and contemptible acts.",
            "As can be seen in the Explanatory Note, the Law will provide a legal basis by which the countermeasures are to be implemented and enforced. It will supplement the legal tool box countering unilateral coercive measures, interference and long-arm jurisdiction of foreign States with a view to resolutely safeguarding national sovereignty, dignity and core interests of our motherland.",
            "August 8, 2021",
            "1 See Article 2(1) of Chapter 1 of the United Nations Charter.",
            "2 See Article 2(7) of Chapter 1 of the United Nations Charter.",
            "3 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua. The judgment of the International Court of Justice acknowledged that the principle of non-intervention “forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in internal or external affairs of other States”(see para. 205 of the judgment of the International Court of Justice)."

            "全國人民代表大會常務委員會（全國人大常委會）在六月十日通過新的《反外國制裁法》。我藉此分享一些想法。",
            "主權平等及不干涉原則",
            "在國際法的層面而言，主權平等是國際關係的基本慣例，也是國際法的基本原則。《聯合國憲章》清楚訂明有關原則1，並指出憲章並沒授權聯合國「干涉屬任何國家國內管轄的事件2」。",
            "不干涉原則是主權平等的核心概念。聯合國大會於1970年一致通過的《關於各國依聯合國憲章建立友好關係及合作之國際法原則之宣言》，當中包括「任何國家或國家集團均無權以任何理由直接或間接干涉任何其他國家之內政或外交事務。因此，武裝干涉及對國家人格或其政治、經濟及文化要素之一切其他形式之干預或試圖威脅，均係違反國際法。」國際法院在1986年的判決3亦再次肯定不干涉原則是國際習慣法的一部分。",
            "聯合國的制裁",
            "在國際法下，制裁只適用於極為有限的威脅國際和平與安全的情況，例如針對恐怖主義或核武擴散等問題，並且透過適當的平台——即聯合國安全理事會（安理會）實施。香港特區政府在按照中央人民政府指示實施聯合國的制裁措施時，會根據《聯合國制裁條例》（香港法例第537章）訂立規例執行有關指示。這個機制已運作多年，並已透過此機制在香港特區實施多項聯合國的制裁措施。",
            "單邊強制措施",
            "其他沒有得到聯合國安理會授權的所謂「制裁」，應更恰當地稱為「單邊強制措施」，不但與國際法和聯合國的框架相違背，最重要的是違反了國際法規定的不干涉原則。",
            "我們可以看到有一些國家單方面將這些脅迫措施強加於其他國家或個人身上，作為威脅或企圖以無形之手作出干涉。這些行徑顯然具有政治目的，透過壓制受影響國家或個人，試圖干涉該國家的內政和主權。例如，在制定《香港國安法》後，一些西方國家對中國和香港特別行政區的政府官員實施單邊強制措施、暫停移交逃犯協定、撤銷香港特別行政區作為單獨關稅區的獨特貿易地位，以及重新標籤香港出口的產品。",
            "所有未獲聯合國安理會授權實施的措施均為「單邊強制措施」，有違國際法主權平等和不干涉原則，構成國際和平與穩定的重要障礙。",
            "回應單邊強制措施的反制措施",
            "單邊強制措施毫無疑問違反了不干涉原則，亦不是文明國家應有的所為，有礙國際和平與穩定。面對國際違法行為，各國有理由採取反制措施，以回應違反不干涉原則的行徑。這類反制措施為國際法所接受，而採取反制措施的相關條件已被編纂並載於國際文書，尤其包括國際法委員會在2001年通過的《國家對國際不法行為的責任條款草案》（《條款草案》）。",
            "根據國際法委員會的《條款草案》，遭受單邊強制措施的國家，有權按《條款草案》第二十二條採取反制措施。《條款草案》並在第三部分的第二章進一步訂明避免威脅或使用武力以及相稱性等的要求。",
            "《反外國制裁法》合法並為國際法所接受",
            "關於《中華人民共和國反外國制裁法(草案)》的說明清楚列出訂立《反外國制裁法》的三個迫切需要。中國有權採取反制措施，應對外國施加的單邊強制措施。《反外國制裁法》為實行反制措施提供法律框架，並清楚列明全國境內應當執行。《反外國制裁法》是全國性法律，而且採取反制措施完全屬於外交事務，依《基本法》第十八條將之列入附件三在香港特別行政區實施，是最自然也最恰當的方法。有關決定當然最終應由全國人大常委會在徵詢基本法委員會和香港特區政府後作出。",
            "中國訂立《反外國制裁法》是為了反制國際法下所禁止的單邊強制措施。《反外國制裁法》的制訂不單合法、合理和公平，而且符合上述國際法委員會的《條款草案》就反制措施所列出的要求。",
            "有人就中國制訂《反外國制裁法》造成的影響表示關注。然而，我們更應該問的是，第一，別國為何干預中國行使國家主權訂立國家安全法；第二，為何個別國家或一些國家可以聯手向其他國家實施單邊強制措施，並訂立「長臂法」企圖執行一些國際法不容許的行為而無需承擔後果。這些實施單邊強制措施的國家，才應該遭譴責、受國際社會關注。說到這裏，不禁想起一些反中亂港份子曾不斷無恥地乞求外國制裁中國包括香港，行為令人不齒，愛國愛港的人絕不會作出此等卑鄙劣行。",
            "正如《反外國制裁法(草案)》的說明所指出，《反外國制裁法》將為實施和執行反制措施提供法律基礎，充實作為反擊外國單邊脅迫、干涉和長臂管轄權的法律「工具箱」，體現維護國家主權、尊嚴和核心利益的堅定意志。",
            "2021年8月8日",
            "1 《聯合國憲章》第一章第二條第一款。",
            "2 《聯合國憲章》第一章第二條第七款。",
            "3 尼加拉瓜境內和針對尼加拉瓜的軍事和準軍事行動案（尼加拉瓜 訴 美利堅合眾國）的國際法院判辭指出「禁止所有國家或國家集團直接或間接干涉別國之內政或外交事務」（見國際法院判辭第205段）。"
