            "As the flagship event of the Asian Academy of International Law, the Colloquium on International Law is organised in Hong Kong annually to deliberate on topical issues that pertain to different spheres of international law. The event, held on August 15 and 16 this year, was well attended by participants coming from all over the world with the presence of an array of distinguished speakers.",
            "Every year, the Colloquium attracts a good number of audience from different backgrounds and there was no exception this year. About 40 delegates from 30 countries, who joined the Training Session of China-AALCO Exchange and Research Programme on International Law, attended the Colloquium. Some of them are government lawyers and some are diplomats. The training programme was conducted both in Beijing and Hong Kong.",
            "In Hong Kong, they were given an opportunity to feel for themselves the full and successful implementation of “one country, two systems”, and to gain a better understanding of the importance of the rule of law. Exchange sessions were arranged where experts shared experience of international law in practice. At the same time, the delegates were able to understand Hong Kong’s legal system and thereby encouraged to use our legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "This year’s Colloquium focused on the uncertainties brought by the current trade dispute and political issues in the international arena. The speakers analysed the underlying causes and examined the foundation of hope for the future, offering insights to the audience.",
            "Addressing the Colloquium, the Chief Executive pointed out that Hong Kong embraces an independent and impartial judicial system with a broad pool of legal talent. She encouraged the sector to grasp the opportunities under the Greater Bay Area Plan and Belt and Road Initiative by further promoting Hong Kong’s legal services.",
            "In my speech, I mentioned that the arrangement on interim measures in aid of arbitral proceedings could prevent the other party from destroying the evidence or dissipating their assets so as to ensure that arbitral proceedings could be carried out effectively. I also highlighted that a mediation mechanism for resolving disputes under the CEPA Investment Agreement has already been put in place. We would capitalise on Hong Kong's strengths in mediation to better serve the local and international communities.",
            "At the Colloquium, I suggested that it was worth exploring the establishment of a body through collaboration, based on credibility and sensitive to cultural diversity, to provide innovative and diversified dispute resolution services that lead to a win-win situation for all parties and achieve the effect of synergy.",
            "Similarly, we should consider the use of an innovative and diversified dispute resolution technique to handle the existing conflicts in Hong Kong. Whilst enjoying the rights and freedoms that one is entitled to, one must also respect the rights of others. Consensus should be built through dialogues, not violence. We can then surpass this difficult time and restore peace and order in Hong Kong and move forward.",

            "亞洲國際法律研究院每年都會舉辦國際法論壇，共同商議國際法之下不同領域的熱點議題，而講者都是一些舉足輕重的人物，今年八月十五及十六日舉行的論壇吸引了來自世界各地的人士參加。",
            "每年國際法論壇都會有很多不同背景的嘉賓出席，今年也不例外，包括有約四十名正參加“中國—亞非法協國際法交流與研究項目”培訓班的學員，他們來自三十多個國家，當中有法務和外交人員，分別在北京和香港進行培訓。",
            "學員來香港可以親身體驗“一國兩制”得到全面和成功落實，並明白法治的重要。培訓班還安排了專家跟他們分享國際法實踐的經驗，同時亦讓他們了解香港的法律制度，從而鼓勵他們選用我們的法律及爭議解決服務。",
            "今年國際法論壇的焦點，是針對現時國際形勢前景不明，各國有機會受到貿易爭端及政治問題影響，講者探討了這種混亂形勢的根本原因以及未來希望的基礎，參加者可藉著多角度的討論從而獲得啟發。",
            "行政長官在論壇的開幕致辭指出，香港擁有獨立和公正的司法制度，同時亦有很多法律人才，我們應該要把握大灣區規劃和“一帶一路”倡議帶來的機遇，積極推廣香港的法律服務。",
            "我在論壇提到今年律政司與內地簽署的仲裁程序保全安排，這可以防止仲裁程序另一方故意毀滅證據或轉移財產，讓仲裁程序能有效地進行。此外，我也談到在CEPA下的投資協議，調解為解決爭議的途徑，而相關投資爭端調解機制亦已經實施。我們會善用在調解方面的優勢，加強服務本地和國際社會。",
            "我亦建議在“一帶一路”倡議下，設立一個透過各方協作、具公信力和尊重文化多樣性的機構，來處理爭端解決，以創新和多元化的解決爭議機制務求為各方帶來雙贏的局面，達致協同效應。",
            "同樣地，我們也可以考慮用創新和多元化的解決爭議的概念來處理香港目前的問題，大家享有言論及表達自由之餘，亦必需尊重其他不同意見，透過對話而不是暴力來尋求共識，這樣我們才能讓香港走出現時艱難的時刻，令社會回復安寧，創造機會讓我們一起帶領香港向前邁進。",
