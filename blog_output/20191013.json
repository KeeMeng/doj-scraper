            "The Chief Executive in Council decided to invoke the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and make a new regulation of Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation to effectively reduce act of violence and facilitate police investigation and administration of justice. We hope that it would help restore law and order and public peace in the society.",
            "Prohibiting persons from using face covering would facilitate police investigation and administration of justice and would as well deter them from acting in an unlawful manner on the basis that they may act with impunity by concealing their identity. The new regulation only prohibits people from using any face covering to prevent identification at unlawful assemblies, unauthorised assemblies, public meetings or public processions in respect of which a letter of no objection has been issued. Police officers are also empowered to require a person to remove facial covering in a public place to verify his identity.",
            "In devising the new regulation, the Government has given due consideration to the human rights guarantees in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, including the rights on the freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and privacy. However, these rights are not absolute, and may be subject to restrictions that satisfy the proportionality test including whether a reasonable balance has been struck between the societal benefits of the encroachment and the inroads made into the constitutionally protected rights of the individual.",
            "This measure would not deprive the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as people are still free to participate in lawful and peaceful public order events without face covering. If a member of the public in a public place is asked by police officers to remove the face covering to verify his identity, he may wear it again after the verification process is completed. Interference with a person’s rights is minimal, and in any event proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public safety and public order.",
            "Other than the specified circumstances set out in the new regulation, people are generally free to wear face masks and the impact on their daily lives is limited.",
            "The new regulation, which is a piece of subsidiary legislation, is made pursuant to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and has to be laid on the table of the Legislative Council which may by resolution amend the regulation. Hence, there is no issue of the Legislative Council being circumvented.",
            "The protests and confrontations have continued for almost four months. We hope that the new measure could help curb the spread of violence and restore social order. We also urge the understanding and support of the public in our work.",

            "行政長官會同行政會議決定引用《緊急情況規例條例》定立《禁止蒙面規例》，主要目的是希望透過新規例有效減少暴力行為並協助警方調查和執法，盡快令社會恢復治安和安寧。",
            "禁止在遊行集會時蒙面，有助警方的調查和執法，阻止暴力人士在掩飾身分的情況下犯罪並逍遙法外。新規例只是禁止身處非法集結、未經批准集結、或獲發不反對通知書的公眾集會或公眾遊行的人士使用蒙面物品阻止識別身分。新規例亦授權警務人員在公眾地方要求市民移除口罩或蒙面物品以核實身分。",
            "政府在制訂新規例時，已充份顧及《基本法》及《香港人權法案條例》內的人權保障，包括言論自由、和平集會和私生活的權利。但這些權利並非絕對，而是可以施加限制，不過有關限制需符合相稱性的原則，包括是否已在措施所帶來的社會利益及對個人權利的限制之間取得合理平衡。",
            "這項規例不會損害市民言論自由與和平集會自由，因為他們仍然可以在不蒙面的情況下，自由參加合法、和平的公眾活動。而市民在公眾地方被警務人員要求移除口罩或蒙面物品以核實身分，只要核實完成後，是可以立即戴回口罩或蒙面物品，所以新措施對市民權利的干擾是極為有限，而且與保障公共安全和公共秩序的合法目的相稱。",
            "除了在規例訂明的情況下不可以使用蒙面物品外，市民在其他情況下一般仍然可以戴上口罩，日常生活所受的影響不大。",
            "對於外界有意見指政府的做法是繞過立法會而進行立法，這並不正確，因為規例是根據《緊急情況規例條例》所制定，是一項附屬法例，會按規定提交予立法會省覽，包括通過決議提出修訂規例。",
            "經過了四個月的持續示威和衝突，我們希望這項措施能夠幫助阻止暴力蔓延，讓香港盡快回復正常，亦希望大家能夠理解並支持政府的工作。",
