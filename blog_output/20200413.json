            "In view of the severe economic repercussions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic globally and locally, the Government announced another package of measures to support the affected individuals and businesses last Wednesday. Two of which are particularly relevant to the legal and dispute resolution sector – LawTech Fund and COVID-19 Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Scheme. The LawTech Fund was briefly introduced in this blog a few days ago (https://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/blog/20200411_blog1.html). Today, I would like to give an outline of the COVID-19 ODR.",
            "In anticipation of an upsurge of disputes arising from or relating to COVID-19, the Scheme aims to provide speedy and cost-effective means to resolve such disputes, especially for those involving micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) that may be adversely affected or hard hit by the pandemic. The Scheme will engage eBRAM to provide ODR services to the general public and businesses, in particular MSMEs, involved in low value disputes.",
            "The Scheme plans to cover COVID-19 related disputes with the claim amount for each case to be capped at $500,000. Either one of the parties (claimant or respondent) must be a Hong Kong resident or company and they will only be required to each pay $200 as registration fees. Under the Scheme, the parties are required to enter into a dispute resolution agreement to record their consent.",
            "The process to be adopted is a multi-tiered dispute resolution mechanism where the parties will first attempt to negotiate their disputes, followed by mediation and if that does not result in settlement, then subsequently to arbitration for a final and binding award. This is in line with the “Mediate First” policy that we have been advocating under our “Mediate First” Pledge Programmes.",
            "The Scheme aims to offer a fast and effective means to resolve disputes among parties. Each tier of dispute resolution will be conducted within a limited time. The tiers are devised with a view to avoiding disputes and differences from being entrenched. If the disputes can be resolved successfully and amicably through negotiation or mediation, we hope it will help build and reinforce a harmonious society and enable the parties to preserve their long term business relationship.",
            "We also hope the Scheme will have the benefit of job creation and job advancement for mediators and arbitrators (including their pupils). Parties are at liberty to appoint the third party neutral of their choice and if no agreement is reached, there will be a mechanism for appointment. The third party neutrals and the parties or their representatives can still handle cases under the social distancing measures online and indeed to practice on the handling of cases online. We would like the Scheme to be launched in June if funding is provided in April.",
            "It is a global trend to develop and use ODR to provide reliable and efficient platform to facilitate alternative dispute resolution. The Scheme is in line with the development under Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation’s Collaborative Framework on ODR (APEC Framework), with MSMEs as the major beneficiary. The mechanism of adopting negotiation and mediation in the first stage under the APEC Framework is also to prevent entrenched views on the conflicts, thereby helping to create harmony in society.",
            "Some forms of alternative dispute resolution, such as mediation, are a more cost-effective way to resolve disputes. The costs of mediation are almost always lower than the disputed amounts, making it an economical way to resolve disputes. Mediation can save time too. Some cases may be resolved following just one day of mediation.",
            "LawTech has greatly helped the development of dispute resolution services. The establishment of a safe, reliable and credible platform to provide enterprises with convenient and cost-effective online dispute resolution will become a new trend.",
            "It is one of the major long-term policy objectives of the Department of Justice (DoJ) in recent years to enhance and promote Hong Kong’s status as an international legal hub for deal-making and dispute resolution. A further promotion of the use of ODR will help consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international business and financial centre.",
            "The social media accounts of DoJ’s IDAR Office has been introducing the procedure, characteristics and benefits of mediation and arbitration. You may wish to visit the dedicated pages of IDAR Office to keep abreast of the dispute resolution services.",
            "In addition to the relief measures announced by the Government, the DoJ has also taken the initiative to speed up payment of fees to counsel. Counsel engaged by the DoJ could submit their interim fee notes together with the interim case reports after certain work has been completed. Each case will be considered individually on a case-by-case basis and interim payments could be made. I have enquired and am also glad to learn from the Legal Aid Department and the Duty Lawyer Service that they made similar arrangements.",
            "We are confident that Hong Kong can weather the storm with our fundamental strengths and resilience. We also trust that we would overcome this unprecedented challenge by standing in solidarity.",

            "為應對新型冠狀病毒在全球和本地引起的經濟影響，政府在上周三公布了一系列措施支援企業、僱員和市民。其中兩項特別是與法律及爭議解決業界有關，分別是成立法律科技基金和推出新型冠狀病毒網上爭議解決計劃（COVID-19 ODR Scheme）。我早前在網誌已經簡單講解過法律科技基金（https://www.doj.gov.hk/chi/public/blog/20200411_blog1.html），今日我會介紹一下新型冠狀病毒網上爭議解決計劃。",
            "持續疫情為各行各業帶來衝擊，嚴重影響或打擊尤其中小微型企業的業務正常運作，預期糾紛也會增多。新型冠狀病毒網上爭議解決計劃的目標是提供一個快捷和具成本效益的途徑協助這些企業解決爭議。計劃是透過eBRAM（一邦國際網上仲調中心）提供網上爭議解決服務予一般市民和企業，處理一些爭議金額不高的案件。",
            "計劃的服務範圍包括：處理與新型冠狀病毒相關的爭議；每件案件的索償金額須於50萬元以下；當事人（原告人或答辯人）的其中一方必須是香港居民或公司；爭議雙方只需各付200元作為登記費用；當事人需同意在計劃下達成爭議解決協議。",
            "爭議解決的過程會使用多重方法，雙方會首先嘗試談判，之後會以調解方式處理，如果仍未能達成和解協議，就會透過仲裁程序取得一個終局和具有約束力的仲裁裁決。這個過程亦符合律政司一直推廣“調解為先”承諾書活動的目標，先以調解方式解決爭議。",
            "計劃不單提供一個便捷的平台解決爭議，每一個階段的爭議解決服務都會在指定限期內進行，用多層爭議解決方法處理糾紛的目的是希望防止分歧或爭議進一步擴大。假如爭議最終是透過談判或調解成功解決，我們期望這會有助建立及鞏固社會和諧，亦讓雙方可以維持長期良好的商業關係。",
            "我們亦希望計劃可以創造更多調解員和仲裁員（包括他們的學徒）的工作機會及提升工作效能，雙方可自由選擇中立第三者，假如雙方未能就此達成共識，計劃內有機制會代為委任。所有中立第三者和雙方或其代表律師均可以在保持社交距離的情況下在網上處理案件。如果順利在四月獲得撥款，我們希望計劃於六月推出。",
            "發展和使用網上爭議解決服務，提供可靠便捷的平台促進替代爭議解決是現時全球的趨勢。這項計劃實際上是與《亞太經合組織網上爭議解決的合作框架》（《合作框架》）的發展一致，都是目標以微中小企為最大的受惠者。就正如《合作框架》一樣，計劃會先從談判和調解開始，防止雙方衝突加劇，有助建立和諧社會。",
            "使用替代爭議解決方式，例如調解，更符合成本效益，在大部分的情況下，調解費用比爭議牽涉的金額為低。除了節省金錢，調解亦節省時間，一些調解案例僅需時一天便能解決爭議。",
            "而法律科技對爭議解決服務的發展有莫大幫助，一個構建安全、可靠及有公信力的平台為企業提供便捷及具成本效益的網上爭議解決方法，會成為新趨勢。",
            "律政司近年其中一個長期的主要政策目標，正是致力提升和推廣香港作為促成交易和爭議解決的國際法律樞紐地位，進一步推廣網上爭議解決服務有助我們達成這個目標，亦可鞏固香港作為國際商業及金融中心的地位。",
            "律政司普惠避免及解決爭議辦公室的社交專頁一直有向大家介紹調解及仲裁的流程、特點以及好處，大家可以多點前往這個專頁，了解關於爭議解決服務的最新資訊。",
            "除了政府公布的措施外，律政司亦採納了加快支付外判律師費的方案。受律政司委託的外判律師完成部分工作後，可向律政司遞交中期報告和相關收費通知書，律政司會按個別情況靈活處理，假如有關工作符合律政司的要求，律政司會先繳付已完成工作的費用。我早前亦與法律援助署和當值律師計劃了解過，很高興他們也作出了類似的特別安排。",
            "香港具備的優勢是根基穩固，社會復元能力強，我相信只要大家聯手，必定可以戰勝風浪。",
