            "In recent times, criminal damage has been repeatedly inflicted on our court buildings through graffiti. Some went as far as making derogatory remarks against specific judges which may amount to contempt of court. It is bewildering as to what such acts could achieve except a futile attempt to undermine the very core value that we cherish and respect.",
            "Judicial independence is the key building block to our society. These rampant acts and statements, and for that matter, any views expressed in society or media, would not in any way usurp the decision making process in court proceedings, nor will they affect our judicial independence as our judges will continue to decide cases based only on evidence and law, setting out how they have arrived at such decisions in their judgements, which are available to the general public. They have taken a judicial oath to administer justice without fear or favour and it is their duty to so do.",
            "Judges in Hong Kong are appointed upon the recommendation by a statutory committee comprising nine members including the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, the Secretary for Justice, two judges from the Judiciary, one barrister and one solicitor, as well as three eminent and respected members of the society not connected with the practice of law. Our judges would not be subjected to any political vetting. The only criteria upon which they are considered before appointment is the judicial and professional quality that contributes to our renowned judicial independence.",
            "Judges enjoy security of tenure and immunity. Upon the appointment, district court judges and above are precluded from returning to practice in Hong Kong as a barrister or a solicitor. This “non-revolving door” system has worked well in preventing perceived potential conflict of interest and enhance the independence of our judiciary.",
            "Our judges manifest the highest professional and judicial quality as well as impartiality through the reasoned judgements that they deliver. Hong Kong cases are often cited in overseas jurisprudence evidencing the confidence and respect of the global legal community in Hong Kong’s judicial and legal systems.",
            "The institutional framework described above, the guarantee of judicial independence explicitly set out in the Basic Law and the quality of our judgements contribute to the much respected judiciary and rule of law in Hong Kong. To top it all is that eminent and highly respected judges from apex court of other common law jurisdictions sit on our Court of Final Appeal as Non-Permanent Judges. They sit on all types of cases, from commercial, criminal to constitutional and have witnessed Hong Kong’s system in administering justice.",
            "One of our Non-Permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal, the Right Honourable the Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury (former President of the Supreme Court of England and Wales who presided the Brexit case), pointed out in a seminar in 2017 that his own direct experience as an Non-Permanent Judge since 2010 proved that the Permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal are as institutionally independent and impartial. He also said that he has every reason to believe that this is equally true of the judges in the other courts of Hong Kong. He even said he would not be sitting in the Court of Final Appeal if he had any serious concerns about judicial independence or judicial impartiality in Hong Kong.",
            "More recently, the Right Honourable Beverley McLachlin, PC, another Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal and also a retired chief justice of Canada, described in an interview ( https://nationalpost.com/news/courts-immune-to-pressure-from-china-ex-canadian-chief-justice-says-after-hong-kong-judging-stint) that Hong Kong’s law is very rigorously applied, the judges are very high calibre, it is a very high level of judging, and the court is independent.",
            "These remarks from eminent and respected judges from around the world speak volume about Hong Kong. One cannot help but be perplexed as to why some chose to try to undermine these core values baselessly and insidiously. It behoves on each of us, in particular the legal sector including the two branches of the legal profession, to protect our judicial independence that underpins Hong Kong’s success and encourage others to join hands through our own sphere of influence. It is high time we bring back the Hong Kong we are familiar with.",

            "最近有人接連以塗污的手段破壞終審法院及高等法院大樓，更有人辱罵個別法官，有可能觸犯藐視法庭。這些行為企圖損害我們一直珍惜及尊重的法治，令人難以理解目的何在。",
            "司法獨立是我們社會的重要根基。那些破壞行為、以及社會或媒體上所發表的意見，絕不應該干預法官的決定或司法獨立，因為法官是按證據和法律作出裁決，而判決書亦會陳述理由，市民可在司法機構的網頁參閱。法官上任時宣讀的誓言，已顯示他們必須以無懼無私的精神主持正義，這亦是他們的責任。",
            "我們的法官是根據獨立的司法人員推薦委員會推薦而任命，委員會成員包括終審法院首席法官、律政司司長、兩位法官、大律師及事務律師各一位，以及另外三名在社會上德高望重的業外人士。我們的法官不受政治審查，唯一考慮的因素就是他們的司法和專業才能，讓他們對香港聞名的司法獨立作出貢獻。",
            "法官享有任期和不受法律追究的保障，區域法院或以上級別的法官獲委任時，必須承諾任期完結後不會在香港執業為大律師或律師，這個不設“旋轉門”的決定，是免卻公眾對任何潛在利益衝突的疑慮，加強法官的獨立性，一直行之有效。",
            "我們法官的質素一直維持於最高水平，他們專業地以公正不阿的態度來處理案件，作出有理據的判決。香港的案例不時在海外被引用，這正好說明國際法律界對香港司法和法律制度的尊重和信任。",
            "司法機關的架構、《基本法》保障的司法獨立，以及高質素的法官，對我們備受尊崇的司法機構和法治貢獻良多。更重要的是，終審法院有來自其他普通法司法管轄區頂尖法院的傑出法官擔任非常任法官，他們處理不同種類的案件，包括商業、刑事以及憲制等，並親身體驗香港的制度如何施行公義。",
            "其中一名終審法院非常任法官廖柏嘉勳爵（前英國最高法院院長、曾處理英國脫歐案）於2017年在一個講座指出，他自2010年起出任非常任法官，親身經驗告訴他終審法院所有常任法官都是以公平公正的態度、獨立地審理案件，他相信其他級別法庭的法官亦是如此。他更表示，若然他對香港法院的獨立性和公平性有所質疑，便不會再出任非常任法官。這反映了其他司法管轄區的法官願意加入司法機構是建基於對我們司法制度和法庭獨立性的信任。",
            "另一位終審法院非常任法官、加拿大前首席法官麥嘉琳早前接受報章採訪（https://nationalpost.com/news/courts-immune-to-pressure-from-china-ex-canadian-chief-justice-says-after-hong-kong-judging-stint）時，表示她體驗到終審法院的獨立性，形容法庭不會因任何壓力而受影響，又認為我們的法律制度不大可能會惡化。",
            "享譽盛名的海外法官對香港的司法制度推崇備至，但現時竟然有人無理地企圖破壞我們這一個核心價值，令人不明所以。堅決地維護司法獨立—香港賴以成功的基石—是每一個香港市民，特別是法律界包括兩個法律專業團體的責任。現在是時候大家鼓勵身邊的人一同努力，盡快讓我們熟悉的香港再次重新出現。",
