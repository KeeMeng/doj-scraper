            "To ensure that the Government’s future work will be more responsive to the sentiments of the community, the Chief Executive announced last month that the style of governance had to be more open and inclusive. We had to reform the way we listen to public views too. The Government will meet with individuals from different walks of life and reach out to young people to maintain political awareness and gauge the pulse of the community.",
            "As part of the Government, my colleagues and I have been meeting with various legal professional bodies and individuals from the legal and dispute resolution services sector over the last month to listen to their views on the current situation. They were also invited to offer suggestions on the upcoming Policy Address. We will continue to gauge the views from the legal and dispute resolution sector and hope that our collective wisdom would enable the Government to formulate policies which cater to the different needs of the public.",
            "The Government has all along attached great importance to its communication with the youths. With the assistance from the International Youth Legal Exchange Federation, I was earlier given an opportunity to spend an enjoyable afternoon with a group of law students. The students, who joined the Mainland China Legal Internship Programme, just completed their one-month exchange at law firms, business organisations or arbitration institutions in Shanghai or Beijing. They shared with each other their experience and insights at the gathering. Most of them agreed that the programme had widened their horizon by learning more about the development of legal, economics and livelihood of our country. This invaluable experience would no doubt be beneficial to help them work with Mainland or overseas legal professionals and businessmen in future. They understood that they can only improve themselves by adopting a far-sighted and open-minded attitude while keeping abreast of the development of our country and the rest of the world.",
            "Some barristers and solicitors who are in private practice, as well as our government counsel were invited to share with the students about the different areas of legal services. I hope that this would help the students be better equipped and prepare themselves for their career development. Whilst encouraging them to visit more places to experience for themselves different legal systems, we also invited them to be Hong Kong’s ambassadors to promote our legal systems and competitive edges. I hope that during the course of study, they will grasp the chance to let more people learn about Hong Kong.",
            "Meeting with law students is the first step taken by the Department of Justice in line with the new style of governance. My colleagues and I are endeavoured to introduce more new measures to better gauge the public sentiments and ensure that our policies bring more benefits and convenience to the public.",

            "為確保政府日後工作更貼近民情，行政長官上月宣布政府的施政風格需要變得更開放、更包容，聽取民意的工作也要革新，政府會與不同階層、不同背景的人士，以及年輕人會面交流，以保持政治觸覺和掌握社會脈搏。",
            "作為政府團隊的一份子，我和我的同事在過去的一個多月，已經與不同的法律團體和法律及爭議解決服務的專業人士見面，聆聽了他們對現時社會的看法，同時就行政長官新一份《施政報告》徵詢了他們的意見。我們會繼續與法律及爭議解決服務界別的人士會晤，希望可以集思廣益，讓政府制訂切合市民需要的政策措施。",
            "政府十分重視與年輕人溝通，了解他們的想法。早前，我透過國際青年法律交流聯會的安排，跟一班法律學生度過了一個愉快的下午，這班學生參加了香港青年內地法律專業實習計劃，剛剛在上海或北京的律師事務所、商業機構和仲裁機構完成一個多月的實習。他們在聚會中分享了實習時的所見所聞，也表示內地實習的經驗擴闊了他們的視野，讓他們得悉國家在法律、經濟及民情等各方面的現況和發展。這些寶貴的經驗有助將來他們在執業過程中與內地或外國的法律界人士和企業的合作。他們明白必須將目光放遠，多留心國家和世界的發展，以開放態度接觸人和事，才能夠自我增值。",
            "今次的聚會還安排了一些私人執業的大律師、事務律師，以及政府律師，與學生們分享不同法律範疇的工作經驗，讓他們可以為日後事業發展做好準備。我們也鼓勵學生們多點“走出去”，體驗不同法律制度的同時，亦可以擔當香港宣傳大使的角色，多些介紹香港的法律制度和優勢。我希望他們在學習之餘，也把握機會讓其他人多些了解香港。",
            "與年輕的法律學生會面是律政司配合政府施政新風格的第一步，我與律政司的同事會繼續帶來新的安排，讓政府更能掌握民情，政策利民便民。",
