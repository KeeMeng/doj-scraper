            "The Basic Law 30th Anniversary Legal Summit was successfully concluded last Tuesday, following the Hong Kong Legal Week in early November. We were very privileged to have so many renowned legal professionals, experts and academics with expertise in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law to share their insights, which have greatly inspired the audience.",
            "Despite the fact that the Basic Law has been successfully implemented in Hong Kong over the years, there are still people who do not fully comprehend the Constitution and the Basic Law. Some mistakenly believe that the Constitution does not apply in Hong Kong or even forget that “one country” is the precondition of the “one country, two systems” principle. There are also people deliberately making statement about the Basic Law selectively, leading to misapprehensions. We hope that by going “Back to Basics”, the theme of the summit, it could help all of us to understand the Basic Law accurately. At the summit, Vice-Chairman of the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), Mr Zhang Yong, and the Chief Executive respectively mentioned “learning the new by reviewing the old” and “staying true to the original intention”, as being relevant when we look into the basics of the Basic Law. I fully agree. In order to get the true essence and meaning of the Basic Law, it is necessary to remind ourselves of its original intent. The Basic Law has only two purposes which have been clearly stated in the preamble: upholding national unity and territorial integrity, maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.",
            "Mr Zhang’s speech provided us with a clear and proper understanding of the relationship between the Constitution and the Basic Law. He explained that the constitutional basis of the HKSAR is formed by the Constitution and the Basic Law. He reiterated that China is a unitary state, meaning all powers come from the Central Authorities, and the powers enjoyed by the HKSAR are authorised by the Central Authorities. This is how the “one country, two systems” have to be understood. He further elaborated on the legal hierarchy of the Constitution, the Basic Law and the laws of the Special Administrative Region, as well as that of the legislatures at the national and the regional and Special Administrative Region levels. With this background, we would then be able to return to the basics so as to properly understand the Basic Law.",
            "The vice president of International Court of Justice, Judge Xue Hanqin, highlighted the contributions “one country, two systems” principle has made to the international law. The “one country, two systems” principle, which is an innovative concept, ensured Hong Kong’s smooth transition and return to the motherland. The Chinese and British governments resolved the dispute and their differences in looking at the situation that was left over from history by negotiations, leading to a peaceful settlement, thereby providing a good example for implementation of the international law.",
            "At the panel discussion session, various legal experts shared with us the process by which the Basic Law was drafted and also their views on its legislative intent. Former Chairman of the Committee for the Basic Law of the HKSAR under the NPCSC, Mr Qiao Xiaoyang, clearly presented that the concept of the “Chief Executive System” has been adopted in Hong Kong’s political system and pointed out that the executive-led system is supported by a number of provisions in the Basic Law. Mr Qiao also provided six keys to study the Basic Law. Allow me to recap here. First, one must view the Basic Law from the national perspective. Second, it must be understood that the constitutional status of the Basic Law is from the Constitution. Third, the Basic Law is an “authorisation law”. Fourth, the Basic Law should be understood in its entirety. Fifth, the “one country, two systems” principle is the basic for implementing the Basic Law. And sixth, the Basic Law should be implemented with the people and their development in mind. No matter how familiar you are with the Basic Law, I encourage all of you to review the insightful presentations(https://www.legalhub.gov.hk/events_detail.php?a=115&v%5b%5d=basic-law-30-sup-th-sup-anniversary-legal-summit-back-to-basics) by all the speakers of the summit.",
            "I am delighted to know that the summit gave us an opportunity to walk through the interpretation of the Basic Law, and have a deeper understanding of the responsibility of maintaining national security under “one country” as well as the overall situation of national security laws in China. At the same time, with “one country” as the root, the “two systems” under the “one country, two systems” principle have also brought us tremendous benefits. CEPA has achieved numerous favourable results in terms of reciprocal benefits and complementarity, thereby opening up ample business opportunities for the legal sector. The mutual legal assistance and the interim measures arrangement have further enhanced Hong Kong’s international arbitration services by consolidating our status as a centre for dispute resolution.",
            "I am indebted to all the speakers and guests who either physically attended the summit or joined us online. Their wisdom has enlightened the audience on how the Basic Law has been successfully implemented, allowing us to go back to the basics and reflecting on the original intent and purpose of “one country, two systems”. Looking forward, I wish we could join hands to consolidate the foundation of the Basic Law with a view to ensuring the continued success of \"one country, two systems\"",

            "繼十一月初的香港法律周，律政司在上星期二舉辦了《基本法》頒布三十周年法律高峰論壇，我們很榮幸邀請了多名熟悉中國《憲法》及《基本法》的知名法律界人士、專家和學者，分享了他們的真知灼見，令與會者獲益良多。",
            "《基本法》在香港成功落實多年，但仍然有些人不完全理解《憲法》和《基本法》，或是誤以為《憲法》在香港不適用，甚至乎忘記「一國兩制」的前提就是「一國」，也有些人故意對《基本法》作出選擇性的解讀，最終引起了很多誤解，因此律政司希望藉著論壇讓大家追本溯源，正確認識《基本法》。全國人大常委會香港特別行政區基本法委員會副主任張勇和行政長官在論壇上分別提到對理解《基本法》的基礎時需要「溫故知新」和必須「毋忘初心」，我非常認同他們的想法，要融會貫通《基本法》，就必須要理解它的初心，它只有兩個目的，而且已經在序言中寫得很清楚：「維護國家的統一和領土完整，保持香港的繁榮和穩定」。",
            "張勇主任的演講讓大家清晰理解《憲法》與《基本法》的關係，以及由《憲法》與《基本法》所共同構成的特區憲制基礎。他亦重申了中國是單一制國家，因此權力來自中央，而特區的一切權力也是中央授予，這是正確理解「一國兩制」的運作。他之後透過法律位階圖講解了《憲法》、《基本法》以及特區法律的制度，並細述由國家層面，以至特區及各地方的立法機關。有了這個背景，我們可以循一個正確方向去追本溯源。",
            "國際法院副院長薛捍勤法官向我們說明「一國兩制」對國際法的貢獻，由於有「一國兩制」這個創新的概念，因此香港得以平穩過渡，順利回歸，中英雙方當時以協商的手段和平解決爭端，成功處理了歷史遺留下來的問題，同時也為國際法實踐提供了一個典範。",
            "在座談會上，幾位法律界專家就《基本法》的立法原意分享了當時的討論過程以及他們的看法。原全國人民代表大會常務委員會香港特別行政區基本法委員會主任喬曉陽明確指出了香港的政治體制是行政長官制的概念，並提到《基本法》內有很多條文都是支持行政主導。喬主任亦指出應該如何理解《基本法》的關鍵所在，容許我再次複述，第一：要始終堅持站在國家立場上來看待基本法；第二，要始終堅持基本法的憲制性地位是憲法賦予的來認識基本法；第三，要始終堅持基本法是一部授權法來把握基本法；第四，要始終堅持基本法的所有規定是有機聯繫的整體來理解基本法；第五，要始終堅持從「一國兩制」的根本宗旨來實施基本法；第六，要始終堅持以人民為中心的發展思想來落實基本法。無論大家對《基本法》的認識有多深，我都鼓勵各位重溫(https://www.legalhub.gov.hk/events_detail.php?l=tc&a=115&v%5b%5d=)當日所有講者的精闢見解。",
            "我很高興論壇令我們有機會回顧《基本法》釋法的實踐和加深認識特區在「一國原則」下履行維護國家安全的責任及國安法在全國的整體情況。與此同時，有「一國」作為基礎，「兩制」在「一國兩制」運作下亦為我們帶來莫大的裨益，當中CEPA實現了互惠互利、優勢互補的效用，甚至為法律界開啟新機遇，至於司法互助和保全安排更有助提升香港的國際仲裁服務，鞏固我們爭議解決中心的地位。",
            "我在此再次感謝所有出席論壇的講者和嘉賓，不論是親身出席或是透過網上參與，他們的分享讓我們清楚理解《基本法》在香港回歸後落實執行的正面發展情況、探索《基本法》的根源及提高了社會大眾正確認識「一國兩制」的初衷。繼往開來，我更希望大家可以為《基本法》固本培元，讓「一國兩制」行穩致遠。",
