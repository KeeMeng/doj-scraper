            "The Chief Justice listed six indicators of the rule of law at the ceremony for the admission of the new senior counsel last year. One of which is “the public has access to the reasons for the outcome of any court proceedings”. He also described that judgments containing reasons in arriving at the legal result made publicly available are a manifestation of the spirit of the rule of law.",
            "At the ceremonial opening of the legal year 2020, I highlighted the importance of reinforcing the societal recognition and implementation of the rule of law in Hong Kong, outlining an initiative which spans over 10 years for the promotion and education of the rule of law. One of the short term targets is strengthening the community’s understanding and practice of it through promotion, education and capacity building. To achieve this objective, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has devised plans to roll out public education projects for various sectors, including the general public.",
            "Rational and constructive exchanges of views on court decisions will help promote the awareness of the concept of rule of law in society. While there are frequent discussions about the outcome of a case, little is reported relating to the reasoning that set out the legal and evidential basis of the judgment. Only by looking at the reasoning of a judgment will one be able to apprehend the basis of the decision and then to participate in an informed discussion. In Hong Kong, judgments are available at the Judiciary’s website.",
            "However, judgments are usually thorough and hence inevitably long. Issues involved in a case can be plentiful and complicated, necessitating both factual and legal analysis. They will also contain legal concepts that may not be easy to understand. These features may unfortunately deter some members of the general public from embarking on a perusal of the judgment.",
            "Since 2018, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has set up a dedicated page “Summary of Notable Judgments” to provide a brief account of the main points in notable judgments by the High Court (Court of First Instance and Court of Appeal) and the Court of Final Appeal. Cases are selected on the basis that they involve significant legal principles, issues of public interest, or that they are of general interest to the community. We hope that the public, by reading the summaries, will not only be able to grasp the most important aspects of the judgments, but also experience the analytical process undertaken by the judge when dispensing justice.",
            "In each summary, we provide a brief background, legal issues arising from the dispute, and main points of the decisions by the court. However, we do not include our own points of view in the summary so as to enable the readers to get to know the reasons for the decisions in an objective way.",
            "The duty of judges is to adjudicate cases before them in accordance with law and evidence. This is done by taking all admissible evidence in context and applying the same to the law objectively and impartially. Similarly, it is equally important for one to avoid making over-generalised view or passing judgment on a matter based only on versions from one side. Instead, we should remain in a reasonable and objective manner by adopting an open mind, considering all relevant facts and analysing from different perspectives before we come to any conclusion.",
            "Yet, judges may err too. There may be situations in which the parties have to consider taking the matter further to appeal. When the judge’s decision in the case was wrong by erring in law, in fact, or in the exercise of his/ her discretion; or if the decision was unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity, the DoJ will have to decide whether or not to appeal or in the case of criminal cases to appeal by way of case stated, or institute review of sentence, etc. Our decisions have to be made in accordance with legal principles and court procedures and a result of our careful analysis of the case in context.",
            "We hope that the “Summary of Notable Judgments” on the DoJ website will encourage the general public to be better informed of how our legal system operates and to be more interested in the correct principles of law that are akin to our daily lives. We share the same objective with the Secretary for Education to foster the right values of students by helping them to better understand the Basic Law and the spirit of the rule of law. In the near future, the DoJ will roll out more capacity building programmes and further strengthen collaboration with local and international stakeholders with a view to achieving our mission of “Rule of Law and Justice for All”.",

            "終審法院首席法官在去年資深大律師委任典禮的演辭中列出了六項法治的指標，其中一點是「市民大眾可以知悉任何法庭程序結果的理由」。向公眾公開發布法庭詳列判決理由，正正體現了司法制度的法治精神。",
            "在年初舉行的法律年度開啟典禮，我於致辭中強調鞏固香港對法治的認識及實踐十分重要，並提及一項歷時十年的計劃提升社會大眾對法治的正確理解和認識。計劃其中一個短期目標是透過推廣、教育及能力建設，加深社會對法治的認識及實踐。為達成這個目標，律政司將推出不同的公眾教育項目，向各個界別包括普羅大眾，宣傳正確的法治觀念。",
            "理性和建設性討論法庭裁決有助提升社會對法治概念的意識。但有時大家太著重案件的結果，而忽略了闡述判決所涉及的法律和證據基礎。只有了解裁決的理據，大家才能夠理性地參與社會上的討論。在香港，司法機構已將判案書上載至其網站。",
            "不過，判案書很多時都會把法律觀點詳加解釋，因此無可避免篇幅會比較長。案件亦可能涉及很多複雜的問題，既需要事實分析也需要法律說明，當中還包括一些艱澀的法律概念，或會令一些有興趣閱讀判案書的人卻步。",
            "律政司在二零一八年在網站推出了「重要判決摘要」的專頁，為高等法院（原訟法庭及上訴法庭）和終審法院所頒下的重要判決整理為摘要。我們選取的案件，都是涉及事關重要的法律原則、關乎公眾利益，又或是廣受社會關注。我們希望這份摘要能夠協助普羅大眾了解判決的重點之餘，還可以讓大家理解法官秉行公義時如何作出決定。",
            "每份摘要都列出案件的簡單背景資料、法律爭議點以及法庭裁決的要點，但當中絕不會加入任何個人意見，目的是希望大家能夠客觀地了解法官作出裁決的理據。",
            "法官的職責是按法律和證據來審理案件，這必須要透過客觀公正地考慮整體可接納的證據和適用法律才能夠做到。同樣重要的是，大家都應該要避免以偏概全，不應只根據片面之詞便妄下定論。相反，在得出任何結論之前，我們應該以理性和客觀的態度，虛心和慎重地考慮所有相關因素，以及從不同角度就事件進行分析。",
            "當然，任何人都會犯錯，法官也不例外。在某些情況下，控辯雙方需要考慮就裁決提出上訴。當法官在法律觀點上犯錯、錯誤地運用酌情權，或由於嚴重的程序或其他失當而導致裁決不公，律政司便要決定是否對案件提出上訴，或者在刑事案件中以呈述方式提出上訴、或申請覆核刑期等。律政司的所有決定都是根據法律原則和法庭程序，以及經過仔細研究整體案情才作出的。",
            "我們希望「重要判決摘要」可以讓大眾更了解法律制度的運作，並且對一些與我們息息相關的正確法律原則感到興趣。我們亦與教育局局長的目標一致，透過向學生灌輸《基本法》和法治精神，從而培養他們的正確價值觀。律政司在未來會繼續推動提升能力建設項目和加強與本地和國際持份者的協作，以達成「法治公義、普惠共享」的目標。",
