            "Many people might have a negative impression on corporate insolvency and debt restructuring. Some even avoid talking about them. But from the legal perspective, a modernised and efficient insolvency regime is in fact favourable for business and investment. On May 14, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Supreme People's Court signed the Record of Meeting on Mutual Recognition of and Assistance to Bankruptcy (Insolvency) proceedings between the Courts of the Mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), allowing liquidators from Hong Kong to apply to Mainland courts for recognition of insolvency proceedings in Hong Kong. Likewise, bankruptcy administrators from the Mainland may apply to the High Court in Hong Kong for recognition of bankruptcy proceedings in the Mainland.",
            "This new cooperation mechanism comes with three advantages, two breakthroughs and one goal. The advantages include:",
            "(1) Balance and protect the interests of creditors and debtors: the establishment of a system for mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings and assistance to liquidators between the two places avoids the inability to fully recover the debtors’ assets due to lack of mechanism, thereby enhancing the protection of the interests of debtors and creditors which is conducive to the orderly and fair handling of the relevant stakeholders’ interests.",
            "(2) Make use of debt restructuring to reduce unemployment: it encourages enterprises to make use of debt restructuring procedures to facilitate creditors to reach a consensus on the restructuring plan as soon as possible. Companies under financial distress can reduce the risk of liquidation through debt restructuring and therefore prevent layoffs.",
            "(3) Further improve business environment and encourage investment: the mechanism collectively built by the two places will give additional assurance to creditors and investors, thus further improving the investment and business environment.",
            "The cooperation mechanism, implemented through pilot cities, connecting the procedures and rules between Hong Kong and the Mainland, marks an important move for judicial assistance between the two places and has achieved two breakthroughs:",
            "(1) The signing of the record of meeting signifies a major breakthrough by fully reflecting the uniqueness of “one country, two systems” as Hong Kong becomes the only jurisdiction outside the Mainland where mutual recognition of and assistance to insolvency proceedings are allowed. It highlights the trust of our country in Hong Kong’s judicial system and the firm support for Hong Kong to become an international legal hub.",
            "(2) In devising the cooperation mechanism, reference has been made to relevant international rules, including certain principles in the UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency issued in 1997. However, the mechanism is much more extensive and in-depth, and is more in line with the needs and development of the two places. The cooperation mechanism expressly covers bankruptcy compromise and reorganization in the Mainland as well as debt restructuring in Hong Kong, which allow debtors, creditors and other stakeholders to understand the scope of application of it, thereby encouraging the rescue of enterprises through reorganization or restructuring.",
            "Through the implementation of the “one country, two systems” policy and leveraging Hong Kong’s uniqueness as the only common law jurisdiction in China, the most important aim of the cooperation mechanism is to explore the rules governing cross-border insolvency at first, and then further provide high quality cross-boundary legal and dispute resolution services with a view to contributing to the promotion of rule of law involving foreign parties and the building of rule of law in China.",
            "On the day of signing the record of meeting, the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court held a forum on legal and practical issues concerning cross-boundary insolvency co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong and introduced the co-operation mechanism, with over 500 registrations for attendance. About half of them came from Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the DoJ has issued a practical guide to briefly explain the key procedure of applying for recognition and assistance from Hong Kong courts. We are exploring the opportunity of organizing another seminar to further explain the relevant information and operational details of the cooperation mechanism between the two places to the legal sector.",
            "In the long run, more businesses will be attracted to invest in Hong Kong, which in turn will consolidate the city's role as a platform for enterprises to tap into the Mainland market. Also, businesses may choose Hong Kong law as the applicable law for their contracts when investing in the Mainland. To give a better understanding of the advantages of using Hong Kong law, the DoJ will hold a webinar entitled \"Why Use Hong Kong Law\" on May 31. Representatives from legal sector will present an objective analysis and exchange views with the audience.",

            "很多人都對公司清盤和債務重組有一個負面印象，甚至避而不談。但從法律層面來看，一個現代化及高效率的清盤制度其實是有利於營商及投資。律政司在五月十四日與最高人民法院簽訂了《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院相互認可和協助破產程序的會談紀要》（《會談紀要》），容許香港的清盤人向內地法院申請認可在香港的清盤程序，同時，內地的破產管理人亦可以向香港高等法院申請認可在內地的破產程序。",
            "這項合作機制帶出了三個優點、兩個突破和一個目標。優點包括：",
            "（一）平衡及保障債權人和債務人利益：建立兩地相互認可清盤程序和相互協助清盤人的制度，可加強保護債權人和債務人的利益，避免因為缺乏機制而無法完全收回債務人資產，有利於公平有序處理相關持份者的利益。",
            "（二）善用債務重組減低失業：合作機制鼓勵企業多一點利用重組程序，使債權人可盡早就重組計劃達成共識，令到受財困的公司透過債務重組減低清盤的機會，加強保障就業。",
            "（三）優化營商環境並鼓勵投資：這套由兩地共同建立的合作機制，有助增加債權人和投資者的信心，進一步完善投資和營商環境。",
            "今次合作機制以試點形式與香港的程序和規則進行銜接，邁出了兩地司法協助的重要之舉並創出兩大突破：",
            "（一）簽署《會談紀要》充分體現「一國兩制」的獨特性，香港成為內地以外唯一的司法管轄區容許進行相互認可和協助破產的程序，突顯國家信任香港的司法制度以及堅定支持香港作為國際法律樞紐。",
            "（二）合作機制參考了國際相關的規則，包括聯合國貿法會（聯合國國際貿易法委員會）一九九七年頒布的《跨境破產示範法》的若干原則。然而，兩地的合作機制相比《跨境破產示範法》更有深度、寬度和清晰度，也更切合兩地的需要和發展。合作機制明確涵蓋內地的破產和解和重整程序，以及香港的債務重組程序，這樣清晰的表述，讓債務人、債權人和其他持份者都清楚掌握合作機制的適用範圍，有利於鼓勵透過重整或重組拯救企業。",
            "而合作機制最重要的目標，是透過落實「一國兩制」以及香港作為中國境內唯一實行普通法的司法管轄區，先行探索跨境清盤合作規則，再進一步提供跨境高質素法律及爭議解決服務，成為國家發展的助力，推展涉外法治化建設，為「法治中國」獻出力量。",
            "深圳市中級人民法院在《會談紀要》簽署的當天，舉辦了一個有關內地與香港跨境清盤合作的法律與實務的論壇，講解合作機制，吸引了超過五百人報名參加，當中大約一半來自香港。同時，律政司已推出實用指南，簡要說明向香港法院提出申請認可和協助的程序要點；我們現時正探討再次舉辦論壇，為業界解釋兩地合作機制的內容及運作細節。",
            "長遠而言，這會吸引更多企業在港投資，有利香港作為企業進軍內地投資的平台，除此以外，企業在內地投資時可使用香港法律作為合同的適用法律，為協助大家進一步了解香港法律的優點，律政司已定於本月三十一日舉辦「為何使用香港法律」的網上論壇，邀請法律界的代表向大家客觀分析和交流。",
