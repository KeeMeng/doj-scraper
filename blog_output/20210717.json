            "The National Security Law (NSL) has been implemented for more than a year. The Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xia Baolong, presented a review and outlook of the law at a thematic forum held by the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies. Today, I would like to share with you my views.",
            "Since the NSL has taken effect, it halted the chaos and restored the order in our society. Vigilantism are no longer prevalent and people are free to voice different views openly. Our love for Hong Kong and our motherland can be expressed in an open and aboveboard manner, and people are more respectful of the rights of others while exercising their own. Even though many western countries have launched malicious attacks on the NSL either out of misunderstanding or with a deliberate attempt to mislead, our economic data in the past year, including the funds raised through initial public offerings and the total deposits in the Hong Kong banking system, has proved that Hong Kong's business environment is becoming more attractive, and that international investors' confidence in Hong Kong has been enhanced rather than deterred. These hard facts can surely debunk the lies smearing the NSL.",
            "Mr Xia mentioned in his speech that with the NSL in place, the HKSAR has established a \"firm wall made of bronze and iron\" in safeguarding national security. He said that officials and patriots in the HKSAR have acted fearlessly in the face of illegal and groundless sanctions by the United States, showing their unwavering love for the country. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Police, being the loyal guardians of the city's stability and national security, have been strictly enforcing the NSL.",
            "Hong Kong's destiny has always been closely linked to that of our motherland, and Hong Kong people have been contributing to the country in different eras. The central authorities will continue to uphold the principle of “one country, two systems” unswervingly, ensuring its full implementation without being altered or deformed. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of Communist Party of China (CPC). General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President Xi Jinping pointed out that the second centenary goal is to build China into a great modern socialist country in all respects. But where will the future of the implementation of \"one country, two systems\" in Hong Kong lie? I am of the view that one must understand \"one country\" is the prerequisite of \"two systems\". By building a solid foundation of \"one country\" with the full implementation of the NSL and strictly adhering to the \"one country, two systems\" principle, the \"two systems\" can make the most of its competitive edges. Hong Kong will definitely have a brighter future with \"Security\" bringing \"Prosperity\".",
            "It is therefore necessary to have the NSL to foster Hong Kong’s immense potential for further development. The responsibility of in-depth implementation of the NSL should be shouldered by our society as a whole. The Department of Justice, apart from handling cases of endangering national security strictly in accordance with the NSL and local laws, will also step up the promotion of the national identity among different sectors of the community, enhancing their correct understanding of the Constitution, the Basic Law and the NSL.",
            "A solid system needs an efficient administration for implementation. In addition to genuinely upholding the Basic Law, bearing allegiance to the country and the HKSAR, possessing talents and virtues as well as the administrative capabilities, the governing team should also fulfil five specific requirements as pointed out by Mr Xia: (1) being staunch patriots; (2) having strategic thinking and a broad vision to resolve tough problems with a strong sense of responsibility; (3) serving the public with practical actions; (4) rallying and uniting all sectors; and (5) acting in the best interest of the country and the city and perform their duties faithfully.",
            "The stronger the bottom line of \"one country\", the greater the room for \"two systems\", and hence a better tomorrow for Hong Kong.",

            "《香港國安法》實施了一年，國務院港澳事務辦公室主任夏寶龍先生在全國港澳研究會舉辦的專題研討會上作出了回顧與展望，我希望透過今天的網誌與大家分享一下我的感受。",
            "《香港國安法》生效之後，社會由亂及治，「私了」不再普遍出現，大家可以自由地公開表達不同意見，更可以理直氣壯表達愛國愛港的情懷，市民行使權利時也會尊重別人的權利。雖然很多西方國家惡意攻擊《香港國安法》，無論他們是誤解或故意誤導，過去一年的經濟數據，包括首次公開招股集資額及銀行體系的總存款額，都印證了香港的營商環境比以前變得更吸引，亦顯示了國際投資者對香港的信心有增無減，這些鐵一般的事實足以令到詆毀國安法的謊言不攻自破。",
            "夏主任在講話中提到特區已全力築起維護國家安全的「銅牆鐵壁」，《香港國安法》已落地生根。他說：「面對美國非法無理制裁，特別行政區官員及愛國愛港人士無懼無畏、大義凜然，表現出了愛國者的錚錚鐵骨。其次，香港警隊『忠誠護國安、勇毅保家安』，嚴正執行香港國安法。」",
            "香港的命運一直與祖國緊密相連，香港同胞在不同時期都為國家作出了貢獻。中央對「一國兩制」的方針不會變、不動搖，亦同時確保「一國兩制」實踐不變形、不走樣。今年是中國共產黨成立100周年，習近平總書記指明了第二個百年奮鬥目標是全面建成社會主義的現代化強國。那麼「一國兩制」在香港的實踐將會是甚麼景象？我認為大家必須要理解「一國」是「兩制」的前提，打好「一國」的基礎，繼續全面落實《香港國安法》，堅守「一國兩制」的原則，「兩制」才可以發揮優勢，香港的前程必定會更美好，「國安」必定會帶來「家好」。",
            "因此，香港大有可為就必須要有《香港國安法》保駕護航，深入實施《香港國安法》的工作需由整個社會共同承擔。律政司除了會嚴格按照《香港國安法》以及本地法律處理涉及危害國家安全的案件外，亦會加強向社會各界推廣國家觀念、對《憲法》、《基本法》和《香港國安法》的正確理解。",
            "堅穩的制度需要由優良的管治團隊來執行。管治者除了要真誠擁護《基本法》、效忠國家和特區、才德兼備和擁有管治能力外，夏主任特別列出五項條件：（一）立場堅定的愛國者；（二）勇於擔當、能夠處理難題、具備戰略思維和宏闊眼光；（三）為民眾辦實事；（四）善於團結各方面力量；及（五）盡忠職守，在其位謀其政。",
            "「一國」的安全底線越牢，「兩制」才有更多空間，香港的明天便會更好。",
