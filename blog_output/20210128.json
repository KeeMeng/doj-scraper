            "Exposure to the work in international organisations is important to the sustainable growth of a professional, capable and well-informed legal community and the development of Hong Kong’s position as a leading international legal and dispute resolution services centre. To this end, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has been maintaining close liaison with international organisations to arrange secondment for lawyers in both public and private sectors. These opportunities provide valuable on-the-job training for fostering our legal talents in diverse areas of international law.",
            "Further to a visit I made to The Hague, the Netherlands in April 2019, and by reference to a precedent where the current Commissioner of IDAR Office was seconded in 2001, a standing agreement was reached for local lawyers to be seconded to the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH). On December 22 last year, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Secretary General of the HCCH, Dr Christophe Bernasconi, for the technical and administrative arrangements relating to the secondment of legal professionals at a virtual ceremony. I thank eBRAM for providing the technological support to make the digital signing possible notwithstanding the pandemic.",
            "This is the first standing arrangement for legal professionals in both the public and private sectors from Hong Kong to be seconded to the Permanent Bureau of the HCCH for a short-term placement. Secondment usually confines to government officials but we reached an agreement with the HCCH that private legal practitioners are also allowed to join the programme. The duration of the secondment is normally six to 12 months. With the support from the Hong Kong Government, successful applicants from the private sector will receive a monthly allowance of HK$50,000 from the HCCH. My deepest gratitude goes to the Central People’s Government and the HCCH for their tremendous support.",
            "The secondment programme with the HCCH is now open for application until February 18. I encourage local lawyers (Hong Kong permanent residents with Chinese nationality), who are either in private practice or working in the Government or public bodies, to seize this opportunity to broaden his/ her perspective and gain unique experience working at the HCCH.",
            "There is a growing number of cases in civil, commercial, criminal and family-related matters which require cross-jurisdictional legal services. Knowledge in private international law becomes an inevitable tool in the practice of law.",
            "This secondment programme with the HCCH presents a promising pathway to work in an international organisation where participants could gain top-notch experience in issues in private international law and broaden their horizons through collaborating with international law experts. It also provides a valuable opportunity for participants to hone their leadership skills through engaging in different projects and experiencing the global development of international law. Such exposure will undoubtedly benefit their future career advancement. These secondees could become ambassadors of Hong Kong and these international organisations could connect with Hong Kong’s legal talents, which will help raise Hong Kong’s profile and facilitate further co-operation.",
            "Needless to say, the HCCH, a global inter-governmental organisation, enjoys a very prestigious status in the field of private international law. With currently 87 Members (86 States and the European Union), the HCCH develops and services multilateral legal instruments in a wide range of areas from commercial law and banking law to international civil procedure, responding to the global needs.",
            "Over the years, the HCCH and the DoJ have been collaborating closely on various projects. We are delighted that the HCCH's Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific has moved into the former French Mission Building, which forms an important part of the Hong Kong Legal Hub. This secondment programme marks another milestone for the long-standing partnership between the two organisations.",
            "Working in The Hague will be a unique experience. The International Court of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration and The Hague Academy of International Law are all housed in the Peace Palace, a historic and elegant architecture. The Peace Palace Library of International Law, having the best collection of literature on international law, is a place not to be missed by those who love research in this area.",
            "For legal practitioners who are interested in the programme, please visit our dedicated webpage at https://www.doj.gov.hk/en/miscellaneous/secondment_programmes_to_international_organisations.html for further details and application. We are exploring with other international organisations for secondment opportunities for our legal professionals.",

            "在國際機構工作累積經驗，對專業、能幹和具備見識的法律界來說，是一個促成可持續發展的關鍵因素，亦有助鞏固香港作為全球主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。因此，律政司積極與國際組織進行磋商，期望為本地公私營機構的律師作出借調安排，讓他們在不同的國際法領域培訓，獲取寶貴的工作經驗。",
            "繼二○一九年四月我到訪荷蘭海牙，以及借鑑了普惠避免及解決爭議辦公室主任在二○○一年調派往海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）的經驗，我們與海牙會議就借調人員安排取得共識。去年十二月二十二日，我與海牙會議秘書長Christophe Bernasconi博士在網上簽署諒解備忘錄，雙方就法律專業人員借調計劃的技術及行政安排達成協議。我感謝一邦國際網上仲調中心在疫情下為網上簽署儀式提供了技術支援。",
            "這項借調計劃是首個恆常安排，讓香港公營機構工作或私人執業的法律專業人員在海牙會議常設局短期工作。調派往國際機構工作的安排，一般都局限於政府人員，但我們成功跟海牙會議達成協議，讓私人執業的律師也可報名參加，工作為期一般半年至一年，在香港政府的支持下，海牙會議會向成功申請的私人執業律師提供每月港幣50,000元的津貼。我衷心感謝中央政府及海牙會議對這項計劃的鼎力支持。",
            "借調計劃由現時開始直至二月十八日接受申請，我鼓勵本地的律師(具中國籍的香港永久居民)，不論是私人執業、或是在政府或公營機構工作，把握機會增廣見聞，獲取在海牙會議工作的獨特經驗。",
            "現時很多民事、商事、刑事及家事的案件，都有可能涉及多於一個司法管轄區，國際私法確保了相關法律可在跨境層面有效地運作。學習國際私法的知識對從事法律執業會發揮莫大的作用。",
            "這項計劃為香港法律界提供了一條通往國際組織工作的路徑，讓他們加深對國際私法的認識，與國際法專家交流亦會有助他們擴闊視野。借調人員參與不同項目和親身體驗國際法在全球的發展，可從中鍛煉領導能力，對他們日後繼續從事法律工作必定會帶來裨益。他們同時亦是香港的大使，讓國際機構得以接觸香港的法律人才，進一步提升香港在國際社會的形象，開拓日後合作的機會。",
            "不用我多說也知道海牙會議是在國際私法領域享負盛名的全球性政府間國際組織；目前擁有87個成員（86個國家以及歐洲聯盟），海牙會議發展和提供範圍廣泛的多邊法律文書服務，由商法和銀行法以至國際民事訴訟程序，應付全球需要。",
            "多年來，海牙會議與律政司一直在不同範疇緊密合作。我們樂見海牙會議亞太區域辦事處去年年底遷入前法國外方傳道會大樓，成為香港法律樞紐的一份子。今次的安排正好標誌著海牙會議與律政司作為長期合作伙伴的另一個里程碑。",
            "在海牙工作，是一個不可多得的經歷。國際法院、常設仲裁法院和海牙國際法學院均坐落於建築優雅的和平宫(Peace Palace)內，而和平宮國際法圖書館更擁有豐富的國際法藏書，對喜歡研究國際法的人來說是絕不可錯過的地方。",
            "有興趣參與計劃的律師，歡迎瀏覽律政司的專頁https://www.doj.gov.hk/tc/miscellaneous/secondment_programmes_to_international_organisations.html，進一步了解相關的資料及申請方法。我們正在與不同的國際組織磋商，期望讓香港的法律專業人員獲得更多的借調機會。",
