            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) is exploring a proposal to enable all legal officers serving in the Government (DoJ and some other Government departments) to be appointed as Senior Counsel. I wish to clarify all the unwarranted misunderstanding through the blog article today.",
            "Aligns with existing regime and merit-based selection principles",
            "In accordance with the existing arrangement, an eligible barrister may apply for appointment as Senior Counsel. The Chief Justice, may, after consultation with the Chairman of the Bar and the President of the Law Society, make the appointment. According to section 31(A) of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance, the eligibility requirements for the appointment include: (1) sufficient ability and standing, sufficient knowledge of law; (2) requisite experience; and (3) practising as an advocate. The proposal does not change the current regime and the criteria for appointment. I trust that the Chairman of the Bar and the President of the Law Society would duly consider the eligibility of each applicant before tendering their fair and honest advice to the Chief Justice for his consideration.",
            "Therefore, the proposal does not change the necessary ability and experience required by Senior Counsel and aligns with the merit-based selection principle.",
            "Legal officers perform both advocacy and non-advocacy duties",
            "The functions of legal officers and private legal practitioners are different. The proposal reflects the fact that there is no practical distinction between the duties of legal officers who are solicitors or barristers.",
            "Legal professionals in private practice are broadly categorised into two main streams: solicitors and barristers. However, legal officers in the Government, regardless of whether they are solicitors or barristers, have the rights of audience at all levels of courts. In fact, legal officers perform both solicitorial and advocacy duties. In other words, legal officers who are not admitted as a barrister in Hong Kong can also be assigned with advocacy duties. Legal officers who have satisfied the eligibility requirements under section 31(A) of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance deserve the same opportunity for consideration to be appointed Senior Counsel as a recognition of their competence. The different role of solicitors and barristers in private practice would not be confused if one apprehends a good understanding of the work of legal officers.",
            "The proposal is in the public interest",
            "In addressing the Ceremony for the Admission of the New Senior Counsel, the Chief Justice expressed that “[t]he power of appointment, like all public law powers, must be exercised for the furthering of the public interest. Indeed it is this public interest that underscores the unique status and responsibilities of the rank of Senior Counsel… As a badge of responsibility, it denotes our community’s trust and expectation that an appointee will put his or her excellence and experience to good use by faithfully discharging the responsibilities placed on them, thereby serving the public interest.”",
            "The proposal encourages legal officers who shoulder important public functions and enables them to be recognised by judicial and legal sectors for their excellence, which is in line with the public interest.",
            "Arrangement for outgoing legal officers",
            "The proposal suggests that legal officers, who are appointed as a Senior Counsel in the new regime and left the Government service, shall no longer carry the title of Senior Counsel.",
            "Matters relating to private practice should be dealt with by the self-regulatory regime, which is duly respected, in accordance with the established procedures and rules of the legal professional bodies.",
            "All legal officers, regardless of solicitors or barristers, deserve fair treatment and rights. In recognition of their competence and achievements, legal officers should be equally eligible for appointment as Senior Counsel upon satisfying the requirements under section 31(A) of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance.",

            "律政司現正探討容許政府（包括律政司及一些其他政府部門）的所有律政人員可獲資格被委任為資深大律師的建議，我希望透過今日的網誌向大家講解多一點，釐清不必要的誤解。",
            "建議按現行機制和準則符合選賢任能的原則",
            "根據現行安排，合資格的大律師可申請成為資深大律師，終審法院首席法官可在諮詢大律師公會主席及律師會會長後作出委任。按《法律執業者條例》第31(A)條，委任的準則包括：（一）足夠能力及聲望，對法律有足夠的認識；（二）具有所需的經驗；及（三）執業為訟辯人。律政司提出的建議並沒有改變現行機制和獲委任的準則。我相信大律師公會主席及律師會會長必定會先考慮各申請人是否符合以上準則，才向終審法院首席法官提供公平及坦誠的意見，讓終審法院首席法官考慮。",
            "因此，建議不會改變有關資深大律師的才幹和經驗的資格，符合「選賢任能」的原則。",
            "律政人員的工作包含訟辯與非訟辯職務",
            "律政人員職能與私人執業不同，建議切合律政人員一直以來無分事務律師或大律師的職能。",
            "私人法律專業人員可大致分為兩類：律師（事務律師）及大律師（訟務律師）。然而，在政府工作的律政人員，不論是律師或大律師，均享有出庭發言權，可以在所有級別的法院發言；事實上，律政人員的工作包括法律相關事務與訟務。換言之，本身沒有在香港獲認許為大律師的律政人員也同樣履行訟辯工作，若他們符合《法律執業者條例》第31(A)條的準則，司法及法律界應該一視同仁肯定他們的能力，讓他們可獲委任為資深大律師。大家只須清楚明白律政人員的工作，便不會混淆私人執業的律師與大律師的分別。",
            "建議符合公眾利益",
            "終審法院首席法官在今年的資深大律師委任典禮致辭時指出：「委任權一如諸般公法權力，其行使必須是出於維護和推廣公眾利益的目的。事實上，凸顯資深大律師頭銜之獨特身分和責任的，正是公眾利益…而身負重任意味着社會大眾信賴和期望獲委任人士會善用經驗，發揮所長，盡忠履行委以的重任，藉此為公益服務。」",
            "建議有助鼓勵肩負重要公共職能的律政人員人才，讓表現傑出的律政人員獲得司法及法律界肯定，符合公眾利益。",
            "律政人員離任後的安排",
            "律政司建議在新制度下獲委任為資深大律師的律政人員，他們在離任政府後其資深大律師頭銜將不再適用。",
            "至於私人執業的安排，律政司尊重法律業界的自我監管機制，由相關團體按既定的程序和規例處理。",
            "所有律政人員應享有公平的待遇及權利，只要具備《法律執業者條例》第31A(1)條訂明的資格，無論是律師或大律師的律政人員應同樣可被委任為資深大律師，肯定他們的能力和貢獻。",
