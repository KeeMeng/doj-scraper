            "I am honoured to have been invited to attend the celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China in Beijing. Over the past century, China has marched ahead steadfastly under the leadership of the Party. China has been transformed from feeble to strong, our people have been moving out of poverty to become rich and our society has continued to prosper resulting in extraordinary accomplishments after accumulating valuable experience.",
            "The Opium War marked a turning point in the Chinese history. China was since then reduced to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. Established in 1921, the original aspiration and the mission of the Communist Party of China is to seek happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. The Party also recognises the importance of acting on the people-centred philosophy of development, successfully turning our country gradually from poverty to prosperity. In the fight against poverty, our country has adopted a basic strategy of targeted poverty alleviation, yielding significant achievements. According to the white paper on “Poverty Alleviation: China's Experience and Contribution” published earlier this year, more than 770 million of China's rural population living below the current poverty line have been raised from poverty since reform and opening up, accounting for more than 70% of the global total over the same period according to the World Bank's international poverty standard. China has won the battle against extreme poverty and achieved the poverty alleviation goal set on the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule, earning critical acclaim internationally.",
            "The Communist Party of China leads the nation to overcome obstacles and has developed the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics after the reform and opening up. The amendment to the Constitution was also adopted in 2018, expressly setting out the fundamental system of our country in the Preamble and Article 1. China has realised in just a few decades that took the developed Western countries several centuries on industrialisation, achieving the common goal shared by the Party and the people, as well as making our country stronger and prosper.",
            "At the same time, science and technology in our country have developed rapidly. President Xi Jinping, also the general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, pointed out that “core technologies may not be available when needed, cannot be purchased when needed, and are not always available on demand. Only by grasping key and core technologies within our own hands can we fundamentally guarantee national economic security, national defense security, and other securities.” Our country has successfully enhanced the capacity for independent innovation, allowing the spread of spirit of scientist and patriotism, improving the preparedness in the battle of core technologies.",
            "Under the direction of the Communist Party of China, the Central Authorities put forward the idea “one country, two systems”, which is an innovative constitutional concept, to ensure Hong Kong’s smooth transition and return to the motherland. It also led to successful resolutions of the unequal treaties and the historical Hong Kong question, providing a good example for implementation of the international law. Echoing the preamble of the Basic Law, the aspiration of “one country, two systems” is to uphold the national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, as well as to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.",
            "Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland 24 years ago, our citizens enjoy a safe place to live and work whilst our community has been growing well, ensuring the long-term success of “one country, two systems” with the support of our country.",
            "National security is an issue of top priority for any State in the world. The Central Authorities, in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, authorised the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress to enact the National Security Law to plug the loophole in national security. Hong Kong has reverted to a safe, rational, inclusive and vibrant society which ensures the smooth implementation of the “one country, two systems”.",
            "As pointed out by President Xi, political security is of overarching importance. Top priority has been therefore given to political security in order to maintain the safety of the political system and state power with a view to providing a strong and fundamental political underpinning. “The Decision of the National People’s Congress on improving the electoral system of the HKSAR” was passed to improve the electoral system aiming at a more balanced and orderly political participation as well as a broader representation of society, in a bid to form a new democratic electoral system suited to Hong Kong’s realities and with Hong Kong characteristics. The operation of the Legislative Council (LegCo) will resume normality. The Government and the LegCo are able to put the focus on people’s livelihood and economic development. The principle of “one country, two systems” can be fully and faithfully applied in Hong Kong.",
            "To enhance the understanding and awareness of the national security among the community, the Department of Justice will organise an online legal forum “Security Brings Prosperity” on July 5, bringing together legal experts to discuss and exchange views on the application and interpretation of the National Security Law. You are all welcome to visit the dedicated webpage for registration.",

            "我很榮幸獲邀前往北京出席慶祝中國共產黨成立一百周年的活動。經過了一百年的奮進歷程，在中國共產黨領導下，國家實力由軟弱變堅強，人民生活由貧困變富裕，社會持續發展向前邁進，成就非凡，經驗寶貴。",
            "由鴉片戰爭開始，國家被侵略，淪為半殖民地半封建社會。中國共產黨在1921年成立，初心和使命就是為中國人民謀幸福，為中國民族謀復興，建立了新中國。黨一直堅持以人民為中心的發展思想，令國家從貧窮逐漸走向富強。國家提出的脫貧攻堅戰，精準扶貧戰略，成效顯著。據今年發布的《人類減貧的中國實踐》白皮書，改革開放以來，國家共有7.7億農村貧困人口擺脫貧困；按照世界銀行國際貧困標準，減貧人口佔同期全球減貧人口70%以上；國家提前十年實現《聯合國2030年可持續發展議程》減貧目標，贏得國際讚賞。",
            "中國共產黨帶領全國人民披荊斬棘，經歷改革開放四十年，發展出具中國特色的社會主義制度，並在2018年修改憲法，在序言和第一條清楚明確地把國家的根本制度表述。國家用了幾十年的時間走完了發達國家幾百年走過的工業化歷程，體現了黨和人民的共同目標，讓國家站起來，富起來，強起來。",
            "國家科技事業發展一日千里。習近平總書記指出「關鍵核心技術是要不來、買不來、討不來的。只有把關鍵核心技術掌握在自己手中，才能從根本上保障國家經濟安全，國防安全和其他安全。」我國成功提升自主創新的能力，讓科學家精神及愛國精神得以弘揚，是打好關鍵核心技術攻堅戰的重要體現。",
            "在中國共產黨領導下，中央提出了「一國兩制」的創新憲制概念，讓香港得以平穩過渡，順利回歸，成功處理了不平等公約和歷史遺留下來的問題，同時也為國際法實踐提供了一個典範。正如《基本法》的序言所指，「一國兩制」的初心是為了維護國家主權的統一和領土完整，保持香港的繁榮和穩定。",
            "香港回歸祖國二十四年，有國家作為後盾，市民得以安居樂業，社會得以繁榮發展，「一國兩制」得以行穩致遠。",
            "國家安全本屬國家頭等大事，因此中央按《憲法》和《基本法》透過全國人大常委會制定《香港國安法》，堵塞了香港在維護國家安全的漏洞，使香港回復成為一個安全、理性和包容的社會，令「一國兩制」可以繼續有效運作。",
            "習近平總書記提出「以政治安全為根本」，以及「堅持把政治安全放在首要位置，維護政權安全和制度安全」，為國家安全提供根本政治保證。《全國人民代表大會關於完善香港特別行政區選舉制度的決定》，目標是擴大社會均衡有序的政治參與和更加廣泛的代表性，形成一套符合香港實際情況、有香港特色的新的民主選舉制度。議會將會回復正常運作，政府和議會亦可以共同聚焦處理民生事務，促進經濟發展，「一國兩制」得以全面貫徹落實。",
            "為增進各界對國家安全的了解和認識，律政司將於7月5日以網上形式舉行「國安家好」法律論壇，邀請多位法律專家與學者就《香港國安法》的應用和詮釋進行討論及交流，歡迎大家瀏覽專屬網頁登記觀看。",
