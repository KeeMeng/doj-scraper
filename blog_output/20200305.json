            "Last month, I paid a visit to Yuen Long where I met a few families at Long Shin Estate. Apart from distributing face masks and anti-epidemic supplies to them, I was also given a better understanding of the impact brought by the epidemic on their daily life. To show our concerted support in the fight against the disease, the Department of Justice (DoJ) Staff Club organised a volunteer activity on Sunday which I joined with my fellow colleagues in offering our help to those in need.",
            "To echo the Government’s move to stay united, the DoJ Staff Club put forth a cash contribution campaign to buy anti-epidemic supplies for donation. The Staff Club volunteers acquired face masks and alcohol-based handrub in different ways, some were purchased through online shopping and some were bought at medicine stores. Last Sunday, I joined the volunteers in packing the anti-epidemic supplies, supermarket cash coupons and leaflets with health information. Our volunteers took the “care packs” in person to a non-government organisation a few days ago for passing to the elderly and low income group.",
            "The Staff Club has been participating in volunteer services now and then. Given the overwhelming response this time, I am glad to know that more volunteer activities would be organised in future. I would definitely be joining as many as I could. Through offering our effort to help those in need, we hope to show our care for the less privileged in society, and contribute to building a caring and inclusive community.",
            "The public services of DoJ, like all other government departments, have gradually resumed back to normal. I inspected the Justice Place on Monday to learn more about the infection control measures in place, such as body temperature checking arrangement, provision of hand sanitizers and sanitizing mats at building entrances.",
            "We must remain vigilant as the epidemic is still severe, and more importantly, we also need to stand in solidarity in the fight against the disease.",

            "在二月中的時候，我到訪了元朗朗善邨，向有需要的家庭派發口罩及防疫物資，同時也藉著這個機會了解到疫情對他們生活的影響。剛過去的星期日，律政司職員聯誼會舉辦了一項義工活動，用行動支持社會上下齊心抗疫，我亦有幸可以參與其中。",
            "為響應政府呼籲全社會要團結一致，不分彼此，打贏這場抗疫戰，律政司職員聯誼會早前向各位同事募捐，希望利用善款購買防疫用品轉贈給有需要的人士。聯誼會義工各自從不同途徑購買口罩及酒精搓手液，有部分從網上訂購回來，也有一些是從街上的店舖購買。我聯同一眾義工在星期日將這批防疫物資、超級市場禮券以及健康資訊單張逐一包裝好，再由義工兩天前親自捐贈予一個非政府機構，稍後派發給長者及低收入家庭。",
            "聯誼會過去曾不時組織義工服務，而今次募捐和義工活動的反應十分踴躍，聯誼會日後會繼續舉辦更多關懷社區的活動，我亦一定會盡量參與。律政司的同事和我都希望為社會出一分力，同時亦希望其他人也可以盡量幫助身邊有需要的人共渡難關。",
            "律政司和其他政府部門由星期一起逐步恢復更多的公共服務，我也在當天視察了律政中心，了解律政司為保障同事和公眾所採取的各項預防感染措施，包括在入口處設置體溫檢測儀器、酒精搓手液和消毒地氈等。",
            "現時疫情仍然嚴峻，大家都不能掉以輕心，我亦呼籲社會上下繼續團結一致，同心抗疫。",
