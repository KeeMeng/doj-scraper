            "Our judicial system is highly regarded and internationally recognised. Hong Kong cases are cited in overseas jurisprudence from time to time, which speaks volumes on the confidence of the global legal community in the integrity and quality of Hong Kong’s judicial system. However, it appears that our judicial system has become a target of savage criticisms which are motived by political overtones.",
            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) has reiterated that members of the public have the right to express their views on court decisions and related matters within the boundary permitted by the law. However, unrestrained personal attacks on judges are never tolerated. When the Court of Final Appeal was unjustly accused of giving in to pressure in reaching a decision, the DoJ promptly defended the Judiciary by dismissing such defamatory remarks. When the intimidation against a judicial officer came to light last month, the DoJ also in no time issued a press statement to condemn the violent act.",
            "Judicial independence is the cornerstone of our society. Safeguarding judicial independence is not just the duty of any particular lawyer, but an obligation of every single law-abiding citizen. In my speech delivered at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2018, I said that “[i]t is my duty to ensure that the independence of our Judiciary, as enshrined in the Basic Law, is respected and not arbitrarily attacked or criticised. I urge the community to take the same stance.” In particular the two legal professional bodies, the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong, which are the crucial stakeholders of the legal sector, are duty bound under the “Rules and Regulations” and the “Memorandum of Association” respectively to safeguard our judicial independence.",
            "Since 2019, the Judiciary was under attack on many occasions, be it destruction of court facilities or malicious attacks against the Judiciary. The DoJ spared no efforts to defend the judicial system. When doxxing activities towards judges and other persons involved in the administration of justice were on the rise, as guardian of public interest, I made an application for injunction in October last year to restrain acts of doxxing against judicial officers and their family members. In granting the injunction, the court heavily condemned the conduct of doxxing by saying “what is impermissible is for the public commentary or criticism to descend into personal attacks, or worse still to the public encouragement of the invasion of privacy of, or harassment of, or threats to, or attempted intimidation of Judges or Judicial Officers or their families.”",
            "Any person who acts in violation of an injunction order may be held in contempt of court. Under common law, criminal contempt of court means conduct calculated to interfere with the due administration of justice, and that there must be a real risk that the due administration of justice would be undermined by the relevant conduct. Criminal contempt of court can take many forms. Examples are conduct disrupting court hearings or insulting judicial officers; refusing to be sworn to give evidence when called as a witness in the face of the court; scandalising the court by scurrilous words or conduct against judges; publication of any report which prejudices the fair trial of on-going proceedings; and obstructing the execution of court orders, etc. A common thread which exists in these examples is the real risk of undermining the administration of justice caused by the objectionable conduct. The sanction in criminal contempt is to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice in Hong Kong, and therefore, for the protection of the rule of law. The DoJ would assess each circumstance objectively and carefully to ascertain whether the element of contempt of court is found. In the case of scandalising the court, contemnors found liable can be fined and sentenced to imprisonment.",
            "Individuals from local and overseas communities, from time to time, have been found expressing views on certain ongoing cases. A number of politicians used to irrationally ask for the withdrawal of charges against some defendants and demand for their immediate release, or even launch spiteful comments on personnel who carry out prosecution work. For cases in which the legal proceedings are still underway, it is inappropriate for any of us, not only the DoJ, to comment as it is a matter of sub-judice. Members of the public ought to wait until the court arrives at a decision and they are advised to read the judgment in order to form any objective and informed discussions. Only by carefully reading and correctly understanding court judgments, one would be able to dispel any unwarranted misunderstanding.",

            "香港的司法制度一直備受重視和國際推崇。香港的案例不時在海外的法學研究和討論中獲引用，一再說明國際法律界信任香港健全和高質素的司法制度。但近來我們的司法制度卻因為政治理由而成為攻擊目標。",
            "律政司曾經指出，社會人士有權在法律容許的範圍內就法庭的裁決及相關事項發表意見，但肆意對法官作出人身攻擊，卻絕對不能容忍。當終審法院早前被誣衊屈服於壓力下作出裁決，律政司立即反駁這些惡意中傷司法機構的言論。而當律政司得悉有司法人員遭到恐嚇後，亦隨即發表聲明譴責該等暴行。",
            "司法獨立是社會的基石。維護司法獨立不單是法律人員的職責，更是社會上每一個市民的義務。我在二零一八年法律年度開啟典禮的演辭已提到：「我有責任確保《基本法》明訂的司法獨立受到尊重，不會遭任意攻擊或批評。我籲請社會各界秉持同一立場。」社會上不同人士尤其作為法律界重要持份者的兩個法律專業團體—香港大律師公會和香港律師會，它們分別根據「規章及規則」和「組織章程大綱」，也有責任捍衛司法獨立。",
            "由前年開始，法院設施及司法機構多次受到破壞及惡意攻擊，律政司每次均迅速作出回應，以捍衛司法制度。而針對法官及其他執行司法工作人員的起底活動有上升的趨勢，我作為公眾利益守護者，去年十月向法庭申請禁制令，禁止針對司法人員及其家人的「起底」活動。法庭頒布禁制令的同時，也嚴厲斥責「起底」的行為，指出「絕不容許公眾評論或批評淪為人身攻擊，甚至公開鼓勵侵犯法官或司法人員或其家人的私隱，或對他們作出煩擾、威脅或企圖恐嚇的行為」。",
            "任何違反禁制令的人有機會被視為藐視法庭，普通法所指的刑事藐視法庭，是指蓄意干擾司法工作妥善執行的行為，而相關行為有確實風險會對司法工作的妥善執行構成干擾。藐視法庭包括多種不同的行為：在法庭上作出擾亂聆訊或侮辱司法人員的行為、被法庭傳召為證人的人拒絕宣誓作供、在法庭外發布詆譭法院的言論或作出相關行為、發布影響案件的公平審訊的報道、妨礙執行法院命令等等。以上的例子均有一個共通點，就是那些不妥當的行為對破壞司法公正構成真正的風險。刑事藐視的懲罰就是保持公眾對香港司法制度的信任，從而維護法治。律政司會客觀審慎考慮每宗個案中的行為是否構成以上所指的刑事藐視法庭。以誹謗法院的藐視法庭為例，過往有案件顯示藐視法庭者可被判處罰款及監禁。",
            "我們留意到本港以至海外社會不時有個別人士對一些法庭正在審理的案件發表不當的言論，例如有政客無理地要求我們對被告人撤銷控罪甚至立即釋放，又或者針對履行檢控工作的人員作出不合理的抨擊。而這種情況似乎越來越多。對於司法程序尚在進行的案件，我重申不單止是律政司，社會上所有人均不應肆意發表評論，亦即是「迴避待決案件」(sub-judice)的法律原則。任何人都應該待法庭作出裁決後，先閱讀判辭，才進行客觀和理性的討論，這樣就可以消除大家對法庭裁決的一些不必要誤解。",
