            "Many have made their suggestions to the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in respect of the work by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPCSC) and some made their points or letters public. Last Friday, I noticed one of the bodies representing a branch of the legal profession made some suggestions in an open statement. Yet the proprietary or feasibility of such opinions or suggestions must be viewed in context of the legal and constitutional structure of the HKSAR and with the proper background and understanding of the nature of the Decision and the legislation to be enacted.",
            "Pursuant to the authorisation set out in Article 6 of the Decision passed by the National People’s Congress (NPC) on May 28, the National Security Law is to be enacted by the NPCSC, and after consulting the Basic Law Committee and the Government of the HKSAR, it will be added to Annex III of the Basic Law to be promulgated by the HKSAR and applicable to the HKSAR. It will also be in Annex III and part of the Basic Law of the HKSAR.",
            "The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has two legal systems, the civil law system and the common law system. It is impracticable and unreasonable to expect that everything in a national law, the National Security Law, will be exactly as what a statute in the HKSAR common law jurisdiction would be like. Yet of course, the legislation should be clear and understood in the HKSAR.",
            "As I have stated in many occasions with various media, there are a number of commonalities between the civil and common law systems respectively in the Mainland and the HKSAR, such as retrospectivity, presumption of innocence, burden of proof and standard of proof, legal certainty etc. This point was similarly made with more details on PRC law, by the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Zhang Xiaoming, in his speech on June 8 in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law. His speech and that of the Vice-Chairperson of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Mr Zhang Yong, are available at https://webcast.info.gov.hk/revamp/eng/video/0000000826_mp4.html.",
            "Discussions generated on sunset clause is also interesting. The NPCSC has the power to add or delete from the list of laws in Annex III after consulting the Basic Law Committee and the Government of the HKSAR, and as such there is indeed no need for what has been described as a “sunset clause”. To properly embark on such discussions, it may be useful to remember that the National Security Law to be enacted by the NPCSC is a national legislation providing for the legal framework and enforcement mechanism from a national level. In Article 3 of the Decision of the NPC, it also stated that the HKSAR should as soon as possible complete the legislation that has to be done for national security in accordance with the requirements of the Basic Law. Such legislation to be passed in the HKSAR will be dealing with national security from the perspective of the SAR and may well not be the complete ambit of national security that affects 1.4 billion people.",
            "In summary, the Decision of the NPC and the enactment of the legislation by the NPCSC for inclusion in Annex III of the Basic Law to be promulgated by the HKSAR are premised on constitutional and legal grounds. The circumstances facing Hong Kong and indeed as more clearly evidenced by the uncalled for reactions of some countries really reinforce the need and urgency for the same. Finally, it was stated clearly in the Decision, “safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, upholding and improving the ‘one country, two systems’ regime, maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of Hong Kong residents.” Therefore, the legislation to be enacted for the HKSAR only aims to prevent, curb and sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security, so as to safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and the implementation of \"one country, two systems\".",

            "很多人向中聯辦對全國人大常委會制定國安法條文的工作表達了意見，部分團體亦就此發表公開信。我留意到有其中一個法律團體在上星期五再次發出公開信，當我們嘗試了解它所提出的觀點時，必須要從香港整體的法律及憲制架構來分析，同時亦必須理解《決定》和將會推出的法律條文的背景和性質。",
            "根據全國人大在5月28日通過的《決定》第六條，經徵詢基本法委員會和香港特區政府後，全國人大常委會將這套全國性法律列入《基本法》附件三，由香港特別行政區公布實施適用於香港，同時它亦成為《基本法》附件三的一部分。",
            "中華人民共和國有兩套法律制度：成文法和普通法。對於要求屬全國性法律的國安法的法律條文全部依照香港普通法的法律行文是不合理和不切實際的。但當然法律條文必須行文清晰和明確。",
            "我過去亦曾經解釋，內地成文法制度和香港普通法制度擁有一些相類似的特點，包括追溯力、假定無罪的原則、舉證的責任、證據的標準及法律清晰的要求等。國務院港澳辦副主任張曉明在6月8日的《基本法》頒布三十周年網上研討會上，亦同樣作出說明。大家可以在此（https://webcast.info.gov.hk/revamp/chi/video/0000000826_mp4.html）觀看張曉明副主任和全國人大常務委員會香港特別行政區基本法委員會副主任張勇的發言。",
            "至於有人提出日落條款這個說法，其實全國人大常委會是有權經徵詢基本法委員會和香港特區政府的意見後，對《基本法》附件三的法律作出增減，因此建議設立日落條款實在是多此一舉。如果想正確地進行討論，大家必須緊記全國人大常委會制定的國安法是全國性法律、是從國家層面提出法律框架和執行機制。5月28日所通過的《決定》第三條，強調香港特區應當盡早完成《基本法》規定的維護國家安全立法。在香港通過的法律是處理從特區層面的部分危害國家安全的問題，不一定足以處理影響全國14億人民的國家安全事宜。",
            "總括來說，全國人大5月28日通過《決定》，授權全國人大常委會制定國安法，並列入《基本法》附件三公布實施，完全是基於憲制和法律理據。香港面對的情況，再加上有一些國家就國家安全立法發表不恰當的言論，更加印證有必要就此立法。《決定》明確寫出：“為了維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，堅持和完善『一國兩制』制度體系，維護香港長期繁榮穩定，保障香港居民合法權益。”因此，國安法只是為了防範、制止和懲治極少數危害國家安全的違法分子，以維護香港的繁榮穩定，讓“一國兩制”行穩致遠。",
