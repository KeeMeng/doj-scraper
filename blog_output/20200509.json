            "There have been arrests, prosecutions and convictions of youngsters and students resulting from the social unrest since June last year. Recently, explosives and chemicals were found by the police. It would be catastrophic if they were used for unscrupulous purposes. Some of the youngsters might have been mistakenly led to believe that use of violence should be considered as a means to achieve their aspirations. However, I hope that they appreciate that law-breaking behaviour would always have legal consequences.",
            "It is very troubling to see from the media reports that underage children or students are taking part in unlawful activities and even getting involved in violence. In so doing, they would not only put their own and others' safety at risk, but could also be arrested and prosecuted resulting in criminal records upon convictions. Their future in education and employment would inevitably be affected.",
            "There are misleading suggestions that all young offenders would only be cautioned under the Police Superintendent's Discretion Scheme without criminal records. One must understand that the police, in deliberating whether to administer a caution, have to take into account a number of factors, such as whether the juvenile offender was under the age of 18 at the time of committing the offence; the seriousness and nature of the offence; whether the offender voluntarily and unequivocally admits the offence; whether the offender is remorseful etc. Therefore, the scheme does not apply to all young offenders indiscriminately.",
            "Similarly, bind over orders are only appropriate for first-time offenders involving minor offences and they have to be agreed by the courts. Under the bind over arrangement, offenders are required to admit the wrongdoings and are admonished in an open court. They also need to give an undertaking to the court to be of good behaviour. Imprisonment might be imposed for breaching the undertaking. Before agreeing to such a procedure on specified conditions, the prosecution has to give considerations to various factors including the age of the offender, criminal record, attitude of the offender such as remorsefulness, etc.",
            "There are also comments that prosecutions against young offenders should be withdrawn on the basis of public interest. I have to stress again that the Department of Justice (DoJ) must strictly make our prosecutorial decisions in accordance with admissible evidence, applicable laws and the Prosecution Code. The non-exhaustive list of considerations to be addressed when making assessment in considering public interest, including those applicable to juvenile offenders, were set out in 5.9 and 15.4 of the Prosecution Code, which include the nature of the offence, the seriousness of the offence, the criminal history of the suspect, remorsefulness of the suspect and the sentencing options available to the court, etc. Prosecutors should follow the above principles in making their decisions and must not withdraw charges unjustifiably under the pretext of public interest.",
            "In considering the above arrangements, the DoJ has to carefully examine the circumstances of each case in an objective manner and strictly in accordance with the established principles. A decision cannot be made solely based on the age of the offenders. Their legal representatives are not only duty bound to inform them of their rights but also have an obligation to remind them of the legal consequences and the availability and considerations in relation to the above arrangements.",
            "As observed by Lord Diplock, \"[t]he acceptance of the rule of law as a constitutional principle requires that a citizen, before committing himself to any course of action, should be able to know in advance what are the legal consequences that will flow from it\". Every member of the public must be aware that one has to bear the legal responsibility resulting from law-breaking behaviour. I sincerely hope that every one, in particular the youngsters, should exercise their independent thinking and judgement, and, more importantly, stay away from violence and not commit mistakes that might ruin their lives in the future.",

            "在過去大半年發生的社會動盪，有不少人涉嫌觸犯不同的罪行被拘捕、檢控和定罪，當中包括有年輕人和學生。最近警方搜獲一批爆炸品和化學品，假如被不法分子利用，後果實在不堪設想。或許有人誤以為使用暴力手段是可以達成目的，但我希望他們明白，任何違法的行為，最終都會帶來法律後果。",
            "大家從媒體的報道，都會知悉有一些未成年的青少年或學生有份參與違法活動，有些甚至乎作出暴力行徑，這種情況確實令人擔憂，他們除了有機會危及自己或別人的人身安全外，更會被拘捕和檢控，一旦罪名成立，就會留有案底，必定影響他們日後升學及就業的前途。",
            "有些人誤以為年輕人犯罪只會被警司警誡，不會留有案底，但其實警方在衡量是否施行警司警誡時，是需要詳細考慮多項因素，包括：他們在犯案時是否仍然未成年（18歲以下）、所干犯罪行的嚴重性、是否自願及明確地認罪，以及是否有悔意等。因此，並非所有犯案的青少年均符合警司警誡的條件。",
            "此外，簽保守行為這項安排亦經常被人提及，但其實這命令只適用於初犯者及輕微罪行的個案，而且須由法庭批准，犯罪者需要在公開聆訊中承認所犯過錯和接受告誡，然後向法庭承諾守行為。法庭若其後發現他們不遵從簽保令，是有權判處他們監禁作為懲處的。而且，控方決定是否接納簽保守行為時，亦必須考慮一系列的因素，包括：犯罪者的年齡、犯罪紀錄、犯罪者對有關罪行的態度，例如是否願意悔改等。",
            "對於有意見認為律政司應該以公眾利益這個因素，向年青的犯案者撤銷控罪，我必須強調，律政司一直都是嚴格按照證據、適用法律和《檢控守則》作出每一個檢控決定。《檢控守則》（第5.9和15.4段）已列明檢控人員在處理涉及少年犯的案件時須就公眾利益所考慮的因素，包括罪行的性質、嚴重程度、犯案者過往的犯罪紀錄、有否與執法機關合作或表現悔意及可供法庭選擇的判處刑罰等。律政司必須按既定程序處理檢控事宜，檢控人員不能隨意動用公眾利益作為撤銷控罪的理據。",
            "律政司在考慮使用以上處理案件的方法時，都必定要根據每一宗案件的案情仔細客觀分析，再按相關原則作出決定，絕不能單靠犯案者的年齡這一項因素。所有犯案者的法律代表除了有責任告訴他們的法律權利外，同時亦有責任提醒他們所面對的法律後果和以上各項安排的考慮因素。",
            "正如迪普洛克大法官（Lord Diplock）指出：“接納法治作為憲法原則，要求公民在採取任何行動前都應該能事先知悉隨之而來的法律後果”。任何人用違法行為來達成目的，他同時亦必須要預備承受法律責任，因此我希望大家，特別是年輕的一輩，要建立獨立思考和判斷能力，凡事三思而行，不應隨便以身試法，因為一個錯誤的決定是足以摧毀一生。",
