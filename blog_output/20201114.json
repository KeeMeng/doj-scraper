            "The Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) on the Continuing Discharge of Duties by the Sixth Term Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) (811 Decision) provides that the sixth-term LegCo of the HKSAR is to continue to discharge duties for not less than one year to address the lacuna in the legislature, which is a constitutional issue, caused by the postponement of the election by the HKSAR Government. However, it only dealt with the continuing discharge of duties by the legislature. The NPCSC made a Decision on the qualification of members of the LegCo of the HKSAR (Decision) on Wednesday. The HKSAR Government immediately announced the disqualification of four members of the sixth-term LegCo in accordance with the Decision.",
            "The NPCSC’s Decision has solid legal basis, which can be summarised in four points. Firstly, it is made in pursuant to the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Articles 52 and 54 respectively stipulate that “it is the duty of citizens of the People’s Republic of China to safeguard the unification of the country and the unity of all itsnationalities”, and “it is the duty of citizens of the People’s Republic of China to safeguard the security, honor and interests of the motherland; they must not commit acts detrimental to the security, honor or interests of the motherland” while Article 67(1) sets out that the NPCSC shall exercise the functions and powers “to interpret the Constitution and supervise its enforcement”. The NPCSC has the duty to maintain the constitutional order of the HKSAR and to ensure that members of LegCo, who continued to discharge their duties in the sixth-term LegCo, must be in compliance with the legal requirements and preconditions for taking up the post of a LegCo member by upholding the Basic Law and pledging allegiance to the HKSAR of the PRC.",
            "Secondly, according to the Decision on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the HKSAR to safeguard national security by the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Hong Kong National Security Law, it safeguards the systems under “One Country, Two Systems” from the perspective of national security. If people advocate or support \"Hong Kong independence\", refuse to recognise the PRC's sovereignty over Hong Kong and the exercise of the sovereignty, solicit intervention by foreign or external forces in the HKSAR's affairs, or carry out other activities endangering national security, they could not genuinely uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the HKSAR of the PRC. They could neither fulfil the legal requirements and conditions for a LegCo member nor have the qualifications of a LegCo member.",
            "Thirdly, it is made in accordance with the legal requirements and preconditions in respect of taking up the post of a LegCo member under Article 1 and the provision that any conduct in breach of the oath after the oath taking shall bear legal responsibility in accordance with law under Article 3 of the Interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the PRC by the NPCSC (Interpretation of Article 104) in 2016. Article 1 of the Interpretation of Article 104 states that “to uphold the Basic Law and to bear allegiance to the HKSAR of the PRC” are not only the legal content which must be included in the oath but also the legal requirements and preconditions for standing for election in respect of or taking up the public office. At the same, the first paragraph of the Decision sets out the conducts which are in breach of the oath. When the member is so decided in accordance with law, he or she is immediately disqualified from being a LegCo member.",
            "Lastly, the 811 Decision provides for the legal basis for LegCo members to continue discharging their duties in the sixth-term LegCo. Under such a special circumstance, the NPCSC has a constitutional duty to handle the issue concerning the qualification of LegCo members arising from the continuing discharge of duties by the LegCo, in particular whether they are in compliance with the legal requirements and preconditions of upholding the Basic Law and pledging allegiance to the HKSAR of the PRC. As the nominations of the four persons in question had been invalidated by Returning Officers in accordance with the Legislative Council Ordinance when they applied to participate in the LegCo election of the seventh-term, they were not qualified for taking part in the LegCo election and are naturally unable to be LegCo members. Therefore, the NPCSC passed a motion to decide that members of the sixth-term LegCo whose nominations were decided to be invalid in accordance with law by the HKSAR (including invalidation of nomination by Returning Officer under the Legislative Council Ordinance), he or she is immediately disqualified from being a LegCo member. The disqualification of LegCo members was therefore announced by the HKSAR Government according to the Decision.",
            "Indeed, if we think hard, it is not difficult to understand that but for the special circumstances this year: the 811 Decision by the NPCSC was required to address the continuing discharge of duties by the LegCo caused by the postponement of the election, and that the Governmenthas not completed the exercise of the relevant local legislation on the Interpretation of Article 104, the four persons, whose nominations were invalidated, could not take part in the original LegCo election, and needless to say they could not take up the office as a LegCo member. The HKSAR Government had to request the Central Authorities to invite the NPCSC to make a decision on this special constitutional issue.",
            "We should all bear in mind that China is a unitary state and power comes from the Central Authorities. Constitutional matters are ought to be handled by the NPC or NPCSC in accordance with the Constitution. Its legal decisions or instruments can provide legal basis with binding effect.",
            "The Interpretation of Article 104 clearly states that oath takers must uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the HKSAR of the PRC, adding that oath taker, who engages in conduct in breach of the oath, shall bear legal responsibility in accordance with law. These are already reflected in the first and third provisions of the Decision. Since the Interpretation of Article 104 has been made, the HKSAR Government endeavours to expedite the legislative procedure for local legislation which is fully supported by the Department of Justice. The HKSAR Government is determined to correctly fulfil its relevant constitutional duty.",

            "根據《全國人民代表大會常務委員會關於香港特別行政區第六屆立法會繼續履行職責的決定》（《811決定》），「第六屆立法會繼續履行職責，不少於一年」，解決特區政府押後選舉而令立法機關出現空缺的憲制問題，但必須注意這只是處理立法機關繼續履行職責事宜。全國人民代表大會常務委員會（全國人大常委會）在星期三就香港特區立法會議員資格問題作出了決定，特區政府隨即根據相關決定宣布四位第六屆立法會議員即時喪失立法會議員的資格。",
            "全國人大常委會作出的決定具備了穩固的法律基礎，可以歸納為四點。首先是按《中華人民共和國憲法》（《憲法》），根據第五十二條「中華人民共和國公民有維護國家統一和全國各民族團結的義務」、第五十四條「中華人民共和國公民有維護祖國的安全、榮譽和利益的義務，不得有危害祖國的安全、榮譽和利益的行為」以及第六十七條第一項全國人大常委會「解釋憲法，監督憲法的實施」的規定作出。全國人大常委有責任維護特區的憲制秩序，必須確保延任第六屆立法會的議員符合出任立法會議員的法定要求和條件，即擁護《基本法》和效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區。",
            "第二是根據《全國人民代表大會關於建立健全香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的決定》和《香港國安法》，從國家安全的層面來維護「一國兩制」的體系。一些因宣揚或者支持「港獨」主張、拒絕承認國家對香港擁有並行使主權、尋求外國或者境外勢力干預香港特別行政區事務，或者具有其他危害國家安全等行為的人士，根本不可能真誠地擁護《基本法》和效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區，沒有符合出任立法會議員的法定要求和條件，沒有出任立法會議員的資格。",
            "第三是依據二零一六年《全國人民代表大會常務委員會關於〈中華人民共和國香港特別行政區基本法〉第一百零四條的解釋》（《第一百零四條解釋》）第一條關於出任議員的法定要求和條件，第三條所指的宣誓之後從事違反宣誓行為的，依法承擔法律責任的規定作出了決定。《第一百零四條解釋》第一條規定「擁護中華人民共和國香港特別行政區基本法，效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區」，既是宣誓必須包含的法定內容，也是參選或出任公職的法定要求和條件。同時，全國人大常委會今次作出的決定第一段列出屬於違反誓言的行為，一經依法認定，必須承擔法律責任，即時喪失議員的資格。",
            "最後，議員延任第六屆立法會的法律依據來自《811決定》，在這特殊的情況下，全國人大常委會亦有憲制責任處理立法會繼續履行職責而引發起議員的資格問題，尤其是他們是否符合擁護《基本法》和效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區的法定要求和條件。由於該四人早前報名參加第七屆立法會選舉時，已經被選舉主任根據《立法會條例》裁定他們的提名無效，亦不具備參選立法會的資格，自然也無法出任議員。因此，全國人大常委會通過議案，決定被裁定提名無效的第六屆立法會議員，一經依法認定（包括選舉主任根據《立法會條例》所作的裁定），即時喪失立法會議員的資格，所以特區政府根據決定隨即作出相關宣布。",
            "其實大家只要細心想想，若然不是今年出現了一個特殊情況：因押後選舉而令立法機關出現繼續履行職責事宜而需由全國人大常委會作出《811決定》，加上特區政府未有對《第一百零四條解釋》進行相關的本地立法，該四人已經在原定立法會選舉被裁定提名無效，根本不能參加原定的立法會選舉，更談不上出任立法會議員。因此，特區政府面對這個特殊的憲制秩序的問題，向中央提出請求，提請全國人大常委會作出決定。",
            "大家亦必須緊記，中國是單一體制的國家，權力來自中央。當需要處理涉及憲制的問題時，理所當然是由全國人大或全國人大常委會根據《憲法》行使權力，作出法律決定或制定法律文書，提供具約束力的法律基礎。",
            "《第一百零四條解釋》，明確規定必須擁護《基本法》和效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區，以及指出宣誓人在宣誓之後從事違反誓言行為的，依法承擔法律責任，這已經反映了在今次決定的第一及第三點內。自全國人大常委會作出《第一百零四條解釋》後，特區政府已在處理本地立法工作，律政司亦一直積極配合，務求令特區政府可以更準確履行憲制責任。",
