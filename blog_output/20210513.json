            "To buttress Hong Kong’s position as a leading international legal and dispute resolution services centre, young legal professionals have to be equipped with international legal knowledge and have an international perspective.",
            "Further to my discussions with the Secretary-General of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), Professor Ignacio Tirado, during his visit to Hong Kong for the 3rd UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit in November 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding with UNIDROIT was signed yesterday for seconding young legal professionals (both public and private sectors) to the Secretariat of UNIDROIT in Rome, Italy. This is yet another valuable secondment opportunity that the DoJ has secured with renowned international organizations.",
            "UNIDROIT is an independent inter-governmental institute that works on modernizing, harmonizing and co-ordinating private and in particular commercial law between States and groups of States. It also formulates uniform law instruments, principles and rules for such purposes in areas like security interests, capital markets, commercial contracts, international sales, and civil procedure. It is noteworthy that UNIDROIT has been focusing on new and challenging legal issues like digital assets and private law.",
            "Apart from UNIDROIT, the DoJ has reached a similar standing arrangement with the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) last December in which lawyers from both the private and public sectors who are Hong Kong permanent residents could apply for a secondment.",
            "The DoJ has also been working closely with UNCITRAL on different aspects. Arrangements have been put in place for young legal officers to take part in the Junior Professional Officers Programme of the UNCITRAL. More recently, with the support of UNCITRAL, the DoJ has set up the Inclusive Global Legal Innovation Platform on ODR (iGLIP on ODR) to explore international developments on ODR.",
            "I am most grateful to the Central People’s Government and UNIDROIT for their support to this arrangement. Through participating in this programme, our young lawyers will gain knowledge of the operation of international organisations, broaden their horizons through learning from international law experts from various jurisdictions and participate in the development of international law.",
            "Successful applicants will spend six to 12 months at UNIDROIT in Rome, and for secondees from the private sector, a monthly allowance of HK$50,000 will be provided via UNIDROIT. Those who are interested in the secondment programme are encouraged to visit our dedicated webpage for further details and application. The programme is open to applications for one month from May 20 to June 19. I hope the professionals will seize the opportunity to apply for secondment. The experience and exposure will be invaluable to the individual, the chambers or the law firms, and to Hong Kong as a whole.",

            "為鞏固香港作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的領導地位，年輕的法律專業人士應具備國際法律知識及國際視野。",
            "早於二零一九年十一月，當國際統一私法協會（私法協會）秘書長Ignacio Tirado教授來港出席第三屆聯合國國際貿易法委員會（貿法委）亞太司法會議時，我與他已經就借調本地法律專業人士（包括私人執業、在政府或公營機構工作）前往意大利羅馬私法協會秘書處的安排進行磋商，昨日終於正式簽訂諒解備忘錄。我很高興律政司再次與國際著名機構落實借調計劃，為法律人員提供非常難得的機會。",
            "私法協會作為政府之間的獨立組織，致力現代化、協調和統一國家與國家集團之間的私法，尤其是商事法。該會並為此在擔保權益、資本市場、商業合同、國際銷售和民事訴訟等領域制定了統一的法律文書、原則和規則。值得注意的是，私法協會一直專注於處理全新和具挑戰性的法律問題，例如數碼資產法和私法。",
            "除了私法協會，律政司去年十二月和海牙國際私法會議（海牙會議）達成相若的恆常安排。具香港永久居民身份的本地律師，不論是私人執業，還是在政府或公營機構工作，均可申請參加借調計劃。",
            "律政司亦與聯合國貿法委在不同範疇緊密合作，年輕的法律人員獲得參與貿法委初級專業人員計劃的機會；最近，律政司在貿法委的支持下，設立「普惠全球法律創新平台」，研究有關網上爭議解決的議題。",
            "我衷心感謝中央政府及私法協會對這項安排的鼎力支持，令參加這項計劃的年輕律師得以加深對國際組織運作的認識，向不同司法管轄區的國際法律專家學習和增廣見聞，並參與國際法的發展。",
            "成功申請者將會在位於羅馬的私法協會工作六至十二個月，而參加計劃的私人執業律師，會透過私法協會每月獲得港幣50,000元津貼。有興趣者歡迎瀏覽我們的專頁，了解計劃詳情及報名參加，借調計劃將於五月二十日至六月十九日接受報名，為期一個月。我希望年輕的律師把握機會報名參加，工作所得的經驗和接觸都是難能可貴，對於個人、大律師辦事處、律師事務所，以至整個香港來說，帶來莫大的禆益。",
