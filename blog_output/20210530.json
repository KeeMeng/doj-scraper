            "The Improving Electoral System (Consolidated Amendments) Bill 2021 was passed in the Legislative Council (LegCo) on Thursday. The amendment to the ordinance was made in accordance with the Decision of the National People's Congress (NPC) on Improving the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the amended Annex I and Annex II to the Basic Law with a view to fully implementing “patriots administering Hong Kong” and safeguarding the overall interests of society and the constitutional order as set out in the Constitution and the Basic Law. This would synthesise a new democratic electoral system suited to Hong Kong’s actual situation and with Hong Kong characteristics.",
            "When improving the electoral system of a place, one would take into account the historical background, cultural diversity, political thoughts, and inevitably the historical and current state of political development and the actual circumstances there. The Standing Committee (SC) of the NPC, in deliberating the amendments to Annexes I and II to the Basic Law, has already taken into consideration the actual situation in Hong Kong. Certain overseas politicians alleged again that the legislation “defies” the objective of universal suffrage as set out in the Basic Law. However, it should be pointed out that the ultimate aim of universal suffrage, to be achieved in light of the actual situation in Hong Kong and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly process, as specified in Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law, remains unchanged.",
            "The NPCSC adopted the amended Annex I and Annex II to the Basic Law on March 30. Since then, my colleagues and I have met with various organisations and individuals from the legal and dispute resolution sector to explain to them the improvements to the electoral system. At the Bills Committee meetings, the Government categorised the policy with the related main ordinance and subsidiary legislations, which offered LegCo members a good grasp of the content and its implementation in the course of scrutiny.",
            "The Election Committee is now entrusted with two new functions: (1) electing 40 legislators, and (2) nominating candidates for the LegCo election. These are two important aspects of the electoral system. Through the reconstituted Election Committee, the balanced and orderly political participation of the Hong Kong community is enhanced and broader representation is ensured. As such, the Election Committee is like the ballast of the new democratic electoral system, ensuring the overall interests of society, so as to fully and faithfully implement the policy of “one country, two systems”.",
            "The newly established Candidate Eligibility Review Committee will be responsible for assessing and validating the eligibility of candidates for the Election Committee members, the Chief Executive and the LegCo members, ensuring their qualifications are in conformity with the Basic Law, the Hong Kong National Security Law, NPCSC’s interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law, the Decision by the NPCSC on the qualification of the HKSAR LegCo members, and provisions of relevant local laws, which fully reflect the implementation of “patriots administering Hong Kong”.",
            "The improvements to the electoral system should bring an end to the chaotic scenes at the LegCo. Radicals with anti-Chinese sentiment and those who attempted to collude with external forces to meddle in Hong Kong’s affairs are less likely to enter the political structure through elections. The operation of the LegCo will resume normality. People who are devoted to serving the community will be able to participate in policy discussions in a rational and objective manner and offer constructive suggestions to the Government.",
            "Last but not least, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to colleagues who participated in the local legislation for their full support to the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau. To ensure that the three coming elections can be held as scheduled, the DoJ will continue to work closely with other government departments for the preparatory work.",

            "立法會在星期四通過《2021年完善選舉制度 (綜合修訂)條例草案》，這次修例依照《全國人民代表大會關於完善香港特別行政區選舉制度的決定》和修改後的《基本法》附件一及附件二而提出，目的是確保落實「愛國者治港」和保障社會整體利益，有效維護《憲法》和《基本法》確立的憲制秩序，構建一套符合香港實際情況，有香港特色的新的民主選舉制度。",
            "要完善一個地方的選舉制度，必然會先考慮當地的歷史背景、社會上的多元文化、政治思維，當然不能缺少當地的政制發展歷史和現狀及實際情況。全國人大常委會修改《基本法》附件一及附件二時，已考慮香港的實際情況。有一些海外政客又聲稱修例違背《基本法》所列明的普選目標，但其實《基本法》第四十五條和第六十八條規定根據香港的實際情況和循序漸進的原則達至普選的目標依然保持不變。",
            "自全國人大常委會在三月三十日公布經修訂的《基本法》附件一和附件二後，我及律政司的同事已經與不同的法律及爭議解決業界團體和個別人士會面，向他們講解完善選舉制度的安排。進行本地立法時，政府將相關的政策與主體條例和附屬法例歸納一起，方便向議員講解，也讓他們更易掌握內容，了解政策如何具體落實。",
            "選舉委員會現時獲賦予兩項新職能：(一)產生四十名立法會議員；（二）負責提名立法會候選人。這兩項職能都是選舉制度中的重要元素，通過選舉委員會擴大香港社會均衡有序的政治參與，讓它更具廣泛的代表性。因此選舉委員會無疑就似是一艘船的壓艙物，確保社會整體利益受保障，讓「一國兩制」得以全面貫徹落實。",
            "至於新設立的候選人資格審查委員會，負責審查和確認選舉委員會委員候選人、行政長官候選人和立法會議員候選人的資格，確保候選人資格符合《基本法》、《香港國安法》、全國人大常委會就《基本法》第一百零四條的解釋和《關於香港特別行政區立法會議員資格問題的決定》以及本地相關法律的規定，充分體現「愛國者治港」的原則。",
            "完善選舉制度後，過去在立法會出現的亂象應該不會再發生，反中亂港勢力和企圖勾結外部勢力干預香港內部事務的違法分子不會再輕易透過選舉進入政治體制，議會將可以回復正常運作，讓有志服務社會的人可以客觀理性地參與政策討論，向政府提出有建設性的意見。",
            "最後，我必須向參與這項立法工作的律政司的同事致以衷心謝意，他們不辭勞苦，全面配合政制及內地事務局處理相關的本地立法工作。為確保即將進行的三場選舉可以如期進行，律政司會繼續與其他政府部門緊密合作，做好籌備工作。",
