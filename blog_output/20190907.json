            "The controversies and disputes over the past few months have unfortunately led to escalating violence. Clashes between the Police and the public became more frequent. The Chief Executive announced that a platform for dialogue with people from all walks of life would be established with a view to finding a way out for Hong Kong.",
            "Since July, I met with two legal professional bodies and also legal practitioners to gauge their views on various issues. Last Friday, I attended a seminar organised by the Legal Affairs Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association. The seminar, which was held in response to the appeal by the Chief Executive to start dialogue platforms, was joined by over 140 legal professionals who offered insights to the recent problems in Hong Kong.",
            "At the seminar, I gave a very short introduction at the beginning to leave more time to listen to the opinions expressed by the participants. The discussion included the work of Independent Police Complaints Council, legal aid scheme, the impact on the business environment and provision of legal services, the development of small and medium sized law firms and young legal practitioners. While some shared similar views with the government, some held differently.",
            "I also shared my views on resolving disputes through mediation with the participants. A mediator, in the process of mediation, has to remain neutral and listen to the views as well as grievances from all parties. A consensus can be reached only after their grievance is voiced out. Over the years, the technique of mediation has helped resolve a number of disputes such as the agreement on the minimum wage in 2010. Also, the Financial Dispute Resolution Centre Limited was established in 2011 to handle disputes through a “mediation first, arbitration next” approach after the outbreak of the minibonds incident.",
            "Experience from mediation showed that narrowing differences is essential in reaching a consensus. There are still diverse views in the society and some people are not willing to make any compromise. But I believe that we all love Hong Kong. With this in mind, we can find a way to reconcile our differences through a constructive dialogue and move forward together.",

            "過去幾個月社會上的紛爭仍然持續不斷，暴力破壞的行為越趨激烈，警民衝突頻生，行政長官已表示會構建對話平台，為香港尋找出路。",
            "我自七月開始，已經與兩個法律專業團體和不同的法律界人士會面，細心聆聽他們對現時社會問題的看法。上周五，我出席了由香港中國企業協會轄下法律專業委員會舉辦的一場研討會，共有一百四十多位法律界人士參加。這場研討會正是響應行政長官的呼籲，在民間構建一個對話平台，主辦單位藉此讓法律專業人士就現時社會上的問題向政府提出建設性的意見。",
            "在會議上，我作了一個簡短的開場發言，之後便一直用心聽取與會者的意見，他們探討了多個議題，包括監警會的工作範圍、法律援助計劃、近期事件對營商環境及法律服務的影響、中小型律師事務所及年輕律師的發展等。當中的看法有些與政府立場接近，但亦有些與政府持相反意見。",
            "我也在研討會上分享了調解對解決爭議的看法，一名中立的調解員，除了要聆聽不同的意見外，亦要聆聽各方的憤怒，讓他們表達了不滿的情緒後，才有機會尋找共通點化解矛盾。政府在過往曾經運用調解的技巧來解決紛爭，包括在二〇一〇年促成勞資雙方就最低工資的金額達成共識。而十多年前因迷你債券事件，政府最終於二〇一一年成立金融糾紛調解中心，就是以“先調解，後仲裁”的概念來解決糾紛。",
            "調解的經驗說明大家要放下分歧才可以解決問題。現時社會上仍然有人持不同意見，亦有人表明不肯讓步，但我相信大家都懷著一顆愛香港這個家的心，在這個大前提下，不如大家放下成見，透過對話，互相諒解，一起向前邁進。",
