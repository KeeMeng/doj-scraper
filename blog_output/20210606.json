            "The advantages of mediation include the preservation of relationships and creating a solution that will be beneficial to both sides, resulting in a win-win situation. Timing is also of the essence. The earlier mediation is conducted, before views get entrenched, the more likely it is for reaching an amicable settlement, thereby preventing differences from getting into a dispute that might end up in court or arbitration. It is for that reason that the Department of Justice (DoJ) has been promoting the “Mediate First” Pledge since 2009 and now with some 700 pledgees from around the world. Being a brand of Hong Kong, “Mediate First” events have been conducted in Shanghai, Shenzhen, etc, and on May 28, we held the “Mediate First, Anchoring the Future” webinar, which discussed three areas in which mediation has a pivotal role in avoiding and resolving differences.",
            "Using mediation in resolving disputes in private wealth and asset management is a relatively new area. Family offices and wealth management services have grown exponentially in Hong Kong, usually involving family wealth being managed for family purposes. If and when disputes arise between members of the family, trustees and beneficiaries, it is much more sensible for mediation to be used as an amicable and confidential resolution mechanism, where each family member can voice out their underlying issues and concerns in the process. Family members from different generations can acknowledge the views and needs of each other and work out a mutually agreeable roadmap together. Resolving disputes amicably lays a solid foundation for the smooth operation of the family business in the long run.",
            "Mediation techniques are in particular suitable for clinical services in order to avoid disputes. The feelings and emotions experienced by healthcare practitioners, patients and their family in the clinical setting may easily cause conflicts or misunderstandings. By using mediation skills, mutual understanding and communication will be enhanced. Disputes between medical staff and patients can also be resolved through a third party by means of mediation. Further, the Apology Ordinance, which came into effect in 2017, allows medical practitioners to express their sympathies or apologies to patients without concerns of admitting liabilities on their part. This helps prevent medical disputes from escalating.",
            "Additionally, mediation plays a key role in resolving employees’ compensation claims. It can address the disputes involving work injuries in a more humane and sensitive manner, thereby preserving the employer-employee relationship whilst saving costs and time as compared to litigating the claim. The Legal Aid Department is supportive of the use of mediation in legally aided cases, and seeing that mediation can assist all parties to reach a mutually agreeable outcome, we will continue our efforts to promote “Mediate First” in this area.",
            "Last but not least, I would like to extend my congratulations to the 34 “Mediate First Pledge Star Logo” awardees for their active involvement in this meaningful campaign. As we have covered how to “Unlock the Potentials” of mediation in the “Mediate First” Pledge event in 2019, we hope that the event this year can “Anchor the Future” and set the scene for the rapid development of mediation. We will continue to roll out various initiatives to capitalise on the benefits and advantages that mediation can bring to the table.",

            "採用調解處理糾紛有很多好處，包括為雙方維持良好關係，有利創造解決方案，帶來雙贏局面。時機亦同樣重要，在分歧變得不可挽回前盡早進行調解，達成和解的機會越大，也可防止分歧化成爭端而最終需要在法庭進行訴訟或以仲裁解決。正是這個原因，律政司自2009年起一直推動「調解為先」承諾活動，至今已有來自世界各地逾700人簽署「調解為先」承諾書。活動亦逐漸變成香港的一個品牌，我們曾經在上海、深圳等地舉辦「調解為先」承諾活動。今年在5月28日舉辦的「調解為先立足未來」網上研討會，專注討論調解在避免及解決糾紛中發揮關鍵作用的三個範疇。",
            "在研討會的第一個環節，我們探討了在一個相對較新的服務領域中使用調解，就是私人財富和資產管理。這類家族辦公室和財富管理服務在香港大幅增加，通常都是管理家族財產。一旦家族成員、受託人或受益人之間出現糾紛，通過調解以和諧及保密的方式處理較為明智。在調解的過程中，每一位家族成員可以坦誠說出最根本的問題和關注，令不同年代的成員都能尊重彼此的想法和需要，就未來路向達成共識。和平地解決家族糾紛，將為家族業務的長遠發展奠下基礎。",
            "調解技巧特別適用於臨床醫療服務，避免產生糾紛，醫護人員與病人及其家屬，在醫療期間都會有不同感受和出現情緒變化，容易在溝通上產生磨擦或誤解，醫護人員可以利用調解技巧增進雙方的理解和溝通。而醫護與病人之間的糾紛，也可透過第三方調解，從而避免訴訟。再者。在2017年生效的《道歉條例》，為醫護人員提供了空間，向患者表達同情或歉意，而無需擔心構成承認法律責任，有助在糾紛初期防止事態惡化。",
            "調解還可以在僱員補償索償事宜中發揮關鍵作用。在涉及工傷的糾紛中，調解可以更細心及人性化地處理問題，保持良好的勞資關係，同時節省時間和訴訟成本，法律援助署亦支持在法援案件中使用調解。有鑑於調解可以協助各方達成共同接受的方案，我們將努力在這個範疇繼續推廣「調解為先」。",
            "最後，我藉著這個機會，恭喜34位獲頒星徽獎項的承諾人，感謝他們積極參與這項意義深遠的活動。2019年的「調解為先」承諾書活動，將調解的「潛能盡展」，我們期望今年的活動可以為調解的迅速發展訂下基調，作好「立足未來」的準備。律政司會繼續推出措施，發揮調解帶來的效益和優勢。",
