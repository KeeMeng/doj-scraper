            "I led a delegation comprising Hong Kong legal and dispute resolution professionals to Shanghai earlier to meet with representatives from the China Shipowners' Association and China Classification Society Shanghai Branch to promote our maritime arbitration services.",
            "Many of you may already be familiar with Hong Kong's advantages in arbitration services. As we are one of the busiest ports in the world, maritime legal services have become an integral part of Hong Kong. We have a broad pool of legal practitioners to provide high-end maritime law and arbitration services to shippers, ship owners and commodities owners in aspects such as ship financing, ship broking, ship building and maritime insurance. We are striving to develop our maritime arbitration.",
            "The Hong Kong Maritime Arbitration Group is exploring ways to update arbitration rules and small claims procedures. Its work is close to completion. With these measures, I hope that more Mainland shipping enterprises would choose Hong Kong as an arbitration venue.",
            "Separately, we spare no effort in promoting the “Mediate First” Pledge event, a brand which was built up by the Department of Justice, outside Hong Kong. The first inaugural event was held in Shanghai. Around 170 participants from different enterprises as well as the legal and mediation sectors attended the event, among which approximately 80 enterprises or individuals made the “Mediate First” Pledge and agreed to first explore the use of mediation when disputes arise. We will continue to introduce this event to other places and let more overseas enterprises know about it in order to further enhance the development of mediation.",
            "In fact, mediation by a neutral mediator could be a feasible means to break the current stalemate in the society. Although an immediate resolution might not be possible, the process of mediation provides a communication platform which enables us to narrow our differences or review our circumstances, thereby paving the way for further negotiation with a view to reaching an ultimate settlement. \"Treasure Hong Kong, our home\".",

            "我早前聯同一班香港法律及爭議解決業界人士到訪上海，與中國船東協會理事會及中國船級社上海分社的代表會面，推廣香港的海事仲裁服務。",
            "香港在仲裁方面的優勢，大家都耳熟能詳，而香港作為全球最繁忙的港口之一，海事法律服務方面更是不可或缺的一環。無論在船舶融資、船舶買賣、造船、海事保險等，香港的律師都能夠為船東、租船人及貨主提供高端的海商事法律及仲裁服務。我們現時正努力進一步發展專業的海事仲裁。",
            "香港海事仲裁協會就如何更新仲裁規則及小額索賠程序的工作已接近完成，我們希望可以吸引多些內地航運企業在香港進行仲裁。",
            "另外，律政司一直致力建立“調解為先”作為香港的一個品牌，並不遺餘力向香港以外的地方推廣。首個在香港以外舉辦的“調解為先”承諾書系列活動已於上海完滿結束。活動吸引了大概一百七十位來自不同企業、法律及調解業界的參與者，當中有約八十位企業或個人作出了“調解為先”承諾，承諾有爭議時會先探索採用調解解決爭議。律政司會繼續在其他地方推介“調解為先”承諾書活動，讓更多海外企業和人士認識這項活動，藉此進一步促進調解的發展。",
            "面對香港現時的困局，利用中立調解員進行調解未嘗不是一個好的選擇，雖然調解未必能即時成功解決雙方的爭議，但在過程中提供了一個溝通平台，有利雙方收窄分歧，或重新檢視自己的處境，有助日後繼續磋商以達致最終和解。“珍惜香港這個家”。",
