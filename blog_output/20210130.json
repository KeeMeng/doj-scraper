            "The United Kingdom (UK) government announced the opening of a new visa for Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status holders. A correct comprehension of the Sino-British Joint Declaration (Joint Declaration) will allow one to understand that there is no single clause which provides for British rights or obligations to Hong Kong after the city's reunification with the Motherland.",
            "On July 12, 1983, the Central People’s Government (CPG) proposed 12 Principles to resolve the issue of Hong Kong, which later became part of the Joint Declaration. On December 19, 1984, the Joint Declaration which reflected the basic principles and policy of “One Country, Two Systems” was concluded.",
            "The Joint Declaration is a treaty made between China and the UK. The provisions of the Joint Declaration, including its three annexes, have been deposited with the United Nations. While the latter part of the preamble of the Joint Declaration states that the two sides “agreed to declare as follows”, the crucial parts of Articles 1, 2 and 3 (read with Annex I) are all unilateral declarations made by one side without any reference to the other side. Articles 4, 5 and 6 and Annexes 2 and 3 provide for arrangements during the transitional period, while Articles 7 and 8 are about the implementation and entry into force of the instrument.",
            "From the above observations on the content and nature of the Joint Declaration, it can be seen that there is no clause that provides for British rights or obligations to Hong Kong after the city's reunification with the Motherland. Judge Xue Hanqin, Vice President of the International Court of Justice, pointed out at the Basic Law 30th Anniversary Legal Summit on November 17, 2020 that, “after the reunification, the system to be adopted in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), as well as how to implement its reunification with the Motherland, was purely within the ambit of the sovereignty of China from an international law perspective.” In a speech by Mr Xie Feng, former Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in HKSAR, he also stated, “[a]ll legal relations between the UK and Hong Kong created by the instrument had terminated by January 1, 2000 at the latest, when the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ceased operation. The UK is not entitled to claim any new rights over or obligations to Hong Kong by citing the Joint Declaration. To be brief, the UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ‘supervision’ over Hong Kong whatsoever after the latter returned to China.”",
            "The signing of the Joint Declaration marks the final resolution of the Hong Kong question, setting a laudable example on peaceful resolution of historical issues and marking a significant milestone for the reunification of China. As remarked by Judge Shi Jiuyong, former President of the International Court of Justice, the Joint Declaration “is an unprecedented treatment of invalidity of unequal treaties imposed by big powers in history. This practice can be counted as China’s contribution in the process of progressive development of contemporary international law.”",
            "At the signing of the Joint Declaration, there was also an immediate exchange of memoranda between the two sides dealing with the issue of nationality. This exchange of memoranda between the two sides represent each side’s understanding of the issue of nationality under the backdrop of the Joint Declaration.",
            "The British Memorandum to the PRC (the British Memorandum) opened with the statement “[i]n connection with the Joint Declaration... to be signed this day, the Government of the [UK] declares that...”, and stated the UK government’s pledge, inter alia, not to confer the right of abode in the UK on holders of the BN(O) passport who are Chinese nationals in Hong Kong. Similarly, the Chinese Memorandum to the UK opens with acknowledging receipt of the British Memorandum, stating “[t]he Government of the [PRC] has received the memorandum from the Government of the [UK]…”, going on to assert that, inter alia, “[u]nder the Nationality Law of the [PRC], all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots… are Chinese nationals”, and then makes the commitment to “permit Chinese nationals in Hong Kong who were previously called ‘British Dependent Territories Citizens’ to use travel documents issued by the government of the UK for the purpose of travelling to other states and regions”.",
            "A pertinent question would be the nature and legal effect of the memoranda in question, in particular the UK government’s pledge as contained in the British Memorandum regarding the conferral of the right of abode to BN(O) passport holders who are Chinese nationals in Hong Kong. This would depend on whether it could give rise to a binding effect as a unilateral act under international law.",
            "According to the International Law Commission’s “Guiding principles applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations” (Guiding Principles), declarations publicly made and manifesting the will to be bound may have the effect of creating legal obligations, taking into account their content, the factual circumstances in which they were made, and of the reactions to which they gave rise. In the Nuclear Tests case, the International Court of Justice also held that a unilateral declaration is binding when the State proclaiming it intends to undertake a legal obligation.",
            "It is noteworthy that the UK also considered the provisions contained in the British Memorandum to be of binding effect. For example, in 1985, at the second reading of the Hong Kong Bill in the UK House of Commons, the then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Sir Geoffrey Howe, remarked that the proposed powers to make the amendments to the then nationality legislation are “necessary as a result of the [Joint Declaration] and the [British Memorandum]”. Additionally, in his 2008 Review of Citizenship, former Attorney General for England and Wales, Lord Goldsmith, recognised that to give BN(O)s full British citizenship automatically would be a breach of the commitments made between the PRC and the UK in the Joint Declaration, noting: “The only option… would be to offer existing BN(O) holders the right to gain full British citizenship… However I am advised that this would be a breach of the commitments made between China and the UK in the 1984 Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong…”.",
            "In line with China’s countermeasures against the British government's handling of issues related to BN(O) passport, the HKSAR Government has announced the non-recognition of the BN(O) passport as a valid travel document and proof of identity. With effect from tomorrow, BN(O) passports cannot be used for immigration clearance and will not be recognised as any form of proof of identity in Hong Kong.",

            "英國政府公布持英國國民（海外）護照的港人可申請居留簽證。大家只要正確理解《中英聯合聲明》（《聯合聲明》），就會明白《聯合聲明》並無任何條款讓英方在香港回歸袓國後承擔任何權責。",
            "一九八三年七月十二日，中央人民政府提出解決香港問題的十二項基本方針，其後納入《聯合聲明》。一九八四年十二月十九日，中英雙方簽署體現「一國兩制」各項基本方針政策的《聯合聲明》。",
            "《聯合聲明》是中國和英國之間的條約。《聯合聲明》的條款包括它的三個附件，已存於聯合國。雖然《聯合聲明》序言的結尾部分陳述雙方「同意聲明如下」，《聯合聲明》的關鍵部分，即第一、二及三款（連同附件一）全都是其中一方的單方面聲明而並沒有提及另一方。第四、五、六款及附件二和三是有關過渡期間的安排，而第七及八款則關於文件的生效和實施。",
            "從以上有關《聯合聲明》內容及性質的觀察，可見《聯合聲明》並無任何條款讓英方在香港回歸袓國後承擔任何權責。國際法院副院長薛捍勤法官於去年十一月十七日舉辦《基本法》頒布三十周年法律高峰論壇上指出：「香港回歸後，採取什麽制度，如何實現國家的統一，從國際法上講，屬於中國主權範圍内的事務。」 外交部駐香港特區特派員公署前特派員謝鋒也在一次演講中說明：「所有因《聯合聲明》而產生的在英國和香港之間的法律聯繫，最遲在中英聯合聯絡小組二○○○年一月一日終止工作時已結束。英國無權再根據《聯合聲明》對香港提出新的權利和責任主張。簡而言之，對於回歸後的香港，英國無主權、無管轄權，亦無『監督』權。」",
            "《聯合聲明》的簽署，標誌著香港問題終於獲得解決，樹立了和平解決歷史問題的典範，奠下中華民族統一大業的堅實基礎。正如前國際法院院長史久鏞法官所言，《聯合聲明》「是處理歷史上列強強加的、無效的不平等條約的前所未見的方法。這個方式可說是中國在當代國際公法向前發展的過程中，對促進和平解決歷史問題的貢獻」。",
            "在簽署《聯合聲明》的同時，雙方亦即時就國籍問題 交換了備忘錄。雙方交換備忘錄反映出彼此在《聯合聲明》下，對國籍問題的理解。",
            "英方致中華人民共和國的備忘錄（英方備忘錄）開首便指出「聯繫到今天簽訂的大不列顛及北愛爾蘭聯合王國政府和中華人民共和國政府關於香港問題的聯合聲明，聯合王國政府聲明…」並說明英國政府不會賦予持有英國國民（海外）護照的香港的中國公民居英權。同樣地，我國致英方的備忘錄開首便清楚表示收悉英方備忘錄，並指出「中華人民共和國政府收到了大不列顛及北愛爾蘭聯合王國政府一九八四年十二月十九日的備忘錄。」及後並説明：「根據中華人民共和國國籍法，所有香港中國同胞，不論其是否持有『英國屬土公民護照』，都是中國公民。」 我國致英方的備忘錄並承諾：「允許原被稱為『英國屬土公民』的香港中國公民使用由聯合王國政府簽發的旅行證件去其他國家和地區旅行。」",
            "一個至關重要的問題為英方備忘錄的性質和法律效力，尤其是其關於會否賦予持有英國國民（海外）護照的香港的中國公民居英權的問題。這將取決於它是否構成在國際法中有約束力的單方面行為。",
            "根據國際法委員會的「適用於能夠產生法律義務的國家單方面聲明的指導原則」（指導原則），考慮聲明的內容、其作出時的所有實際情況及其所引起的反應，公開發表並表明受約束意願的聲明，可能會產生法律義務的效力。在核實驗案中。國際法院確認當相關國家聲稱意圖承擔法律義務的時候，單方面的行為會具有約束力。",
            "值得注意的是英國認為英方備忘錄的條文具約束力。例如在一九八五年英國下議院二讀香港法草案時，時任英國外交大臣賀維爵士指出所建議的、用以修改當時國籍法的權力「基於[《聯合聲明》]及[英方備忘錄]是需要的」。此外，英格蘭及威爾斯前總檢察長高仕文勳爵在二○○八年的國民資格檢討中認為，若賦予英國國民（海外）護照持有人自動擁有完整的英國公民資格，會違背中英雙方在《聯合聲明》中的承諾，他認為「唯一的辦法…是讓現時持有英國國民（海外）護照的人擁有完整英國公民資格…但根據意見，這會違背中英雙方一九八四年在《聯合聲明》有關香港前途的承諾…」。",
            "特區政府全面配合國家針對英國政府就處理英國國民（海外）護照事宜採取反制措施，並已宣布，不承認英國國民（海外）護照作為有效旅行證件和身分證明，由明日起，英國國民（海外）護照不能用於在香港出入境，亦不會在香港獲承認為任何形式的身分證明。",
