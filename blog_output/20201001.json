            "Today is the 71st anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. Last time the Mid-Autumn Festival fell on the National Day was back in 2001. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a safe and healthy Mid-Autumn Festival alongside the celebration of the National Day.",
            "After 71 years of development, our country has made significant achievements with rapid economic and social changes. In 1978, China adopted a policy to modernise the agriculture, industry, science and technology as well as national defense, embarking on the remarkable journey of reform and opening-up. Today, China has become the second largest economy in the world.",
            "In the early days of our country’s reform and opening-up, a large number of Hong Kong entrepreneurs invested in the Mainland and became China’s window to the world, bringing in capital, talent and management system. Meanwhile, a lot of Hong Kong manufacturers moved their production lines northward to the Pearl River Delta region, creating business opportunities for entrepreneurs and making Hong Kong the bridge linking the Mainland and the global market. This enabled Hong Kong to establish and reinforce its present position as an international commercial, logistic, shipping, financial and professional service centre.",
            "Hong Kong has been leveraging its advantages to integrate into the growth of our country, manifesting the principle of “joint development, shared prosperity”. The results were well recognised. The Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Greater Bay Area have provided ample opportunities to us. We should capitalise on our unique position under the “One Country, Two Systems” and utilise our talent and experience in finance, legal and technology sectors to complement the development of the Greater Bay Area and expand our business along the Belt and Road development. This will not only revitalise the city but also make new contributions to our country.",
            "This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the Basic Law's promulgation. The concept of “One Country, Two Systems” is successfully implemented in the form of law under the Basic Law, keeping Hong Kong prosperous and stable. The Department of Justice is currently preparing for “Legal Summit for the 30th Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Basic Law – ‘Back to Basic’” in which experts will be invited to talk about the relationship among the Constitution, the Basic Law and “One Country, Two Systems” from different perspectives, with a view to enhancing the public's understanding of the Constitution and the Basic Law.",
            "In the Chinese tradition, country and family are inseparable. Our country provides a strong support to each of her nationals, ensuring that we can live and work in peace and prosperity. A stable family leads to a prosperous society. Last but not the least, I wish our country continued peace and prosperity in the years to come.",

            "今天是中華人民共和國成立七十一周年的大日子，也適逢是中秋佳節。對上一次國慶與中秋節「喜相逢」，是在2001年。今天大家慶祝國慶，亦祝願大家有一個平安和健康的中秋節。",
            "國家經過了七十一年的發展，經濟和社會上都產生了巨大變化，取得了輝煌成就。國家在1978年推出政策，實現農業、工業、科技和國防現代化，開展了國家改革開放的歷程，今天已經成為世界第二大的經濟體。",
            "在國家改革開放的初期，大批港商到內地投資，成為當時國家的對外窗口，輸入資金、人才及管理制度。與此同時，不少香港製造業的生產線北移至珠三角地區，為香港的企業創造了不少的發展機會，亦令香港變成內地與世界市場之間的橋樑，建立和鞏固了香港今天作為國際商貿、物流、航運、金融和專業服務中心的地位。",
            "香港過去一直利用自身的優勢融合國家發展，體現了「同發展」、「共繁榮」，帶來的成就有目共睹。現時國家的「一帶一路」建設和粵港澳大灣區規劃，為香港帶來龐大的機遇，香港應當發揮「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢，善用在金融、法律、科技等領域的經驗，配合大灣區的發展，以及在「一帶一路」沿線開拓業務，為香港的經濟注入新的動力之餘，更加可以為國家作出新的貢獻。",
            "今年也是《基本法》頒布三十周年，《基本法》以法律把「一國兩制」這個偉大構想成功落實，保持香港的繁榮和穩定。律政司正積極籌備「《基本法》頒布三十周年法律高峰論壇—追本溯源」，邀請專家從不同角度講解《憲法》、《基本法》以及「一國兩制」的關係，希望藉此提升社會對《憲法》和《基本法》的認知。",
            "在中國人的傳統裡，國與家有著密不可分的關係。國家是每一個國民的堅強後盾，保障我們可以安居樂業，有安定的家庭才有繁榮的社會，祝願國家繁榮昌盛，國泰民安。",
