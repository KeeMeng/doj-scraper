            "The outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for national economic and social development and the long-range objectives through the year 2035 (Outline) emphasises the need to maintain Hong Kong’s long term prosperity and stability, which again demonstrates the Central People’s Government’s (CPG) staunch support and care towards Hong Kong. The 14th Five-Year Plan provides a blueprint for the nation’s social and economic development, whilst at the same time sets the scene for the future development of Hong Kong.",
            "Hong Kong, on the premise of “One Country, Two Systems” and under the principle of pursuing mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, has a unique role to play under the 14th Five-Year Plan. We should make best use of our strength to meet the needs of the country and couple the support of the country with our own efforts in order to consolidate and foster the development of Hong Kong itself, as well as that of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and our country.",
            "The Outline reiterates the need to maintain Hong Kong’s long term prosperity and stability, which requires the resolute, full and faithful implementation of the policy of “One Country, Two Systems” under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the laws of Hong Kong as well as to safeguard the constitutional order of Hong Kong formed under the Constitution and the Basic Law. On the other hand, the Outline reflects the importance of raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness and CPG’s staunch support towards the same.",
            "In the area of legal and dispute resolution services, I am delighted to learn that the Outline supports Hong Kong to establish itself as the centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, and transform Hong Kong’s service sector into a high value-added industry. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is working closely with relevant Mainland ministries and departments with a view to implementing more liberalisation and new measures. The GBA Legal Professional Examination and the Supplemental Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards between the Mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are the two recent breakthroughs facilitating the sustainable development of Hong Kong’s legal and dispute resolution services in the GBA (please see my blog on January 3 for information on these two measures: https://www.doj.gov.hk/en/community_engagement/sj_blog/20210103_blog1.html).",
            "Besides, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area Legal Departments Joint Conference endorsed the proposal to set up a GBA Mediation Platform on 11 December 2020, which will facilitate the use of mediation and discharge the role of a standard-setting body with a view to promoting the wider use of mediation within the GBA.",
            "All these measures have played a significant role in strengthening the promotion of Hong Kong’s legal and dispute resolution service in the GBA, and further foster the integration and professional exchanges between the two places.",
            "Looking ahead, we will continue to consolidate our efforts in deepening mutual collaboration with the Mainland in terms of legal and dispute resolution services. Hong Kong enterprises registered in Qianhai were recently allowed to choose Hong Kong law as the applicable law in their civil and commercial contracts. We are now actively seeking the support of the CPG in extending the measure to the entire GBA. In addition, the proposal on the establishment of a mechanism on corporate insolvency is in in the pipeline. We are striving for a consensus with the Supreme People’s Court on to explore the first launch of this mechanism in the city with the closest economic relationship with Hong Kong in the GBA (such as Shenzhen) as a pilot area. Such arrangement will help enhance Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for insolvency and debt restructuring and further enrich the content of mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters.",
            "In order to nurture more legal talents who are familiar with the legal systems of both places, the DoJ encourages the legal sector to make best of the GBA Youth Employment Scheme introduced by the HKSAR Government to support young local practitioners who aspire to work in the Mainland cities. Moreover, financial incentives have also been provided to eligible young legal professionals who are working and living in Qianhai by the Administration Bureau of Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone. We believe all these measures will encourage more legal talents to grasp the opportunities to pursue their career in the GBA cities.",
            "In addition to commercial matters, it is expected that the Mainland Judgments in Matrimonial and Family Cases (Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement) Bill will be passed in the current legislative session. By then, parties to a judgment given in a matrimonial or family case no longer need to litigate separately for the same dispute in a Mainland court and a Hong Kong court, thereby saving time and cost and reducing emotional distress. More importantly, parties concerned can expeditiously receive effective judicial redress.",
            "Since the enactment of the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, order and stability in our community had been restored. Hong Kong is now ready to capitalise on its unique position under the “One Country, Two Systems”, thereby leveraging Hong Kong's advantages in order to meet the nation’s needs and to create greater synergy. I will continue to work with my fellow colleagues of the Department of Justice to utilise Hong Kong’s advantages in legal and dispute resolution services in order to strengthen Hong Kong’s enviable status as an international legal hub, as well as to make the best use of the opportunity brought forth by the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, thereby contributing to the prosperity of our country.",

            "《中華人民共和國國民經濟和社會發展第十四個五年規劃和2035年遠景目標綱要》（綱要）提出保持香港長期繁榮穩定，再一次體現中央對香港的關顧及堅定支持。「十四五」規劃是國家的社會經濟發展藍圖，同時亦為香港的未來發展定下路向。",
            "香港在「十四五」規劃的功能及地位，應以「一國兩制」為前提以互惠共贏為原則，把國家所需與香港所長結合，把祖國支持與自身努力結合，從而把香港的優勢加以鞏固和提升，與此同時促進香港、大灣區以至國家的長遠發展。",
            "綱要要求保持香港長期繁榮穩定，並需要全面準確貫徹「一國兩制」、「港人治港」、高度自治的方針，堅持依法治港，維護《憲法》和《基本法》確定的特別行政區憲制秩序等，同時亦突顯中央重視及支持香港鞏固提升自身的競爭優勢。",
            "在法律及解決爭議服務方面，我欣喜見到綱要提到支持香港建設亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心，並支持香港服務業向高端高增值方向發展。律政司正與內地相關部門密切聯繫，致力在大灣區落實更多有關法律服務的開放措施和新措施，其中最近有兩項重大突破有助香港的法律及解決爭議服務在大灣區內持續發展，包括粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試以及《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的補充安排》（內容可參閱我在一月三日發表的網誌https://www.doj.gov.hk/tc/community_engagement/sj_blog/20210103_blog1.html）。",
            "還有2020年12月11日舉行的第二次粵港澳大灣區法律部門聯席會議通過了「粵港澳大灣區調解平台建設工作方案」，粵港澳大灣區調解平台將促進調解的使用並發揮一個制定標準的角色，目標為促進調解在大灣區的應用。",
            "這些措施對加強推動香港法律及爭議解決服務業拓展大灣區的市場發揮了積極作用，促進兩地融合和專業交流。",
            "展望將來，我們會致力深化與內地在法律和爭議解決服務方面的合作。在前海合作區註冊的港資企業最近被允許選擇香港法律作為民商事合同適用的法律。我們正積極尋求中央政府支持把措施擴大至整個大灣區。此外，訂立有關公司清盤事宜的合作機制正在籌劃中，我們正尋求與最高人民法院達成共識，探討在一些與香港有緊密經濟關係的大灣區城市（如深圳）作為試點推出。這將有助提升香港作為提供清盤和債務重組服務的區域地位，並令到民商事司法互助的內容更為豐富。",
            "為培養更多熟悉兩地法律制度的人才，律政司鼓勵法律界善用香港特區政府早前推出的大灣區青年就業計劃，支持立志在內地城市從事法律工作的本地年輕執業者。除此以外，前海深港現代服務業合作區管理局亦安排向在前海工作和生活的合資格年輕法律專業人士提供財政資助。我們相信這些措施將鼓勵更多的法律人才把握機會在大灣區城市建立事業。",
            "除了商事方面，律政司預計在這一個立法年度可以通過《內地婚姻家庭案件判決（相互承認及強制執行）條例草案》，屆時，可望減少婚姻或家庭判決的當事人，就同一爭議需要在內地和香港的法院分別提出訴訟，節省時間和費用之餘，亦減輕他們的精神壓力，更重要的是讓他們便捷地獲得有效的司法濟助。",
            "《香港國安法》落實以來，香港社會由亂及治，社會氛圍風清氣正，並已經恢復秩序和穩定。我相信，香港現在已經作好準備，充分利用「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢，為國家所需發揮香港所長，同內地優勢互補、協同發展。我跟律政司的同事會積極善用及發揮香港在法律及解決爭議服務方面的實力，繼續鞏固香港作為國際法律樞紐的地位，抓緊「十四五」規劃帶來的機遇，更好融入國家發展大局，為國家的繁榮作出貢獻。",
