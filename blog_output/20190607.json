            "The 5th Criminal Law Conference, jointly organized by the Department of Justice, the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association, has just concluded another successful run. The conference was attended by some 200 local legal practitioners and a number of representatives from four ASEAN jurisdictions. I was pleased to welcome two distinguished guest speakers – Lady Justice Hallett, Vice-President of the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales; and Ms Julie Read, Chief Executive and Director of the Serious Fraud Office of New Zealand.",
            "Together with our invited panelists, Lady Justice Hallett and Ms Read shared with us their rich experience and insights on the four themes of this year’s conference, namely: cybercrime, money laundering, trafficking in persons and sexual offences. I believe participants benefitted from the candid and in-depth discussions.",
            "We particularly valued the opportunity for international exchange and co-operation. With the advent of technologies, the world is shrinking with increased flows of people, goods, information and capital. As an international financial centre and a highly connected city, Hong Kong’s airport and container port are some of the busiest in the world. These have of course brought a lot of business opportunities to Hong Kong. Yet, they are also exposing us to the risks of cross-border crimes. That is why all four themes at this year’s Conference are pressing issues, and they can only be tackled through proactive enforcement and judicial co-operation without geographical limitations.",
            "Hong Kong has always been an active and responsible player in the international fight against crime. Under the principle of \"one country, two systems\", Hong Kong is allowed to establish our own regime of reciprocal juridical assistance with other jurisdictions. Such a framework should be workable, provide the appropriate safeguards for the fugitive offenders, and importantly be applicable to all the jurisdictions in the world. I sincerely hope that we are now moving in this direction.",

            "由律政司刑事檢控科、香港律師會和香港大律師公會合辦的第五屆刑事法律研討會剛剛圓滿結束。今年的研討會吸引了約200位法律從業員參與；除了本地司法人員外，還包括幾位來自四個東盟成員國的代表。我們非常高興邀請到兩位出色的嘉賓－英格蘭及威爾斯上訴法院刑事法庭副庭長Lady Justice Hallett以及紐西蘭嚴重欺詐辦公室主任Julie Read女士－擔任研討會的主講者。",
            "她們兩位跟其他的演講嘉賓分享了在刑事法律方面的豐富經驗，並且對研討會的四項主題：網絡罪行、洗黑錢、販運人口及性罪行，提出了精闢的見解，我相信在座的與會者都獲益良多。",
            "我們非常重視國際之間的交流及合作，隨著日新月異的科技不斷發展，世界的距離正在逐漸變小，加速了人流、物流、訊息流和資金流，香港作為國際金融中心及一個四通八達的城市，擁有最繁忙的機場及港口，這樣的趨勢當然為我們帶來不少商機，但同時亦代表香港面對跨境罪行的挑戰。因此今年研討會的主題正是全球面臨的迫切挑戰，我們必須要透過無地域限制的執法和司法合作，才能夠徹底解決問題。",
            "香港過去一直積極參與國際合作共同打擊罪行，在“一國兩制”的原則下，香港可以就司法互助關係與其他司法管轄區作出適當安排。這個安排必須可行、提供適當保障，最重要是適用於所有司法管轄區，才能夠發揮作用。我衷心希望香港朝著這個方向繼續邁進。",
