            "Hong Kong has, for the first time, held the Willem C. Vis (East) International Commercial Arbitration Moot (VEM) through an online platform amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. While most of the competitions in other jurisdictions have been cancelled or postponed due to challenges posed by the pandemic, the 17th VEM was the only international mooting which went ahead as scheduled through an online dispute resolution (ODR) platform.",
            "Though the outbreak of COVID-19 has changed our travel patterns and presented many challenges, advance in modern technology has helped us to address them. For the first time in the Moot’s history, the mooting competition was conducted completely online with the support of eBRAM. The platform supported by eBRAM accommodated 71 teams from 21 jurisdictions and about 250 arbitrators from 52 jurisdictions to take part in the Moot which started on March 22. This exemplifies the importance of technological developments in the legal field.",
            "The audience, with the latest lawtech support by eBRAM, watched the online lively and intensive oral arguments with participants of the finalists showing considerable flair and aptitude in trying their best in presenting their case to an international panel of distinguished arbitrators. The Chinese University of Hong Kong won the competition after rounds of rigorous and remarkable oral submissions before the distinguished panel of arbitrators.",
            "The Government of Hong Kong has always been supportive of the development of lawtech spearheaded by, amongst others, eBRAM, which is expected to be launched this year to resolve cross-border disputes online. If funding is approved by the Finance Committee on time, eBRAM would be able to provide an efficient, cost-effective, and safe online platform for deal-making and resolution of cross-border commercial and investment disputes. We understand that eBRAM also plans to develop an online dispute resolution platform to support cross border business-to-business transactions in the APEC Region.",
            "We would continue to offer our support to the VEM as part of our legal education campaign. However, the VEM would not have been held smoothly without the technical support provided by eBRAM and also the tenacity and determination displayed by the Vis East Moot Foundation. The successful conclusion of the Moot proved that Hong Kong has the capability of developing lawtech.",
            "Changes are inevitable, including technological changes. The pandemic outbreak posed new challenges to Hong Kong but it also provides an opportunity for us to explore lawtech in the provision of legal services. We all should join hands to make best use of the technologies to develop ODR to assist all parties in resolving disputes in an efficient, effective and fair manner with a view to bringing rule of law and justice for all.",

            "雖然香港受到2019冠狀病毒的疫情影響，但國際模擬法庭比賽仍然首次透過網上平台在香港成功舉行。很多不同地區籌辦的模擬法庭比賽都因為疫情而需要取消或押後，但第十七屆國際模擬法庭比賽仍然按原定計劃，透過一個網上平台繼續進行。",
            "疫情影響了不少人的外遊計劃，同時帶來不少困難，但科技卻協助我們解決了難題。今年的國際模擬法庭比賽就是在一邦國際網上仲調中心（eBRAM）支援下，首次完全在網上進行。由三月二十二日起，來自二十一個地區的七十一支參賽隊伍、以及來自五十二個地區約二百五十名仲裁員，透過一邦國際支援的網上平台參與比賽，這證明了科技在法律界的重要性。",
            "在決賽當晚，觀眾透過一邦國際支援的最新法律科技在網上平台欣賞了一場精彩緊湊的辯論，大家都感受到決賽兩支隊伍施展渾身解數，向一班國際知名仲裁員組成的評判團陳情。最終香港中文大學在卓越的仲裁員評判團前，憑著出色和縝密的口頭陳述，勝出比賽。",
            "香港政府一直支持發展法律科技，包括由一邦國際預計在今年推出跨境爭議解決服務。如果財務委員會適時批准相關撥款，一邦國際便能夠提供一個有效、具成本效益和安全的網上平台，用作促成交易和處理跨境商業及投資糾紛。我們亦得悉一邦國際計劃發展網上爭議解決平台支援在亞太經合組織區內企業對企業的交易。",
            "作為法律教育的一部分，我們將繼續支持國際模擬法庭比賽。今屆的賽事得以順利完成，實在有賴一邦國際的技術支援以及主辦機構Vis East Moot Foundation的堅持不懈和決心。今次香港成功舉辦這項比賽，正好說明香港有能力發展法律科技。",
            "改變是無可避免的，科技所帶來的轉變亦一樣。疫情雖然帶來了不少挑戰，但同時亦提供機會讓我們探討使用科技來提升法律服務。我們應攜手善用科技，開拓網上爭議解決服務，協助各方以有效、快捷和公平的方式處理爭議，從而為所有人帶來“法治公義，普惠共享”。",
