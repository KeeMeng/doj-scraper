            "I am delighted to learn that the inaugural Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) Legal Professional Examination (GBA Exam) was held successfully in Hong Kong today. I am truly grateful to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) for its policy on implementing the GBA Exam and related training, and its dedicated efforts all along.",
            "The GBA Exam originally scheduled to be held earlier this year was postponed due to the pandemic. The MoJ then decided to set up new examination venues in Hong Kong in addition to those in Shenzhen and Zhuhai, and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice (DoJ) for the DoJ to co-ordinate with the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority to handle examination-related work. Such arrangement has brought great convenience to Hong Kong candidates.",
            "Thanks to the MoJ's staunch support all along, the GBA Exam was set up in response to the suggestions and aspirations of the Hong Kong legal sector. It will no doubt provide an extensive arena for the sector's development in the Mainland. Relevant pre-examination legal training was organised by the MoJ for candidates sitting the GBA Exam. For those who have passed the GBA Exam, practical training courses on Mainland laws, to be arranged by the DoJ in co-operation with Mainland organs like the Supreme People's Court, will be provided to enhance their practical knowledge on Mainland courts' handling of different areas of civil and commercial matters.",
            "The GBA Exam is a liberalisation measure under the CEPA. After passing the examination and obtaining the relevant practice certificate, Hong Kong legal practitioners, including solicitors and barristers, with accumulated legal practice experience of five years or above, are allowed to provide legal services in the nine Mainland municipalities in the GBA on specified civil and commercial matters (including litigation and non-litigation matters) to which the Mainland laws apply. They will also enjoy the same privileges and under the same obligations as Mainland lawyers. In the nine Mainland municipalities in the GBA, they can be retained by Mainland law firms and partnership associations of Mainland law firms and Hong Kong or Macao law firms, and can become partners of Mainland law firms.",
            "The GBA Exam not only offers significant opportunities and practical experience for the Hong Kong legal sector in the GBA, but also provides clients in the GBA (including wholly-owned Hong Kong enterprises) Hong Kong and Mainland legal services and safeguards, which are conducive to the enhancement of legal services and the building of rule of law environment in the GBA, thereby promoting closer integration of legal services in the area to attract more investments. The GBA Exam has also laid a foundation on co-operation channels in the future and deepened the exchanges between the legal sectors of both places, thereby achieving the goal of mutual benefits.",
            "If the results of the GBA Exam are satisfactory, I hope that the coverage of the Exam will be further extended.",
            "Once again I would like to express my wholehearted thanks to the MoJ for creating opportunities for the Hong Kong legal profession. I hope that very soon our legal practitioners will have better developments in the Mainland, and at the same time, they will contribute to the building of rule of law for our country.",

            "我很高興得悉司法部主辦的首次粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試（大灣區考試）今日在香港順利舉行，在此我必須感謝司法部推出粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試和相關培訓的政策，一直以來大力落實大灣區考試。",
            "原定今年初舉行的考試，因為疫情延期。司法部隨後決定在深圳及珠海以外增設香港考場，與律政司簽署備忘錄，由律政司協調香港考試及評核局負責考務工作，為香港考生帶來莫大便利。",
            "我非常感謝司法部的大力支持，設立了粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試，積極回應了香港法律界的意見和期望，為業界在內地發展提供了一個廣闊的平台。報考者不僅在考試前可參加由司法部組織的有關法律知識培訓，通過考試的香港法律界人士，更可參加由律政司與最高人民法院等內地單位合作安排的內地法律實務培訓課程，增強他們對內地法院處理不同範疇的民商事宜的實務知識。",
            "大灣區考試是CEPA下的開放措施，累計執業五年的香港法律執業者（包括律師和大律師），在通過考試取得相關執業證書後，可以在大灣區內地九市辦理適用內地法律的部分民商事法律事務（含訴訟業務和非訴訟業務），並與內地律師享有相同的權利，履行相同的義務；可以受聘於大灣區內地九市的內地律師事務所或是港澳與內地合夥聯營律師事務所，並可以成為大灣區內地九市的內地律師事務所合夥人。",
            "大灣區考試除了為香港法律界在大灣區帶來更多機遇及實踐經驗外，亦可為大灣區客戶（包括港資企業）提供香港及內地的法律服務及保障，有利提升大灣區法律服務和法治環境的建設，促進大灣區法律服務的互通融合，同時讓大灣區吸引更多投資。大灣區考試並為日後提供合作渠道奠定基礎，深化兩地法律界的交流，達致互利共贏的目標。",
            "若大灣區考試的效果理想，我希望可以進一步擴大適用範圍。",
            "我衷心感謝司法部為香港法律業界創造機遇，並期待在不久將來，香港法律執業者可以在內地有更大的發展，同時也為國家的法治建設作出貢獻。",
