            "COVID-19 unfortunately seems determined to linger and continue to affect part of our lives. Civilisation has to cope with it as a whole in solidarity. I think it is important that apart from some solidarity as we see in the world, as the Secretary-General of the UN said in the World Health Assembly, we need to have more unity. Unity in the sense of better coordination amongst places. Supply chain of goods and services will also have to be coordinated if we move from solidarity to unity in a more systematic way.",
            "Hong Kong has been playing its part in measures that may be described as recognize, strategize, legalize and revitalize, like what I said in a webinar (https://spblegalforum.com/en/Video_Addresses). The recent third wave may need us to revive and modify what has been done so as to contain the damage whilst getting ready for the new normal.",
            "In controlling borders as one of the first strategy, exemptions have to be introduced. The Department of Justice introduced a mechanism for eligible legal practitioners, arbitrators or mediators to apply for exemption from the compulsory quarantine arrangement (www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/20200519_sjo1.html). We further expanded the scope to allow more legal practitioners who are providing necessary professional services in relation to important and large-scale commercial transactions for exemption. Without such move, some proceedings might need to be postponed. On the other hand, this measure helps contribute to maintaining Hong Kong as a capital raising centre for Mainland enterprises as many listing work nowadays ties with the Mainland.",
            "The LawTech Fund, which was established by the Government under the second round of the Anti-epidemic Fund to subsidize eligible law firms and barristers’ chambers in procuring and upgrading information technology systems, encourages the use of technologies in the provision of legal services in light of the General Adjourned Period by the Judiciary. More than 290 applications have been received so far. As some practitioners are looking for more time in preparing their applications following the announcement of the Judiciary’s expanded practice for remote hearings through the use of video-conferencing facilities, we have extended the closing date to July 26. This also allows them to take into account the Judiciary’s integrated court case management system, an electronic mode for handling court-related documents and payments, in procuring suitable LawTech equipment.",
            "Last but not the least, the COVID-19 Online Dispute Resolution Scheme (www.ebram.org/covid_19_odr.html) managed by eBRAM was launched to facilitates negotiation, mediation and arbitration between parties through an online platform to resolve disputes arising from or related to COVID-19. This speedy and cost effective means to resolve disputes, becoming a new normal in our daily life, may help relieve court’s caseload in civil claims. At the same time, it also has the benefit of job creation and job advancement for mediators and arbitrators (including their pupils).",
            "The pandemic has caused an unprecedented impact on Hong Kong's economy. The Government must take resolute and exceptional measures to prevent the situation from deteriorating. We have been closely monitoring the situation in the legal and dispute resolution sector to provide timely support. Let’s remain vigilant and be aware of as well as prepared for the changes that sweep across the globe.",

            "最近疫情似乎有急劇變化的跡象，我們的日常生活或多或少都會受到影響。同心攜手是一種有效方法去抗疫，但我更認同聯合國秘書長早前在世界衛生大會上所說，除了需要相互支持外，更需要團結一致。各地都應該採取更好的協調工作，若想更有系統地處理貨物及服務的供應，我們更加需要進一步由相互支持步向團結一致。",
            "就像我早前在一個網上研討會（https://spblegalforum.com/en/Video_Addresses）指出，香港處理疫情的措施可以歸納為“識別化、策略化、合法化、振興化”。現在面對疫情第三波，我們需要調整和更新策略以減輕損害，並要預備迎接新常態。",
            "在出入境管制措施中提供豁免是其中一項策略，律政司早前已推出了為合資格的法律執業者、仲裁員或調解員提供豁免強制檢疫的機制（www.doj.gov.hk/chi/public/20200519_sjo1.html），最近更擴大豁免機制，進一步協助法律及爭議解決業界處理重大商業交易的相關工作，讓多一些業界人士受惠。這樣可以避免延遲相關程序，另一方面，由於現時很多上市工作都與內地有關，這項措施亦有助香港繼續成為內地企業籌集資金的中心。",
            "第二輪“防疫抗疫基金”下設立的“法律科技基金”，資助合資格的律師事務所及大律師辦事處購買或提升資訊科技系統，以鼓勵善用科技提供法律服務來配合法庭程序一般延期的安排。現時已接獲超過290份申請，由於司法機構公布了擴大使用視像會議設施，有律師希望用多一點時間來預備申請，因此我們將基金的截止申請日期延至七月二十六日，亦讓他們在購買資訊科技設備時，可以考慮司法機構推出的“綜合法院案件管理系統”（透過電子模式處理與法庭有關的文件和進行付款）這一個因素。",
            "由一邦國際網上仲調中心管理的\"新型冠狀病毒網上爭議解決計劃\"（www.ebram.org/covid_19_odr.html?language=tc）已正式推出，讓爭議雙方通過網上平台進行談判、調解及仲裁，解決與新型冠狀病毒相關的爭議。這項計劃便捷、具成本效益，將會成為我們社會的新常態，既有助紓緩法院民事索償的案件量，同時亦為調解員和仲裁員（包括他們的學徒）帶來就業機會。",
            "疫情造成了史無前例的衝擊，政府有必要採取果斷的措施防止情況惡化。律政司會一直留意法律及爭議解決業界的需要，以提供適切的支援。大家對疫情必須提高警惕，但亦要對日後為全球帶來的轉變做足準備。",
