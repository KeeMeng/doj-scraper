            "It has been a great honour for me to attend the ceremony to mark the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Shenzhen has developed rapidly in the past 40 years with remarkable results, which are very promising. In his speech at the ceremony, President Xi Jinping mentioned that the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area should be further manoeuvred, describing it as a major national development strategy in which Shenzhen is a “core engine”. President Xi also highlighted the importance of grasping the significant and historical opportunities brought by the development of the Greater Bay Area, strengthening the regulatory interface and connectivity of the economy of the three places.",
            "Since the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (the Outline Development Plan) was announced last year, the Department of Justice has been actively communicating with relevant Mainland authorities to reflect views and expectations of the department and Hong Kong legal sector, which are carefully considered by the Central Authorities. It demonstrates the unique position and advantages enjoyed by the HKSAR under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle.",
            "I am delighted to learn that the guidelines of the pilot programme for Hong Kong and Macao legal practitioners to obtain Mainland practice qualifications and to practise law in the nine Pearl River Delta municipalities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area allow solicitors and barristers with five years of post-qualification experience to apply for the examination. Young legal practitioners will be able to grasp the opportunities brought by the development of the Greater Bay Area. Relevant legal training to be organised by the Ministry of Justice will help better equip Hong Kong's legal practitioners for the examination.",
            "The guidelines published by the General Office of the State Council set out the requirements for the legal professional qualifying examination, the scope of practice and more. I outline the following provisions in the guidelines which are relevant to Hong Kong legal practitioners.",
            "(1) Eligibility for examination:",
            "* Hong Kong permanent residents who are Chinese nationals;",
            "* Upholding the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and the Basic Law of the HKSAR;",
            "* Qualified solicitors or barristers with five-year post- qualification experience.",
            "(2) Examination",
            "* Legal practitioners can sit for the examination after attending the training course organised by the Ministry of Justice.",
            "(3) Practising",
            "* Hong Kong legal practitioners who passed the examination are required to enroll in a training course organised by the Guangdong Lawyers’ Association and undergo an assessment before they can apply to the Department of Justice of Guangdong Province for practice.",
            "(4) Scope of practice",
            "* Legal practitioners, who have obtained the legal qualification (for practice in the Greater Bay Area), can provide legal services regarding specified civil and commercial affairs (including litigation and non-litigation matters) to which the Mainland laws are applicable in the nine Mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area.",
            "Since 2004, Hong Kong residents have been allowed to sit for the National Judicial Examination (now known as the National Unified Legal Professional Qualification Examination). However, the passing rate is far from satisfactory. The newly introduced measures will no doubt encourage more lawyers from Hong Kong to take part in the examination and provide legal services, after obtaining Mainland practice qualifications, to enterprises with investment in the Greater Bay Area. It will help the expansion of our professional legal services and further identify business opportunities. At the same time, enterprises which retain Hong Kong lawyers who are qualified for practice in the Greater Bay Area as well as in Hong Kong will be able to access to legal advice which form a solid legal basis of their investment, thereby attracting more investment in the area and leading to a win-win situation, reflecting the mutually beneficial relationship between the two places.",
            "In addition, there are already various measures under the CEPA that facilitate the legal sector in developing the Mainland market, including association in the form of partnership and arrangement for Hong Kong legal practitioners (including barristers) retained as legal consultants by Mainland law firms. The Department of Justice will continue to enhance our collaboration on judicial and legal services with our counterparts in Guangdong and Macao under the Outline Development Plan.",
            "The Department of Justice of Guangdong Province announced in August last year the “Trial Measures of the Department of Justice of Guangdong Province on Hong Kong Law Firms and Macao Law Firms Operating in the Form of Partnership Association with Mainland Law Firms in Guangdong Province (2019 Revision)” in which further liberalisation measures relating to partnership associations set up between Mainland and Hong Kong law firms in the Guangdong Province were implemented. These include the removal of the minimum capital injection ratio of 30 per cent by Hong Kong partner firms in the partnership associations set up between Mainland and Hong Kong law firms, as well as allowing Mainland and Hong Kong lawyers to be employed direct in the partnership associations’ own name with a view to encouraging more Hong Kong law firms to expand their business in the Guangdong Province. Also, Hong Kong legal practitioners, including barristers, are benefitted under the “Agreement Concerning Amendment to the CEPA Agreement on Trade in Services”, in which the current restriction of retention of Hong Kong solicitors and barristers as legal consultant by only one Mainland law firm has been relaxed, allowing them to be retained as legal consultant by no more than three Mainland law firms at the same time.",
            "The amendment to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Services Cooperation Zone Regulations was passed in August. Article 57 of the amendment allows Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and foreign-funded enterprises registered in the Qianhai cooperation zone to choose, by agreement, applicable laws in civil and commercial contracts. This liberalisation measure represents a breakthrough, indicating that the 11,000 enterprises registered in the Qianhai cooperation zone may now choose applicable laws, including Hong Kong laws, when entering into civil and commercial contracts.",
            "We are now exploring and studying the possibility of introducing an initiative to allow “Hong Kong-owned enterprises to adopt Hong Kong laws and arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong”. We hope that wholly owned Hong Kong enterprises (WOKE) in the Greater Bay Area, in the absence of any foreign-related elements, may choose the law of Hong Kong as the applicable law when entering into civil and commercial contracts, and decide to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration when disputes arise. Therefore, the agreement on choosing Hong Kong laws or using Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration will not be considered invalid due to the absence of any foreign-related elements. This initiative, if successfully implemented, will become another piece of good news to the Hong Kong legal sector and business and attract more investment in the Greater Bay Area.",
            "The Constitution of the PRC and the Basic Law have laid a solid foundation for \"One Country, Two Systems\" which provides Hong Kong with a unique status and advantages. The plan on implementing pilot reforms in Shenzhen to build the city into a demonstration area of socialism with Chinese characteristics for the 2020-2025 period announced earlier calls for a higher level of cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, as well as improvement of cross-border cooperation in the area of the rule of law, international legal and dispute resolution services. We must seize the opportunity, capitalise on our strengths and complement with Shenzhen so as to achieve a win-win situation.",

            "我十分榮幸出席了深圳經濟特區建立40周年的慶祝大會，深圳在過去40年的發展迅速，成績斐然，令人感到鼓舞。習近平主席在慶祝大會上的致辭提到：「積極作為深入推進粵港澳大灣區建設。粵港澳大灣區建設是國家重大發展戰略，深圳是大灣區建設的重要引擎。要抓住粵港澳大灣區建設重大歷史機遇，推動三地經濟運行的規則銜接、機制對接」。",
            "自去年公布《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》(《規劃綱要》)後，律政司一直積極與內地相關部門保持溝通，反映律政司及香港法律業界的意見和期望，意見也獲得中央慎重考慮，展示香港在「一國兩制」下所獲賦予的獨特地位和優勢。",
            "我很高興得悉剛公布的《香港法律執業者和澳門執業律師在粵港澳大灣區內地九市取得內地執業資質和從事律師職業試點辦法》（《辦法》），容許具五年執業經歷的律師和大律師報名考試，年輕的法律執業者可以把握在大灣區的機遇；而由司法部組織法律知識培訓，對香港的法律執業者準備考試有莫大的裨益。",
            "國務院辦公廳印發的《辦法》，說明了試點工作的考試及業務範圍等規定。我特別列出了部分與香港法律執業者有關的條文，方便大家掌握內容。",
            "（一）報名條件：",
            "＊香港特別行政區永久性居民中的中國公民；",
            "＊擁護《中華人民共和國憲法》及《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區基本法》；",
            "＊累計五年以上執業經歷的合資格律師或大律師。",
            "（二）考試：",
            "＊報名參加粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試的香港法律執業者應當參加由司法部組織的有關法律知識培訓，經培訓後方可參加考試。",
            "（三）申請執業：",
            "＊考試合格的香港法律執業者，經廣東省律師協會集中培訓並考核合格後，可以向廣東省司法廳申請粵港澳大灣區律師執業。",
            "（四）業務範圍：",
            "＊取得律師執業證書（粵港澳大灣區）的香港法律執業者，可以在粵港澳大灣區內地九市內，辦理適用內地法律的部分民商事法律事務（含訴訟業務和非訴訟業務）。",
            "早在2004年，香港居民便可參加國家司法考試(即國家統一法律職業資格考試的前稱)，而過去合格率不算太理想。但我相信措施落實後會吸引更多香港法律執業者參與，取得內地執業資質為在大灣區投資的企業提供服務，增加香港法律界服務範圍，有助拓展香港的專業法律服務。與此同時，企業可以聘用取得大灣區執業資質的香港法律界在大灣區為其提供內地和香港的法律意見，為投資制定穩妥的法律基礎，繼而讓大灣區吸引更多投資，這真正是雙贏，是互利互補的最佳體現。",
            "除此以外，香港在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）下，已經有多項利便法律業界開拓內地市場的措施，包括合夥聯營，以及香港法律執業者（包括大律師）在內地律師事務所擔任法律顧問的安排等。在大灣區的《規劃綱要》下，律政司繼續致力加強粵港澳司法及法律交流與協作。",
            "去年八月，廣東省司法廳在公布的《廣東省司法廳關於香港特別行政區和澳門特別行政區律師事務所與內地律師事務所在廣東省實行合夥聯營試行辦法（2019年修訂）》，率先落實在廣東省設立的合夥聯營律師事務所的進一步開放措施，包括取消香港律師事務所與內地律師事務所的合夥聯營律師事務所港方出資比例不得低於30%的限制，以及可以用本所名義直接聘用內地及香港律師等，鼓勵更多香港律師事務所在廣東省發展。另外，香港法律執業者，包括大律師，在2019年《CEPA服務貿易協議》的修訂協議下，可同時受聘於不多於三間內地律師事務所擔任法律顧問，放寬了現時每位律師或大律師只可受聘於一間內地律師事務所的限制，為他們帶來更多機遇。",
            "今年八月《深圳經濟特區前海深港現代服務業合作區條例》修訂通過，當中第57條允許在前海合作區註冊的港資、澳資、台資及外商投資企業協議選擇民商事合同適用的法律。這項「先行先試」措施是一項重大突破，意味著11,000多家在前海註冊的港資企業在訂立民商事合同時可以協議選擇合同適用的法律，包括香港法律。",
            "律政司正積極探討和研究在大灣區實施「港資港法港仲裁」的可行性，我們希望在大灣區訂立民商事合同的港資企業(Wholly Owned Hong Kong Enterprises,“WOKE”) 在沒有「涉外因素」的情況下，可選用香港法律作為合同的適用法律及約定就合同或案件的爭議在香港進行仲裁，而不會以無「涉外因素」為由認定選用香港法律或約定在香港仲裁的條文無效。這項措施如果可以成功落實，不單對香港的法律界和商界是一個喜訊，更會吸引更多企業在大灣區投資。",
            "《憲法》和《基本法》為「一國兩制」奠下穩固的基礎，「一國兩制」為香港提供了獨特的地位和優勢。早前公布的《深圳建設中國特色社會主義先行示範區綜合改革試點實施方案（2020－2025年）》，提到了推動更高水準的深港合作，以及完善法治領域跨境協作機制，健全國際法律服務和糾紛解決機制。我們必須抓緊機遇，發揮所長，與深圳互補優勢，才可締造雙贏。",
