            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) has co-organised a series of “Why Hong Kong” webinar with the Asian Academy of International Law (AAIL) since February. Following the last session “Why Invest in Hong Kong – A Look to the Future” on June 25, the series successfully concluded.",
            "A number of professionals, coming from legal and dispute resolution, financial and business sectors, were invited to share their experience and explore Hong Kong’s unique advantages from different perspectives. They all agreed that Hong Kong is still the best place for investment, deal-making and dispute resolution services, thereby reaffirming Hong Kong’s irreplaceable position to the international community.",
            "Why Hong Kong? What is the competitive edge of Hong Kong? Let me explain from three aspects.",
            "(1) Robust legal infrastructure and financial system",
            "Law and finance are closely intertwined. Hong Kong has a strong legal infrastructure and financial system, which offer a business-friendly environment and a level playing field to international business community. Hong Kong’s solid legal foundation includes the well-tested common law system and an open, transparent and independent judiciary.",
            "As the only common law jurisdiction in China, Hong Kong’s judicial independence and rule of law have been highly regarded internationally. Article 85 of the Basic Law stipulates that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. Meanwhile, Hong Kong cases are often cited in overseas jurisprudence evidencing the confidence and respect of the global legal community in Hong Kong’s judicial and legal systems. As pointed out by the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2021, “[a]n independent judiciary is essential to the rule of law in Hong Kong and the due administration of justice. It is equally crucial to public and business confidence - whether local or overseas - in our judicial system, as well as to the international reputation of Hong Kong as a society that is governed by the rule of law under the ‘one country, two systems’ arrangement.”",
            "According to the late Chief Justice of the United Kingdom, Lord Bingham, the meaning of “judicial independence” is “independent in the sense that they (adjudicators) are free to decide on the legal and factual merits of a case as they see it, free of any extraneous influence or pressure, and impartial”. Our judicial independence is premised on the solid infrastructure that has been laid down primarily in the Basic Law. Judges discharge their judicial functions in accordance with law and evidence, free from any interference. I fully agree with the statement made by Lord Sumption, a Non-Permanent Justice of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, published in The Times in March: “The permanent judiciary of Hong Kong is completely committed to judicial independence and the rule of law. Successive chief justices have made this clear in public statements. These statements are not just lip service. They represent the convictions of experienced, courageous and independent-minded judges.”",
            "At the same time, Hong Kong has a robust financial system with independent regulatory bodies such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission overseeing the normal operation of the financial market.",
            "Financial laws and initiatives in Hong Kong are conducive to business development. For instance, the subsidy schemes launched by the Government to capture various emerging opportunities, the Limited Partnership Fund Bill passed in July 2020, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Tax Concessions for Carried Interest) Bill 2021 passed this April, and the legislative proposals of introducing a fund re-domiciliation mechanism in Hong Kong, will all help attract more investment funds to set foot in Hong Kong, entrenching Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre.",
            "(2) Hong Kong has professionals equipped with international perspectives",
            "A robust system also needs to be backed by a sufficient amount of professionals and bodies. As a pluralistic and open international hub, Hong Kong has a pool of experienced professionals with international perspectives not just in legal and dispute resolution sectors but also in areas such as financial services, accounting, engineering, shipping and information technology.",
            "In respect of the legal sector, we have about 12,500 barristers and solicitors, and more than 1,525 registered foreign lawyers from different jurisdictions as well as 86 foreign law firms in Hong Kong at the moment, providing services on cross-border and international legal issues.",
            "As a seat of arbitration, Hong Kong is consistently in the top league in the world ranking. Hong Kong is ranked the third most preferred seat for arbitration worldwide by the 2021 International Arbitration Survey released by Queen Mary University of London recently in May. It is a recognition of our long-standing and unwavering commitment to the promotion of arbitral services.",
            "(3) Ample business opportunities",
            "Hong Kong offers first-rate professional financial services, providing local, the Mainland and overseas companies a sound business environment. The data below fully demonstrates Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre:",
            "(i) Hong Kong has one of the world’s most vibrant equity markets. In seven of the past 12 years, Hong Kong has been the number one initial public offering (IPO) venue globally. In 2020 alone, HK$397.5 billion were raised in the Hong Kong IPO market - the highest amount raised in a single year since 2010.",
            "(ii) Hong Kong is the world's largest offshore Renminbi (RMB) business hub, handling more than 70 per cent of global offshore RMB payments. The total deposits reached RMB788.8 billion at the end of February 2021.",
            "Meanwhile, Hong Kong enjoys distinctive advantages under the “one country, two systems”. In the Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), the Central Government explicitly supports Hong Kong to enhance its status in the “four traditional sectors” - as international financial, transportation and trade centres as well as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region. Leveraging the unique feature of the “one country, two systems and three jurisdictions” in the GBA, the Department of Justice has been actively implementing new measures, such as:",
            "(i) Co-operation mechanism for cross border insolvency and debt restructuring",
            "The record of meeting concerning mutual recognition of and assistance to insolvency proceedings between the courts of the Mainland and the HKSAR was signed with the Supreme People’s Court and on May 14, initiating the co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong on mutual recognition of and assistance to insolvency and debt restructuring proceedings. This new co-operation mechanism has achieved two major breakthroughs: Hong Kong becomes the only jurisdiction outside the Mainland where mutual recognition of and assistance to insolvency proceedings are allowed; and the mechanism expressly covers bankruptcy compromise and reorganisation in the Mainland as well as debt restructuring in Hong Kong, which is much more extensive and in-depth than the relevant provisions in the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency issued in 1997.",
            "(ii) Interim measures arrangement for arbitration",
            "With the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the HKSAR taking effect in October 2019, Hong Kong became the first jurisdiction outside the Mainland where, as a seat of arbitration, parties to arbitral proceedings are able to apply to the Mainland courts for interim measures (such as property freezing and evidence collection). As of May 21, the total value of assets preserved under the Arrangement amounted to approximately USD 1.6 billion.",
            "These arrangements are unique to arbitration and legal proceedings in Hong Kong. They facilitate the development of the business and legal sectors in the GBA and then the entire Mainland.",
            "Looking forward, the shift of the global economy is moving to Asia. The webinar series answered some “Why Hong Kong” questions, and further promoted the international community's understanding of Hong Kong unique advantages, which in turn strengthened the confidence in Hong Kong’s long-term economic development and competitiveness. I look forward to our continued co-operation with the AAIL to illustrate Hong Kong’s irreplaceable role to different sectors.",

            "由二月開始，律政司與亞洲國際法律研究院（AAIL）合辦了一系列的「Why Hong Kong」網上研討會，隨着六月二十五日最後一場「Why Invest in Hong Kong – A Look to the Future」，「Why Hong Kong」系列正式圓滿結束。",
            "研討會邀請了多位專業人士出席，他們分別來自法律及爭議解決業界、金融界及商界等，從不同層面探討香港的獨特優勢，所得的結論再次肯定香港仍然是投資，以及促成交易及爭議解決服務的不二之選，向國際社會展示香港不可替代的地位。",
            "究竟為何選擇香港？香港有何優勝之處？讓我從三方面解說。",
            "（一）穩健的法律基建與金融體系",
            "法律及商業活動密不可分。香港擁有穩固的法律基建及金融體系，提供方便營商和公平競爭的環境。香港穩固的法律基礎，包括久經考驗的普通法制，以及公開、透明和獨立的司法機關。",
            "作為中國唯一的普通法司法管轄區，香港的司法獨立和法治水平在國際間備受稱譽。《基本法》第85條保障香港特區法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。而香港的案例不時在海外被引用，這正好說明國際法律界對香港司法和法律制度的尊重和信任。正如終審法院首席法官在2021年法律年度開啟典禮指出：「獨立的司法機關對於香港的法治以及妥善執行司法工作極為重要；這對於公眾和商界（不論本地抑或海外）對我們的司法制度的信心，以及香港作為『一國兩制』下的一個法治社會所享有的國際聲譽，同樣重要。」",
            "已故前英國首席大法官兵咸勳爵（Lord Bingham）曾經指出，司法獨立的意義在於「 可以自由決定案件的法律和事實價值，不受任何外部影響或壓力，並且公正無私」。香港的司法獨立主要是建基於《基本法》訂明的穩固體制之上 ，法官按法律和證據獨立地履行司法職責，不受任何干預。我十分同意終審法院非常任法官岑耀信勳爵（Lord Sumption）今年3月在《泰晤士報》撰文指出：「香港司法機構完全致力於維持司法獨立和法治。香港歷任終審法院首席法官都曾在公開聲明中明確表示這一點。這些聲明並非口惠而實不至，而是代表了經驗豐富、有勇氣和有獨立思想的法官的信念。」。",
            "與此同時，香港擁有健全的金融體系，設有多個獨立的監管機構，包括香港金融管理局和證券及期貨事務監察委員會，確保金融市場正常運作。",
            "香港的金融相關法例和措拖，亦有助促進發展。例如涵蓋金融業內多個新興增長機會的資助計劃、去年7月通過的《有限合夥基金條例草案》、今年4月通過的《2021年稅務（修訂）（附帶權益的稅務寬減）條例草案》，以及設立外地基金遷冊來港機制的立法建議等，均有助吸引更多投資基金落戶香港，鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位。",
            "（二）香港具備國際視野的專業人才",
            "穩健體系亦需要有足夠專才和專業機構的支持。香港是個多元化和開放的國際樞紐，擁有經驗豐富以及具國際視野的專業人才，不單在法律及爭議解決服務業，還有在金融服務、會計、工程、航運及資訊科技等領域。",
            "以法律界來說，香港現時有近12,500名律師和大律師，以及有逾1,525名來自不同司法管轄區的註冊外地律師和86所註冊外地律師行，可以處理涉及跨境和國際法律問題。",
            "香港作為仲裁地的排名一直在世界名列前茅。在倫敦大學瑪麗皇后學院剛於五月公布的2021年國際仲裁調查報告中，香港再次獲評為全球最受歡迎仲裁地點的第三位，肯定了我們一直以來致力推展仲裁服務的決心。",
            "（三）商機無限",
            "香港擁有頂尖水平的金融專業服務，為本地、內地及海外企業提供良好營商環境。以下的數據可以充分反映香港國際金融中心的地位：",
            "（1）香港是全球最蓬勃、最活躍的股票市場之一。新股集資方面，香港的年度首次公開招股（IPO）集資額在過去12年有7年名列榜首。2020年的集資金額更達3,975億港元，是2010年以來最高；",
            "（2）香港為全球最大離岸人民幣業務中心，全球逾7成的離岸人民幣支付款額經香港處理。截至今年2月，人民幣存款總額高達7,888 億元。",
            "同時，香港在「一國兩制」下擁有獨特優勢。中央在「十四五」規劃及《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》明確支持香港提升四個傳統中心—國際金融中心、國際航運中心、國際商貿中心，以及亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心。為善用大灣區「一國、兩制、三法域」的優點勢，律政司一直積極落實新措施，例如：",
            "（1）內地與香港跨境破產及債務重組的合作機制",
            "我們與最高人民法院在5月14日簽訂《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院相互認可和協助破產程序的會談紀要》，開展內地與香港相互認可和協助公司清盤及債務重組的合作機制。這項合作機制有兩大突破：香港成為內地以外唯一的司法管轄區容許進行相互認可和協助破產的程序；合作機制亦超越了聯合國國際貿易法委員會在1997年頒布的《跨境破產示範法》的相關條文，明確涵蓋內地的破產和解和重整程序，以及香港的債務重組程序。",
            "（2）仲裁保全措施的安排",
            "自《內地與香港法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》在2019年10月生效，香港成為了首個內地以外的司法管轄區，作為仲裁地時當事人可以向內地法院申請保全（例如凍結資產、取證）。截至5月21日，香港作為仲裁當事人利用這措施涉及的金額達16億美元。",
            "這些措施只適用於香港的仲裁及司法程序，有效推動商界及法律服務界在大灣區以至整個內地的發展。",
            "展望未來，世界經濟重心正移向亞洲。一系列的研討會不但解答了「為何選用香港」的一些疑問，更促進國際社會對香港獨有優勢的了解，加強大家對香港的長遠經濟發展和競爭力的信心。我期待再次與AAIL合作，繼續向各界推廣和解說香港不能被替代的重要角色。",
