            "Both the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights guarantee the freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, procession and demonstration as fundamental rights. At the same time, they also recognise that these rights are not absolute and are subject to restrictions, which are necessary for respecting the rights of others and protection of public order.",
            "There have been occasions where Government premises were unlawfully occupied by protestors that disrupted Government’s operation, it was not all that long ago when this happened during the protests in June and July 2019. There have also been times when peaceful events developed rapidly into violent ones and people resorted to unlawful means in carrying out their activities. To ensure the safety and security of those visiting or working in Government premises concerned, and the normal functioning of the offices, it is necessary from time to time for the Government to implement controls on the public meetings and processions that may be allowed to be held on its premises.",
            "One example of such controls is the permission scheme that requires applications to be made for use of the East Wing Forecourt of the Central Government Office (Forecourt) for holding public order events. The legal challenge against the constitutionality of the permission scheme has come to an end with the Court of Appeal in its recent judgment upholding the constitutionality of the permission scheme and its ruling that it did not infringe the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly (Cheung Tak Wing v Director of Administration [2020] HKCA 124).",
            "In the decision, the Court of Appeal has enunciated important legal principles that sets out the proper limits of the exercise of such freedoms:",
            "(1) The Government has proprietary rights in respect of its properties: The Government as the owner of its premises has the right to manage its premises and to implement measures to ensure that premises can be used for its proper purpose and function. The Government has a duty to take precautions so as not to compromise the premises’ proper function. The court also remarked that it was a misnomer to call the Forecourt the Civic Square, and it was wrong to perpetuate the mistaken characterisation of the primary function of the Forecourt by attributing symbolic significance to it as a public place for protest or demonstration.",
            "(2) The Government owes a duty of care as to the safety and well-being of those working at Government premises: The Government has a duty to ensure that the activities on its premises would not compromise its normal and effective operations, as well as the safety of those visiting and working there.",
            "(3) The Government needs to strike a balance between the need for public order and public safety and the orderly operation of the offices, and the need to facilitate public expression of opinion: The balance should be made by reference to the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question.",
            "(4) The relevant factors when striking the balance include -",
            "(a)The nature of the public meetings and processions, and the degree disruptions to the ordinary and peaceful use of the premises.",
            "(b)The availability of alternative and equally effective means, manners and forms of exercise of freedom of expressions and demonstrations. This is relevant as there is no freedom of forum for exercising the said right.",
            "The Court of Appeal has now affirmed that while the Government has a duty to facilitate public expression of opinions at or near its premises, it must also ensure this does not compromise the normal and effective operation and public safety including the safety of the other users of the premises.",
            "The Government always respects and attaches great importance to the rights and freedoms (including the freedoms of assembly, of procession and of demonstration) protected under the Basic Law. However, it should be noted that the Court of Final Appeal in its judgment of Kwok Wing Hang & Others v Chief Executive in Council & Anor [2020] HKCFA 42 and Leung Kwok Hung v Secretary for Justice & Anor [2020] HKCFA 42 pointed out that: “None of these rights is absolute but may be subject to lawful restrictions. As will be apparent from its wording, the freedom of assembly, procession and demonstration under Article 17 of the [Bill of Rights] is not absolute but is subject to lawful restrictions including the interests of public safety, public order and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” Members of the public, in exercising their rights and freedoms, should take heed of the important legal principles.",

            "《基本法》和《香港人權法案》保障被視為基本權利的言論自由、和平集會、遊行和示威自由。但同時，在《基本法》和《香港人權法案》下，這些權利並不是絕對的，而是可以受到限制，這對於尊重他人的權利和維護公共秩序是不可或缺。",
            "過去曾經發生有示威者非法佔領政府處所的情況，阻礙政府運作。這於不久前在2019年6月和7月的示威中也出現過。初時的和平示威幾度急轉直下演變成暴力衝突，期間亦有示威者作出違法行為。政府為確保訪客或職員的安全以及辦公室的正常運作，有必要對獲批准在政府場地舉行的公眾集會和遊行活動採取管制措施。",
            "其中一項管制措施要求在政府總部東翼前地進行的公眾活動事前必須申請許可。就這項措施的合憲性而提出的法律訴訟（張德榮 訴 行政署署長 [2020] HKCA 124）已經完結，上訴法庭在判決中維持了這套許可機制的合憲性，並裁定做法沒有侵犯言論自由和集會自由的基本權利。",
            "上訴法庭在裁決中闡明了一些重要的法律原則，對行使自由的權利時釐定了適當的限制，可歸納為以下四點：",
            "（一）政府對其產業擁有專有權：政府作為產業的擁有者，有權管理場地並採取措施，確保場地的運用符合正確的目的和功能。政府有責任採取預防措施，防止有人妨礙場地的正常運作。法庭亦指出，形容政府總部東翼前地為「公民廣場」是一個不恰當的說法，亦不應因為這個錯誤的象徵意義，而誤解東翼前地的主要功能是用作舉行示威的地點。",
            "（二）政府有責任注意政府處所職員的安全和福祉：政府有責任確保場地進行的活動不會損害其正常和有效的運營，以及影響訪客和職員的安全。",
            "（三）政府需要在維護公眾秩序、公共安全、辦公室有序運作，以及在協調公眾表達意見之間取得平衡：政府需要在考慮個案的具體事實和現實情況之間取得平衡。",
            "（四）達至平衡的相關因素：",
            "(i) 公眾集會和遊行的性質，以及對場地被正常使用時所造成的破壞程度。",
            "(ii) 是否有其他選擇和同樣有效的手段，方式和形式行使言論自由和示威自由。由於示威人士沒有權任意使用土地以行使其言論自由和示威自由，這會是一個相關的因素。",
            "上訴法庭已重申，儘管政府有義務協調在其場地或附近的公眾表達意見，但政府亦必須確保這不會損害正常和有效的運作以及公共安全，包括其他使用者的安全。",
            "政府一直尊重及重視《基本法》保障的權利和自由（包括集會、遊行和示威自由），但大家亦必須注意終審法院在郭榮鏗及其他人 訴 行政長官會同行政會議及另一人[2020] HKCFA 42及梁國雄 訴 律政司司長及另一人[2020] HKCFA 42的判辭指出：「權利和自由並不是絕對的，而是受到合法限制，從其措辭可以明顯看出，《人權法案》第十七條規定的集會，遊行和示威自由不是絕對的，但可受到法律限制，為了包括公共安全，公共秩序以及對他人權利和自由保護的利益。」大家在行使這些權利和自由時，需緊記以上的重要法律原則。",
