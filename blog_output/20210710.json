            "The National Security Law (NSL) came into effect on June 30 last year. All in all, Hong Kong has reverted to a safe, rational and inclusive society. In order to enhance the understanding of the NSL among the public, the Department of Justice (DoJ) held the National Security Law Legal Forum titled “Security Brings Prosperity” on July 5.",
            "The forum comprised keynote speeches highlighting the features and effects of the NSL, as well as three panel discussions. One of the panel discussions was conducted by four scholars to compare the national security laws of various jurisdictions. The four types of offence set out under the NSL are in fact similar to those in foreign countries. Some countries vest more drastic powers in their law enforcement agencies than those in Hong Kong under the NSL. A speaker even pointed out that there is a country which could put people, who are suspected of endangering national security, in detention without charge for two years.",
            "You are all welcome to review the forum at DoJ’s website to learn more about the NSL",
            "On the night of July 1, a man attempted to murder a police officer on duty before committing suicide. Initial investigations by the police indicated that it is a “lone wolf-style act of domestic terrorism”. As the investigation is still ongoing, no one should comment on the case details. However, I would like to briefly explain some legal principles so that the public can have a proper understanding.",
            "Article 27 of the NSL specifies the offence of “advocating terrorism”. According to the opinion of a textbook on the NSL, “advocating” refers to the act of propagating, defending or glorifying the theory and practice of terrorism. On “advocating terrorism”, no one could use freedom of speech, of publication or of the press, etc, as an excuse to advocate or defend terrorist activities and such beliefs or theories, and must not promote or cheer for the “mutual destruction” slogans and propositions that would endanger the safety of public lives and properties or disrupt public order. In fact, many countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and France have already put in place relevant laws to prohibit advocating or glorifying terrorism.",
            "There is an assertion that only attacks targeting civilians are considered terrorism, whereas those targeting the authorities or law enforcement personnel do not constitute terrorism. However, one could easily tell, by making reference to the United Nations Security Council resolutions and anti-terrorism laws of different countries, that serious criminal acts, irrespective of their targets being civilians or any particular persons, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in order to compel a government, are regarded as terrorism. Such common sense is however distorted by some so-called “scholars”. It is truly disgraceful of those teachers to have misled their students and set a bad example.",
            "A number of people wrongly described criminal acts as “heroic”. Some even brought their children to express “condolences” by leaving flowers at the crime scene. There is also a student organisation expressing “gratitude” to the assailant. No sensible person would have agreed to glorify those criminal acts. Such perverse practices are immoral and confusing right from wrong.",
            "Let’s imagine, what would be the consequence if terrorist activities have been imitated by others? Legally speaking, everyone should be prudent and make his or her remarks responsibly. No one should glorify or advocate terrorist activities. Morally speaking, no one should directly or indirectly advocate or heroise terrorism as it depraves society.",
            "I hope the above could raise the vigilance towards terrorist activities and advocacies of terrorism, so that people would not blindly believe in twisted facts against their conscience. I also wish that all of us appreciate the stability and prosperity brought about by the NSL. So, let’s join hands together to achieve our common goal of “Security Brings Prosperity”.",

            "《香港國安法》由去年6月30日開始生效，整體而言，香港回復成為一個安全、理性和包容的社會。為增進各界對《香港國安法》的認識，律政司在7月5日舉辦了以「國安家好」為題的《香港國安法》法律論壇。",
            "論壇的內容除了有主題演講，指出《香港國安法》的特點和效力外，還設有三節座談會，其中一節由四位學者將《香港國安法》與其他國家的國家安全法作出比較研究。事實上，《香港國安法》所規管的四類罪行，大致上與外國法律相近。有些國家執行國安法時，賦予執法機關的權力遠比《香港國安法》嚴厲得多，有講者提到在某些國家，未被起訴已經可以將涉嫌危害國家安全的人扣押兩年。",
            "我歡迎大家前往律政司網站內的專頁觀看論壇，以多一點了解《香港國安法》。",
            "在7月1日晚上，一名男子在街上企圖謀殺正在執勤的警員，然後自殺。警方初步調查顯示，案件屬於「孤狼式的本土恐怖襲擊」，由於調查尚在進行，任何人都不應就具體案情發表意見，但我希望藉著今天的網誌簡單講解一些法律原則，讓大家可以正確理解。",
            "《香港國安法》第27條提到「宣揚恐怖主義」罪，根據《香港特別行政區維護國家安全法讀本》：「『宣揚』是指為恐怖主義理論和實踐進行宣傳、辯護或者頌揚的行為，在『宣揚恐怖主義』問題上，任何人不得以言論自由、出版自由、新聞報道自由等理由，對恐怖主義活動及其信念或理論進行鼓吹或者辯解，不得為危害公眾生命財產安全和社會公共秩序的『攬炒』口號和主張進行宣傳或者喝彩。」事實上，很多國家，例如英國、澳洲、法國等，都已經訂立相關法例禁止宣揚甚至美化恐怖主義。",
            "有人指出針對平民發動的襲擊才屬於恐怖主義，若針對的是政權或執法人員，便不屬於恐怖主義。但大家只要參考聯合國安全理事會的決議及各國的反恐法例，都會清楚看見無論是針對平民，或針對任何個人的嚴重犯罪行為，只要本質是透過製造恐慌去脅迫政府，已經可以被視為恐怖活動。這是簡單的常理，但竟然被一些所謂學者曲解，實在枉為人師，誤人子弟。",
            "社會上有人將犯罪行為錯誤地說成甚麼「英雄」事蹟，有人甚至帶同小孩獻花「悼念」、有學生組織對兇徒表達「感激」，其實稍為理性的人，都知道不應該將犯罪行為美化，這些人完全違背道德倫理、歪曲事實和顛倒是非。",
            "大家想一想，若恐怖活動遭人仿效，後果會如何？因此在法律原則上，任何人都應當謹慎作出負責任的言論，不能美化或宣揚恐怖活動。在道德上，更加不應直接或間接地鼓吹或「英雄化」恐怖主義的言行，荼毒社會大眾。",
            "我希望以上的分析可令市民對恐怖活動及宣揚恐怖主義的行徑有所警惕，不會盲目相信歪理而違背道德良知。我更期望大家可體會《香港國安法》為國家及香港所帶來的安定繁榮，社會上下應該同心協力，攜手做到「國安、家好」。",
