            "There is a need to postpone the seventh-term of the Legislative Council (LegCo) election, amidst the third wave of COVID-19, to ensure that public safety is protected as well as a fair and open election can be conducted. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) has made a Decision that the sixth-term LegCo be extended for no less than a year to address the lacuna in the LegCo operation caused by the postponement.",
            "When the epidemic is still widespread in the community, if the election is held as scheduled, group gatherings caused by electioneering activities by candidates would raise the risks of the spread of COVID-19. Yet while the regulations on the restrictions on group gatherings are still effective, the electioneering activities could not be conducted properly by candidates. Further, with four million voters all gathering to vote at polling stations on the same day, it might cause an outbreak in the community. Elderly voters might refrain from voting due to health consideration. Another phenomenon is that there is a large number of voters in the Mainland and stranded overseas who could not return to Hong Kong to cast their votes due to border control.",
            "Reasons for postponing for one year include: the pandemic is unlikely to subside soon. It is unrealistic to invoke section 44 of Legislative Council Ordinance to postpone the election for 14 days repeatedly. Secondly, postponing the election for one year, with a particular date identified, would give certainty to all parties concerned. Thirdly, voter registration exercise usually takes months to finalise. Those who are eligible but have not yet completed the registration would not be able to exercise their right to vote if the election is to be held in early 2021. Fourthly, the LegCo performs important functions and it is important to ensure its proper functioning. It considers the Chief Executive’s Policy Address from October to November and scrutinises the Budget from around February to May every year. Postponing the election for a year provides the certainty for the LegCo to continue to function according to its annual cycle. Last but not the least, existing LegCo members would not be able to conduct electioneering activities if the election is to take place in the middle of the cycle.",
            "The Chief Executive in Council decided to postpone the election so as to safeguard public interests in the light of the risk to public health and the emergency of the situation. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance allows the Chief Executive in Council to legislate speedily and effectively under such circumstances. Owing to the severe epidemic situation, the Chief Executive in Council invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to postpone the election for a year in order to protect public safety and public health as well as to ensure that a fair and open election can be conducted. The Chief Executive, as the head of the HKSAR and being accountable to the Central People’s Government under Article 43 of the Basic Law, submitted a report and suggestion to the Central Authorities on July 28. On the following day, the State Council expressed its support to the resolution by the Chief Executive in Council and agreed to make a submission to the NPCSC for a decision.",
            "China is a unitary state and the constitutional structure stipulates that power comes from the Central Authorities. Matters relating to constitutional order should be handled by the National People’s Congress (NPC) in accordance with the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The NPC and the NPCSC are powered to make legal decisions or instruments.",
            "The Decision by the NPCSC, which has been made in accordance with the PRC Constitution and the Basic Law, expeditiously resolved the problem that the HKSAR could not handle on its own from a constitutional perspective. The sixth-term LegCo would continue to function for no less than one year until the beginning of the seventh-term, thereby providing flexibilities and a solid legal basis to the Government. The Decision also stated clearly that the seventh-term LegCo would have a term of four years as set out in Article 69 of the Basic Law, which obviates the need to amend the Basic Law. One must not forget that the Basic Law is a constitutional document and it is uncommon to amend it for a single one-off instance. The Decision provides a legal basis which is binding and deals with the special situation. It is right and proper that the NPCSC resolved the constitutional matter by the Decision.",
            "The rule of law is well established in Hong Kong. When the Government realises that it does not have the power to resolve issues related to the lacuna arising from the postponement of the election, it is necessary for the highest state organ of power to handle the matter in accordance with the PRC Constitution and the Basic Law. In a judgment of a judicial review delivered in 2018 (HCAL 1160/2018), the Judge accepted the expert evidence that the NPCSC’s decision has legal effect under the PRC law and is binding on governmental authorities in the Mainland as well as the HKSAR including Hong Kong courts, adding that Hong Kong courts have no power to determine the validity of the NPCSC’s decision under Hong Kong laws.",
            "The NPCSC’s Decision followed the constitutional order and is applicable to the HKSAR. It is in line with “one country” and respects “two systems”. The power to deal with this constitutional lacuna caused by the postponement of the election is never within the autonomy nor jurisdiction of the HKSAR, whether one is talking about the Government or courts. The common law preserved in the Basic Law is not in any way affected. The suggestion that the Decision means that Hong Kong no longer exercises the common law and the Basic Law is totally baseless. The fact that such fundamental issues are mistaken means that the constitutional structure, purpose and meaning of the Constitution and the Basic Law are not fully appreciated and more have to be done to ensure that such issues are properly understood.",
            "Now that the postponement of the election and the constitutional lacuna are addressed, we must fight the COVID-19 pandemic in solidarity and focus on our economic development and improving people’s livelihoods so as to keep our society moving forward.",

            "香港正受到疫情第三波的衝擊，為保障公共安全及確保選舉的公平和公正，有必要將第七屆立法會選舉押後。全國人民代表大會常務委員會（全國人大常委會）已經作出決定，第六屆立法會繼續履行職責不少於一年，以解決因選舉押後而令立法機關出現空缺的問題。",
            "當疫情仍然在社區擴散，假若選舉如期舉行，候選人展開選舉工程所引起的群組聚集，必然會增加病毒散播的風險。若禁止群組聚集的規條仍然生效，候選人則不能進行選舉工程。當四百萬選民同一日前往票站投票，也有機會造成疫情在社區大爆發。長者亦可能基於健康考慮而放棄投票。此外，滯留在內地生活及海外的選民，亦會因邊境管制而無法回港投票。",
            "押後選舉一年的原因，包括：疫情不太可能在短期內緩和，重覆使用《立法會條例》第44條不斷將選舉押後十四天來企圖解決問題是不切實際的。第二，將選舉押後一年並定出一個具體日期，為各方提供了確定性。第三，選民登記的工作通常需要數個月才能完成，假若在明年初舉行選舉，那些有資格但尚未完成選民登記的人將無法行使其投票權。第四，立法會行使重要職權，需確保立法會能正常運作，包括在十月至十一月期間商討行政長官的施政報告，並且在二月至五月期間審批財政預算案，因此押後一年可以確保立法會繼續按照周期處理業務。最後，如果在立法會周期中進行選舉，現有的立法會議員將無法進行選舉工程。",
            "行政長官會同行政會議決定基於公共衛生和緊急的情況將選舉押後，以保障公眾利益。《緊急情況規例條例》讓行政長官會同行政會議可在這些情況下迅速和有效地立法。基於目前疫情嚴峻，為公共安全和市民健康起見，以及確保選舉能公平公正地進行，行政長官會同行政會議決定援引《緊急情況規例條例》將選舉押後一年。行政長官根據《基本法》第四十三條，作為特區首長，並對中央人民政府負責，在七月二十八日向中央提交報告並提出建議。翌日，國務院表示支持行政長官會同行政會議的做法，並同意提請全國人大常委會作出決定。",
            "中國是一個單一體制的國家，根據憲制，權力來自中央。當處理涉及國家憲制秩序的問題時，理應由全國人大按照《憲法》規定行使相關權力，而全國人大及全國人大常委會有權作出法律決定或制定法律文書。",
            "今次全國人大常委會根據《憲法》和《基本法》作出決定，從憲制層面解決香港特區無法自行處理的問題，是以特事特辦的方式迅速處理特殊情況。第六屆立法會繼續運作不少於一年直至第七屆立法會任期開始，為特區政府提供具彈性及有堅實法律基礎的決定，亦確保了第七屆立法會的任期仍然按《基本法》第六十九條指定四年，因此避免修改《基本法》。大家必須緊記《基本法》是一份憲制文件，通常不會因一次的個別情況而修改。今次的決定為這次特殊情況提供了具約束力的法律基礎，因此由全國人大常委會透過決定解決憲制問題是一個正確和適當的做法。",
            "香港是一個成熟的法治社會，當特區政府明白到沒有權力處理涉及因押後選舉而出現的立法會空缺問題，是必須由最高權力機關按中國《憲法》和《基本法》來處理。2018年一宗司法覆核案(HCAL1160/2018)中，法官接納案中的專家證據，指出根據中華人民共和國法律，全國人大常委會的決定具有法律效力，對內地及香港特區的政府機關（包括香港法院)具有約束力，並確認香港法院無權裁定全國人大常委會的決定是否無效。",
            "全國人大常委會的決定切合中國的憲制秩序，並適用於香港特區，相關決定既符合“一國”也尊重“兩制”。處理因押後選舉而引起立法機關的空缺從來不屬於特區的自治或管轄範圍，無論是政府還是法院都無權處理，因此《基本法》所保留的普通法絲毫不受影響。至於有說法指相關決定突顯香港不再行使普通法及《基本法》，這是完全沒有事實或法律基礎的。出現這些根本性的錯誤，正好說明我們必須認真和正確理解《憲法》及《基本法》所制定的憲制架構、目的和解釋。",
            "我們已經妥善地處理好立法會選舉及立法機關空缺的問題，大家現在必須同心抗疫，盡快恢復發展經濟、改善民生的工作，讓社會穩步向前。",
