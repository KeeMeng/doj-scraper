            "Welcome to my blog! You may probably be aware that IDAR Office of the Department of Justice (DoJ) has set up accounts in different social media platforms so that you can receive our news on mediation promptly and conveniently.",
            "Last Friday, DoJ organized the biennial “Mediate First” Pledge Event 2019 with the theme “Mediate First: Unlocking Potential”. It was a very fruitful and vibrant event with discussions including sports mediation and deal mediation, as well as mediation experience sharing among certain local industries. Mediation enables different parties to resolve disputes in an amicable and constructive manner. With the help of mediators, parties concerned may reach a mutually acceptable solution. In the days ahead, we will continue to actively pursue and formulate how to capitalise on Hong Kong's strengths in mediation established over the years.",
            "At the same time, we will endeavor to make the best out of the information and communications technology by establishing diversified channels to disseminate our messages to stakeholders and the public directly. By keeping you abreast of our new initiatives and key issues, I hope it will bring us closer in upholding the rule of law, sharing ideas for the promotion and development of Hong Kong’s legal and dispute resolution services.",

            "我很高興可以透過“我的網誌”這個新平台跟大家溝通，相信大家也留意到，律政司的IDAR辦公室已經在不同的社交媒體成立帳號，我希望通過各種渠道，讓你們可以更快、更方便地接收到關於調解服務的最新資訊。",
            "剛過去的周五，律政司舉辦了兩年一度的“調解為先”承諾書活動，配合以“調解為先潛能盡展”為題的論壇，探討了近年日趨普及的體育爭議調解、以調解促成交易等主題，亦安排了從事不同行業的人士現身說法分享對調解的經驗，活動非常成功。其實，調解能讓爭議各方以友好和有建設性的方式解決爭議，透過調解員可締造雙方接納的解決方案，律政司在未來的日子，會積極善用我們在調解方面積累的優勢。",
            "與此同時，律政司也會利用現今的資訊及通訊科技，透過多元化的溝通模式，將訊息直接傳遞給業界的持份者和市民大眾，務求你們可以第一時間得悉律政司的新措施及重要資訊，進一步拉近我們的距離，攜手維護法治及推廣和發展香港的法律及爭議解決服務。",
