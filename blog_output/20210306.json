            "The National People's Congress's (NPC) deliberation on a decision to improve the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to implement “patriots administering Hong Kong” aims at implementing the \"one country, two systems\" policy unswervingly to ensure the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and to safeguard the sovereignty, security and development interests of the country.",
            "Governance power should be in the hands of patriots anywhere in the world. Patriot administration is therefore a basic requirement. When formulating the concept of \"one country, two systems\", Mr Deng Xiaoping had stated that patriots must be the mainstay of the idea of “Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong”. Therefore, the criterion of \"patriots administering Hong Kong\" has already been included in the \"one country, two systems\" principle. To better implement \"patriots administering Hong Kong\", it is crucial to improve the electoral system of the HKSAR. As such, the constitutional order as set out in the Constitution and the Basic Law could be effectively safeguarded, thus ensuring the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.",
            "In the past few years, some people have been promoting through different channels the idea that there is no need to abide by the laws, or spreading the anti-China sentiments seeking to disrupt Hong Kong. In 2019, our society has been disturbed by violent acts with some people even advocating openly for “Hong Kong independence”, while some radical separatist forces entered the HKSAR's governance framework through different elections. It is revealed that the existing electoral system in the HKSAR has clear loopholes. Necessary measures must be taken to ensure \"one country, two systems\" is fully and accurately implemented on the right track.",
            "China is a unitary state. According to the constitutional structure of China, power comes from the Central Authorities. The HKSAR enjoys a high degree of autonomy. However, some matters including national security and constitutional order in relation to the HKSAR are still within the purview of the Central Authorities. As the highest organ of state power in the People’s Republic of China, the NPC has the power to introduce laws and other legal instruments including making Decisions under the Constitution. After thorough and careful study, the Central Authorities proposed an approach combining “decision plus amendment” to improve HKSAR’s electoral system.",
            "The first step is \"decision\". The NPC, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution, the Basic Law, and the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR (Hong Kong National Security Law), makes a decision on improving the electoral system of the HKSAR, and authorises its Standing Committee (NPCSC) to amend Annex I and Annex II of the Basic Law in accordance with the Decision. It provides a solid legal basis as the NPC has the power and duty to ensure the full implementation of the \"one country, two systems\".",
            "The second step is \"amendment”. The NPCSC, under its mandate, will amend Annex I and Annex II of the Basic Law in accordance with the law, setting out specific and clear provisions for the new electoral system to be implemented in the HKSAR. The HKSAR will then amend relevant local laws accordingly.",
            "The Central Authorities should take the lead to improve the electoral system of HKSAR in accordance with the Constitution, the Basic Law, the Hong Kong National Security Law and other relevant legal instruments. It followed the constitutional order of China and is applicable to the HKSAR. It is also in line with “one country” and respects “two systems”.",
            "I will lead the colleagues of the Department of Justice to assist relevant policy bureaux in completing the legislative amendments with dedicated efforts, with a view to implementing the decision to improve the HKSAR electoral system at the earliest possible.",

            "全國人民代表大會（全國人大）正在審議關於完善香港特別行政區選舉制度落實「愛國者治港」的決定，目的是全面貫徹落實「一國兩制」的方針，確保香港保持繁榮和穩定，並有利於維護國家主權安全發展利益。",
            "在任何一個地方，管治權都應該掌握在愛國者手上，由愛國者治理是一項基本準則。鄧小平先生在構想「一國兩制」時，已指出港人治港的標準必須是以愛國者為主體。因此「愛國者治港」的準則早已包含在「一國兩制」的方針內。要更好地落實「愛國者治港」的原則，完善香港特區的選舉制度就是當中的關鍵所在。這樣才能夠有效維護由《憲法》和《基本法》確立的憲制秩序，讓香港繼續保持繁榮和穩定。",
            "過去數年，有些人透過不同渠道宣揚不用守法的意識，甚至反中亂港的思維。在2019年，社會開始充斥著各種暴力破壞的行徑，有人甚至公然鼓吹「港獨」，激進分離勢力通過各類選舉進入特區治理架構。這種情況顯示香港現行的選舉制度存有漏洞，因此有必要採取措施處理相關問題，才能夠令「一國兩制」得以沿著正確的方向貫徹落實。",
            "中國是一個單一體制的國家，根據中國的憲制，權力來自中央，香港特區雖享有高度自治，但仍有一些事務屬中央事權，包括國家安全和與特區有關的憲制秩序。全國人大作為最高的國家權力機關，根據《憲法》有權制定法律及其他法律文書包括作出決定。而中央經過認真研究後，提出以「決定加修法」的方式來完善香港特區的選舉制度。",
            "第一步是關於「決定」，全國人大按《憲法》、《基本法》及《香港國安法》的相關規定，作出關於完善香港特區選舉制度的決定，授權其常務委員會根據決定修改《基本法》附件一及附件二。這提供了一個堅實的法律基礎，因為全國人大有權力和責任確保「一國兩制」得以全面實踐。",
            "第二步是關於「修法」，全國人大常委會根據授權依法修改《基本法》附件一及附件二，對香港特區實行新的選舉制度作出具體及明確的規定，之後由特區在本地法律作出相關修改。",
            "中央對這次完善香港特區選舉制度的主導權，是依據《憲法》、《基本法》、《香港國安法》和相關法律文書，做法切合了中國的憲制秩序，也適用於香港特區，既符合「一國」亦尊重「兩制」。",
            "我會率領律政司的同事致力配合相關政策局完成修改法例的工作，以期盡早落實執行關於完善香港特區選舉制度的決定。",
