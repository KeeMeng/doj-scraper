            "The year of 2021 marks the start of the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development (14th Five-Year Plan). The 14th Five-Year Plan not only provides the blueprint for the nation’s social and economic developments from 2021 to 2025, but also sets the path for Hong Kong’s development. The Department of Justice (DoJ) would fully utilise Hong Kong’s unique advantages in legal and dispute resolution service to support and complement the development of our country.",
            "As you all know, the Greater Bay Area (GBA) development is one of the major policy initiatives of the Central People’s Government. The Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao GBA, which was published in February 2019, sets the directions guiding the development. It explicitly supports Hong Kong to establish itself as the centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, recognising the distinctive advantages of Hong Kong’s legal system under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle.",
            "The development of the GBA has brought many benefits to Hong Kong and opened up vast opportunities for various sectors, including legal and dispute resolution service which is well placed to seize such opportunities. The DoJ has been liaising with the relevant Mainland authorities, striving to implement more liberalisation measures and new initiatives in the GBA to the benefit of our legal and dispute resolution service sector.",
            "We welcome two recent major breakthroughs which would facilitate the promotion of our services in the GBA:",
            "(1) GBA Legal Professional Examination",
            "One of the breakthroughs is the implementation of the GBA Legal Professional Exam, which adjusts the threshold for Hong Kong legal practitioners to practise Mainland law in the GBA.",
            "Hong Kong solicitors and barristers with accumulated practice experience of five years or above are now eligible to apply for the GBA Legal Professional Examination. Upon passing the examination and obtaining a lawyer’s practice certificate (Greater Bay Area), legal professionals may provide legal services in the nine Mainland municipalities of the GBA on specified civil and commercial matters (including litigation and non-litigation matters) to which the Mainland laws apply, enjoying the same privileges and subject to the same obligations as Mainland lawyers. Application for the first examination was opened from November 16 to 26, 2020. The first examination would be held on January 30, 2021.",
            "(2) Supplemental Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards between the Mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region",
            "The other recent major breakthrough is the signing of the Supplemental Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards between the Mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Supplemental Arrangement) on November 27, 2020. The Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards between the Mainland and the HKSAR (Arrangement), which was signed on June 21, 1999 and took effect since February 1, 2000, has been in force for more than 20 years. Co-operation between the Mainland and the HKSAR under the Arrangement has delivered fruitful results. The Arrangement provides a simple and effective mechanism on reciprocal enforcement of arbitral awards and fosters legal and judicial co-operation in civil and commercial matters.",
            "The amendments to the Arrangement, made through the Supplemental Arrangement, include the removal of current restriction of the Arrangement to allow parties to make simultaneous application to both the courts of the Mainland and the HKSAR for enforcement of an arbitral award, which was made in accordance with the spirit of the New York Convention. Other amendments are: adding an express provision to clarify that a party may apply for preservation measures before or after the court's acceptance of an application to enforce an arbitral award for greater certainty; removing the list of Mainland arbitral institutions to align with the definition of the scope of arbitral awards with the prevalent international approach of \"seat of arbitration\" under the New York Convention; and expressly including the term \"recognition\" when referring to enforcement of arbitral awards in the Arrangement for greater certainty.",
            "Coupled with the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the HKSAR which became effective in October 2019, as well as the GBA Legal Professional Examination, the Supplemental Arrangement would be conducive to the continued development of Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services in the GBA.",
            "In addition to the above measures, the DoJ has always been exploring the possibility of allowing wholly owned Hong Kong enterprises (WOKEs) set up in the Mainland to agree to choose Hong Kong laws to be the applicable law when entering into civil and commercial contracts, and choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration. In fact, we are glad to see some recent progress in this area in Qianhai (remarks). It is our hope that this initiative would be extended to cover Shenzhen and subsequently the whole GBA. \"One Country, Two Systems and Three Jurisdictions\" are the unique characteristics of the GBA. If the law of the three jurisdictions could be applied in the GBA, it would undoubtedly attract more investment from Hong Kong and overseas into the nine Mainland municipalities in the GBA, thereby opening up vast business opportunities.",
            "On the premise of “One Country, Two Systems” and the principle of reciprocity and mutual benefits, Hong Kong should continue to consolidate and enhance its role and positioning in the 14th Five-Year Plan in order to contribute to the long-term development of Hong Kong, the GBA as well as the whole country. To this end, the DoJ is fully committed to capitalising on our strengths in the area of legal and dispute resolution services so as to integrate into the development of our country, as well as contribute to the prosperity of our country.",
            "The situation of the outbreak remains severe. The measures by the Government to prevent the importation of cases and the spread of the virus in the community have gradually yielded results. However, the number of daily confirmed cases still fluctuate. I sincerely urge everyone of us should remain vigilant by staying at home to fight the pandemic, thereby allowing our city to resume its normal operation and return to a healthy environment and the path of development soon.",
            "Remarks: On August 26, 2020, some Qianhai Regulations (see《深圳經濟特區前海深港現代服務業合作區條例》, 第57條) were passed allowing WOKEs established in Qianhai to choose Hong Kong law, to be the applicable law of their contracts, even in the absence of foreign-related elements. Companies set up in Qianhai by Macao, Taiwan or foreign investors also enjoy such entitlement under the provision.",

            "二○二一年是國民經濟和社會發展第十四個五年規劃（「十四五」規劃）的開局年。「十四五」規劃不單是國家在二○二一年至二○二五年的社會經濟發展藍圖，同時亦為香港的未來發展定下路向。律政司會充分發揮香港在法律和爭議解決服務的獨特優勢，以支持和配合國家的發展。",
            "眾所周知，粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）發展是中央人民政府的主要政策措施之一。二○一九年二月正式公布的《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》為大灣區建設提供指導性方向，並明確支持香港建設成為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心，肯定了香港的法律制度在「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢。",
            "大灣區發展為香港帶來不少裨益，為不同界別創造龐大機遇，包括已準備就緒迎接這個契機的法律及爭議解決服務。律政司正與內地相關部門聯繫，致力在大灣區落實更多有關法律服務的開放措施和新措施，從而惠及我們的法律及爭議解決服務界別。",
            "最近有兩項重大突破將有助推廣我們在大灣區的服務，我們深表歡迎：",
            "（一）粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試",
            "其中一項突破是推行粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試，為香港法律界人士調整了在大灣區從事內地法律事務的門檻。",
            "具有累計五年以上執業經歷的香港律師和大律師可報名參加考試，在通過考試取得律師執業證書（粵港澳大灣區）後，可以在大灣區內地九市辦理適用內地法律的部分民商事法律事務（含訴訟業務和非訴訟業務），與內地律師享有相同的權利，履行相同的義務。首次粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試已經在二○二○年十一月十六日至二十六日期間接受報名，將於二○二一年一月三十日舉行。",
            "（二）《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的補充安排》",
            "另一項重大突破是在二○二○年十一月二十七日與內地簽署《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的補充安排》（《補充安排》）。於一九九九年六月二十一日簽訂的《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的安排》（《安排》），由二○○○年二月一日起生效，至今剛超過二十年，就仲裁裁決的相互執行提供了一個簡單而有效的機制，並促進雙方在民商事法律事務的司法合作。內地與香港特區的緊密合作，取得豐碩成果。",
            "這次透過《補充安排》就《安排》作出修訂，免除目前在《安排》下的限制，允許當事方同時向內地和香港特區的法院申請執行仲裁裁決，進一步完善現有的《安排》，符合《紐約公約》的精神。此外，更明確地以明文釐清當事方可以在法院接受執行仲裁裁決的申請之前或之後申請保全措施；取消了內地仲裁機構的名單要求，使之與《紐約公約》的「仲裁地」概念保持一致；以及更明確地訂明在《安排》有關執行仲裁裁決方面涵蓋「認可」一詞。",
            "配合二○一九年十月生效的《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》，以及粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試，《補充安排》將有助香港的法律及爭議解決服務在大灣區內持續發展。",
            "除了上述措施，律政司一直希望探討「港資港法港仲裁」的可行性，容許在大灣區的港資企業在沒有「涉外因素」的情況下，訂立民商事合同時仍可協議選用香港法律作為合同的適用法律，及約定就合同或案件的爭議在香港進行仲裁。事實上，我們很高興這方面最近在前海已取得進展（註）。我們期望可以將這項措施先擴大至深圳，之後再涵蓋整個大灣區。一國兩制三法域是大灣區獨特之處，若然三地的法律均適用於大灣區，肯定會吸引更多香港與海外的投資進入大灣區九市，創造龐大的機遇。",
            "香港在「十四五」規劃的功能及地位，應以「一國兩制」為前提、互惠共贏為原則，加以鞏固和提升，從而促進香港、大灣區以至國家的長遠發展。律政司為此積極善用香港在法律和爭議解決服務方面的實力，融入國家的發展，為國家的繁榮作出貢獻。",
            "現時疫情依然十分嚴峻，政府嚴格執行的「外防輸入、內防擴散」措施，成效雖逐步顯現，但每日確診個案的數字仍反覆不定，因此大家必須繼續時刻保持警覺，居家抗疫，才能夠有效控制疫情，讓香港早日重回發展和健康的道路。",
            "註：二○二○年八月二十六日，前海部分規例通過修訂（見《深圳經濟特區前海深港現代服務業合作區條例》第57條），允許在前海註冊的港資企業，在訂立民商事合同時，在沒有「涉外因素」的情況下，仍可協議選用香港法律作為合同適用的法律。在前海註冊的澳資、台灣及外商投資企業，在條例下亦享同樣安排。",
