            "Riding on the success of “Why Hong Kong is Irreplaceable” in February which acknowledged Hong Kong’s strength is premised on infrastructure, talents and business opportunity, the Asian Academy of International Law (AAIL) co-organised with the Department of Justice (DoJ) a series of “Why Hong Kong” webinars. I was honoured to be invited to deliver a keynote speech at the first webinar, “Why Arbitrate in Hong Kong”, on March 31. There were around 600 registrations from about 55 jurisdictions. The full event is now available for review at AAIL’s website. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you some of the insightful and valuable views of the panel speakers.",
            "The opportunities in the Greater Bay Area development, highlights the importance of intellectual property (IP) rights protection and efficient resolution of IP disputes. As pointed out by one of the speakers, IP rights are generally territorial and in some countries IP rights are not arbitrable owing to public policy considerations. In advising her client to choose Hong Kong as a seat of arbitration, the speaker pointed out that the arbitrability of IP rights in Hong Kong as set out in the Arbitration Ordinance is an attraction. Parties prefer to arbitrate rather than litigate in open courts disputes involving IP, so as to benefit from the confidentiality afforded to the technology and know-how from being exposed to the public.",
            "China, being the second largest economy in the world, provides ample business opportunities. The availability and enforceability of interim measures play an important role in the choice of seat of arbitration. Hong Kong, with its unique advantages under the “One Country, Two Systems”, reached the interim measures arrangement with the Mainland, which allows parties to arbitral proceedings that are seated in Hong Kong and administered by one of the six arbitral institutions to apply to the Mainland courts for such measures. Hong Kong is the only jurisdiction outside the Mainland where this is possible.",
            "Third party funding is often used in investment and commercial disputes. The speakers pointed out that in Hong Kong, third party funding is not only useful to fund impecunious companies to pursue their claims but also generally welcomed by other enterprises. The regulatory framework in the Code of Practice for Third Party Funding of Arbitration sets out the practices and standards with which third party funders are to comply and serves to encourage its use but also provide necessary protection to parties that receive funding. In that way, third party funding serves not just as a tool for access to justice but also for business opportunities when it is engaged to ease the cash flow problems of going concern, especially in this difficult times of the economy due to the pandemic.",
            "In the last session of the webinar in investment arbitration, the speakers pointed out that there are abundance of talents experienced in the construction field. It is particularly relevant to the Belt and Road Initiative as most of the projects are construction-related. Being a gateway for investment to and from China, Hong Kong and the Mainland signed the CEPA Investment Agreement which provides for promotion and protection of investments between the two jurisdictions. It is noteworthy that investment mediation is the only available mechanism for resolving investment disputes under the CEPA Investment Agreement. Hong Kong has been active in promoting the use of mediation to resolve investment disputes and providing training in this area with a view to building up a team of investment mediators specialised in handling international investment disputes in Asia. In April, there will be the “Why invest in Hong Kong: Current Opportunities” and investment opportunities will be discussed.",
            "One of the new initiatives in Hong Kong is to look at how to provide a level playing field compared with other popular arbitral seats which allow some form of contingency fee structures. The Law Reform Commission has undertaken a consultation to examine the recommendation by its sub-committee of permitting lawyers to use outcome related fee structures for arbitration taking place in and outside Hong Kong.",
            "Finally, I noted that the speakers shared their experience in a common theme: neutrality - the neutrality in arbitral tribunals, supervising courts and the legislative framework. If I may echo the words of one of the speakers, the Arbitration Ordinance provides an “important gate-keeping function in terms of neutrality”. It is kept up to date and amended to implement developments quickly. Last month an amendment was made to reflect and implement the Supplemental Arrangement reached between Hong Kong and Mainland in November last year and that will reinforce our strength as an arbitration friendly jurisdiction.",
            "The 14th Five-Year Plan continues to support Hong Kong to enhance its status as an international financial centre and establish itself as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region. There is also clear policy support for Hong Kong to develop into an international innovation and technology hub and a regional intellectual property trading centre, etc. In order to avail ourselves of this opportunity, Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its uniqueness of being the only common law jurisdiction in China by actively promoting the use of Hong Kong law as the governing law of contractual disputes. The importance of Hong Kong law in deal-making is widely recognised and we will further explore the advantages of it in the upcoming webinar “Why Use Hong Kong Law” to be held in May.",
            "It is promising to see that the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre and the Law Society of Hong Kong have also organised a series of webinars to promote Hong Kong. With collaboration and synergy, the bodies in Hong Kong will work together to further promote the interests of Hong Kong in the legal and dispute resolution sector.",
            "The shift of global economy is without a doubt moving to Asia. It is inevitable that more transactions generate more disputes. Ideally, disputes should be dealt with in the region where the transactions took place, for costs and efficiency but also for the understanding of the culture within the region. It is encouraging to see that other parts in Asia have been developing in the provision of arbitral service. Through fair, open and clean competition, and collaboration, all those involved in the provision of services will be able to bring about benefits for the users of arbitration. I believe that Hong Kong’s continued improvements as a hub for international legal, deal-making and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region will create positive synergies and generate more deals.",

            "今年二月舉行的「為何香港是無可替代」網上研討會非常成功，令大家了解到香港的優勢建立於基礎設施、人才與商機上。有見及此，亞洲國際法律研究院與律政司合辦一系列「為何香港」網上研討會。首場研討會「為何在香港進行仲裁」在三月三十一日舉行，我很榮幸獲邀發表主題演講。這次研討會吸引了來自55個司法管轄區約600個登記申請參加，大家可前往亞洲國際法律研究院的網頁重溫當日的內容。我亦藉此機會與大家分享一眾講者的真知灼見。",
            "大灣區發展的商機，帶出了保護知識產權以及有效地處理相關爭議的重要性。正如其中一位講者指出，知識產權一般來說屬地域性，有些國家基於公共政策考慮，知識產權爭議不可以通過仲裁解決。該講者在建議客戶選擇在香港作為仲裁地時，指出《仲裁條例》訂明知識產權爭議能藉仲裁解決，是一項吸引客戶的優勢。爭議方通常傾向選擇透過仲裁而非訴訟處理涉及知識產權的爭議，因為當中涉及的機密科技與知識技能可受到保障，不會對外公開。",
            "中國作為世界第二大經濟體，提供龐大商機，是否可以申請保全以及執行保全措施，對仲裁地的選擇起着重要作用。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有獨特優勢，已經與內地簽署仲裁程序保全安排，在選擇香港作為仲裁地時，容許由六間指定仲裁機構管理的仲裁程序的當事人向內地法院申請保全。香港是內地以外唯一的司法管轄區容許進行有關保全安排。",
            "投資及商業爭端經常採用第三者資助仲裁。講者提出第三者資助仲裁除了有助財力短絀的公司追討權利，亦普遍受到其他企業歡迎。《第三者資助仲裁實務守則》訂立了出資第三者須遵從的常規和標準，不單鼓勵更多人使用，也為受資助者提供了保障。第三者資助仲裁不僅是尋求公義的途徑，更可以用來緩解現金流的問題，尤其是在疫情下的困難時期。",
            "網上研討會的最後一節談及投資仲裁，講者指出建造界擁有具豐富經驗的人才，對大部分項目均與建造有關的「一帶一路」尤為重要。香港作為一個通往內地及內地輸出的投資門戶，在CEPA框架下簽署的《投資協議》，促進和保護了兩地之間的投資。值得注意的是，在《投資協議》下，投資調解是為解決投資爭端所設立的唯一機制。香港一直致力推廣調解解決投資爭端，亦提供相關培訓，目的是為亞洲區建立專門處理國際投資爭議的投資調解員團隊。「為何在香港投資：現今的機遇」將於今個月稍後舉行，屆時會進一步探討投資的機會。",
            "其中一項在香港推出的新措施是研究如何在公平環境下，與其他容許採用某種形式的勝訴收費架構的熱門仲裁地競爭。香港法律改革委員會進行了諮詢，商討小組委員會就准許律師在香港及其他地方進行仲裁採用與結果有關的收費架構的建議。",
            "最後，我注意到講者分享經驗時提出了同一個主旨——中立性：仲裁庭、監督法院和法律框架的中立性。我引述其中一位講者的說話，《仲裁條例》提供了「就中立而言的重要把關功能」。《仲裁條例》一直適時更新，盡快作出修訂以配合發展。我們剛在三月修訂條例，以實施去年十一月香港與內地簽署的《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的補充安排》，加強香港在仲裁方面的實力。",
            "《十四五規劃綱要》繼續支持香港提升其國際金融中心地位，並建設亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心，同時亦有明確政策支持香港建設國際創新科技中心和區域知識產權貿易中心等。為把握當中的機遇，香港作為中國唯一的普通法司法管轄區，會繼續善用此獨特優勢，積極推廣使用香港法律作為規管合同爭議的法律。香港法律在交易促成的重要性獲得一致公認，我們將會在五月舉行的「為何使用香港法律」網上研討會，進一步探討當中的優勢。",
            "香港國際仲裁中心和香港律師會舉辦了一系列的網上研討會來宣傳香港，實在令人鼓舞。通過合作和協同效應，不同的團體將繼續攜手推動香港的法律和爭議解決服務。",
            "世界經濟重心毫無疑問地正移向亞洲，交易增加無可避免會帶來更多爭端，基於成本和效率以及對該地區文化的了解，最理想的做法是在進行交易的地區內解決爭端。令人感到振奮的是亞洲其他地方亦陸續發展仲裁服務，透過公平、公開和廉潔的競爭以及合作，可以讓仲裁業界為客戶帶來利益。我相信香港繼續發展成為亞太區國際法律、促成交易及爭議解決服務樞紐，會創造更大的協同效應，有利衍生更多的交易。",
