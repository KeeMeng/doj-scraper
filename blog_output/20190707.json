            "The Prosecution Week 2019 has just concluded successfully. The theme “In Fairness We Act For Justice We Serve” underpinned that justice is dispensed with equal measures and in an even handed manner at all times. In order to give the students who joined the event a personal experience about the work of our prosecutors, my colleagues organised mock trials and also arranged court visits for them.",
            "Many of the students have watched TV dramas or movies about prosecutors with some impressions. Through a host of activities, they came to realise that our prosecutors not only carry out criminal prosecutions at courts but also provide legal advice to law enforcement agencies. However, unlike the characters in some of the TV dramas or movies, our prosecutors do not conduct investigations because this is the duty of law enforcement agencies (such as police or ICAC).",
            "The law enforcement agencies will refer the cases, after their investigations, to the Prosecutions Division when necessary. Our prosecutors make each prosecutorial decision based on evidence, the applicable laws and the Prosecution Code. Even if arrests are made on the same occasion, it does not necessarily mean that all of the arrestees have to be charged, or charged with the same offence.",
            "Irrespective of how an incident is defined by any person, one should not speculate that same charge must be laid against all those persons involved in that incident. Comments and opinions expressed in the community would not affect us in discharging our prosecutorial duties because the Article 63 of the Basic Law guarantees that the criminal prosecutions by the Department of Justice are free from any interference.",
            "Lastly, I wish to say that my colleagues and I are working together to tie in with the Government’s new style of governance by strengthening our exchanges with legal practitioners and professionals in the dispute resolution sector. Their views will be considered in the process of formulating our policies in future. You are also advised to fulfil your civil duty by refraining from any law-breaking behaviours especially violent acts or vandalism. Collaboration in maintaining law and order is the key to the upholding of our rule of law.",

            "2019年的檢控週剛完滿結束，今年的主題是“不偏不倚秉行公義”，指出律政司時刻都以同等尺度執行公義。為了令參加的學生可以親身體驗檢控官的工作，我的同事安排了他們進行模擬法庭審訊，之後更帶他們到真實的法庭聽審。",
            "很多同學都看過關於檢控官的電視劇或電影，對檢控官有一些印象。透過檢控週的活動，他們知道在法庭進行檢控只是律政司檢控官工作的其中一環，其他的工作還包括向執法機關提供法律指引。但大家要清楚明白，我們的檢控官不會像有些電視劇或電影的角色般親自查案，因為這是屬於執法機關（例如警察或廉政公署）的工作範疇。",
            "執法機關完成調查後，有需要時才會將案件轉介給刑事檢控科，而每宗案件的刑事檢控決定，檢控官均會仔細審視證據、適用法律和《檢控守則》後才作出。因此，就算在同一個場合被捕，也不等於所有人都會被檢控，又或者會被控以同一罪名。",
            "無論任何人如何定性一宗事件，大家都不應該任意推測所有涉案者均會被控相同的罪名，外界的言論或意見，都不會影響我們履行刑事檢控的職責，因為律政司的刑事檢控工作是受到《基本法》第六十三條所保障，不受任何干涉的。",
            "最後，我希望告訴大家，我和律政司的同事會致力配合政府新的施政風格，加強與法律界和爭議解決界別的人士交流，讓我們日後制定政策時能夠吸納他們的意見。但大家也必須要履行公民的責任，千萬不要做一些違法行為，尤其是暴力或破壞行為，大家應當攜手維護法紀，為香港的法治出一分力。",
