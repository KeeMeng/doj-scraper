            "Young people are the future masters of our society, their visions are important to us. The Hong Kong Law Society earlier arranged a group of young lawyers to meet with me in two evenings. In the two-hour meetings with a small group of some 10 or 20 lawyers, we had a very frank and sincere conversation on the current situation in Hong Kong and the initiatives of this year’s policy address.",
            "It is utmost important to take into account the views from the youth when we are thinking about how to ride out the storm. I explained to them the Government’s position in the meetings. Some of them shared a similar view with the Government but some took a different stance. I appreciated their thoughts which I would explore further with my colleagues. Although it is unlikely that a single meeting will give to an instant solution, I think it does provide a basis for the Government to formulate policies in future in a bid to finding a way out.",
            "I also took the opportunity to give them a brief introduction on our initiatives in this year’s policy address. The initiatives under the purview of the Department of Justice were indeed submitted to the Chief Executive for consideration after we had consulted the legal sector. This reflected that we attached great importance to the suggestions made by different sectors in the community. I wish that those from the legal sector can frankly let me know their views when we have the chance to meet in future. I will do my best to put any feasible suggestions into practice.",
            "In the policy address, we plan to provide support for our legal talents to participate in international legal bodies such as the Hague Conference on Private International Law and UNCITRAL. We came up with this idea after hearing from the legal sector that our legal professionals should be encouraged to showcase our strengths in the legal service to the rest of the world. We will support them to take up important positions in renowned legal organisations. While they can experience for themselves different legal systems, I also wish that they can become Hong Kong’s ambassadors to promote our legal systems and competitive edges.",
            "Another new initiative, “Vision 2030 for Rule of Law” is also in the pipeline. As a long term commitment, we aim to promote and reinforce the rule of law through academic and professional exchanges, research and capacity building. We have taken into account the views that more publicity has to be arranged to demonstrate the importance of the rule of law.",
            "The Pilot Professional Exchange Programme mentioned in the policy address has been formally rolled out. We invite qualified lawyers to participate in a short attachment to the DoJ to facilitate exchanges of knowledge and experience with government counsel. This would help us keep abreast of developments in the legal industry. Reference was made to a proposal from a legal body when we formulated this programme. At the meetings with the young lawyers, I also encouraged them to take part in this exchange. More details can be found on the DoJ’s website: https://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/pdf/2019/ppep_e.pdf.",
            "I am enthusiastic in continuing to meet with people from different sectors of the legal profession. While some may be skeptical about the effectiveness of having dialogues, I think it would be much more difficult in reaching a consensus in the absence of basic communication. The chaos has been going on for four months. I hope that violence could be stopped. I also look forward to engaging with the public in constructive dialogues to break the impasse.",

            "年輕人作為社會未來的主人翁，他們的意見十分值得我們參考。香港律師會早前安排了一班年輕的律師，分別在兩個晚上跟我聚會。每次見面的人數不多，約十多二十人，讓我們得以在兩個多小時內坦誠交流。我跟他們談論現時社會的局勢，也介紹了施政報告內與律政司有關的措施。",
            "對於如何處理現時社會的情況，我明白聆聽和了解年輕人的想法是非常重要的。在會面時，我向他們解釋了政府的立場，他們也向我發表了很多不同的看法，有些與政府的立場相近，但亦有與政府的立場完全不同。當中有一些看法我認為值得探討，會與我的同事繼續跟進。雖然一次會面並不能夠即時解決所有問題，但我認為這是一個好的開始，我期望這些坦誠交流可以為政府日後的工作提供基礎，為香港尋找出路。",
            "我在會面時亦向他們簡介了施政報告內關於律政司的措施。這些措施其實是律政司諮詢過業界後再向行政長官建議，最終獲納入施政報告。這正反映我們十分重視社會各界的意見，所以我期望在日後與不同的法律界別人士會面時，他們都可以坦誠講出心中所想，我會盡力將可行的建議付諸實行。",
            "在今年的施政報告，就有業界指出我們要鼓勵香港的法律人才“走出去”，展示香港在法律方面的優點，因此我們提出了與一些國際法律組織合作，包括海牙國際私法會議及聯合國國際貿易法委員會，讓香港的法律人才在這些知名的國際法律組織中擔當重要角色，令他們拓闊視野之餘，亦可以邀請他們擔當香港宣傳大使的角色，多些介紹香港的法律制度和優勢，把握機會讓其他人多些了解香港。",
            "此外，律政司明年會啟動一項名為“願景2030 — 聚焦法治”的計劃，定下一個長期承諾，透過學術和專業交流、研究、能力提升來推廣和鞏固法治活動。這項新措施亦是回應了在諮詢時有意見指特區政府要向市民致力宣揚法治的重要性。",
            "施政報告提到的專業交流試驗計劃，已經正式推出，我們希望邀請合資格的律師到律政司作短期交流，促進他們與律政司的律師互相交流知識和經驗，令我們可以更及時掌握法律業界的最新發展。這項計劃是我們參考了專業法律團體的建議而提出的。我在會面時亦呼籲有興趣參與這項計劃的執業律師，可到律政司的網站瀏覽詳細資料和下載申請表格（https://www.doj.gov.hk/chi/public/pdf/2019/ppep_c.pdf）。",
            "我在未來的日子會繼續與不同的法律界別人士會面，或許會有人質疑對話的成效，但我相信如果連基本的交流也欠缺，要尋求一個大家都能夠接受的方案就必定會難上加難。現時的風風雨雨已經持續了四個多月，我希望大家可以停止暴力，真誠溝通，共同解決現時社會上的問題。",
