            "There are extensive discussions in the last week over the political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). A number of individuals and organisations have expressed their views. Some refer to the concept of separation of powers. However, even international academic research shows that this phrase may connote different interpretations. Instead of focusing on the labelling, I wish to take this opportunity to explain, on the basis of the provisions of the Basic Law, the constitutional order of the HKSAR in substance. Our political structure is an executive-led system headed by the Chief Executive. The executive authorities, the legislature and the judiciary perform their respective functions under the executive-led system in accordance with the Basic Law and complement each other with a view to upholding national unity and territorial integrity, maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.",
            "First of all, it is important to understand that China is a unitary state. According to the constitutional structure of China, power comes from the Central Authorities. The system of people’s congress is China’s political system. The HKSAR was established by a Decision made by the National People’s Congress (NPC) in accordance with the Constitution. The Basic Law was also adopted by the NPC. The HKSAR was empowered to discharge its duties by the NPC through the Basic Law. According to Articles 43 and 60 of the Basic Law, the Chief Executive shall be the head of the HKSAR and the head of the Government of the HKSAR. As head of both the HKSAR and its government, the Chief Executive shall exercise the powers and functions conferred by the Basic Law to discharge his or her duties. Article 48 states that the Chief Executive shall lead the Government of the HKSAR, sign bills, decide on government policies and etc. This fully reflects the executive-led style of governance in our structure.",
            "Secondly, with a common goal of building a better Hong Kong, the provisions of the Basic Law set out the different powers and functions of the executive authorities, the legislature and the judiciary. In accordance with the Basic Law, the Government of the HKSAR is responsible for formulating policies and introducing bills. The Legislative Council of the HKSAR shall enact laws as required, which will be implemented or enforced by the Government. The Government is also responsible for drawing up budgets to be scrutinised by the Legislative Council. It is worth noting that members of the Legislative Council in introducing bills relating to government policies have to obtain a written consent of the Chief Executive. Clearly, under the political structure set out in the Basic Law, the executive and legislative branches are inter-related in performance of functions, but the powers of introducing bills mainly rest with the executive.",
            "The Basic Law empowers the courts of the HKSAR to exercise judicial power independently, including that of final adjudication. Some have raised concerns over the judicial independence in the light of the political structure of the HKSAR. But these concerns are totally unfounded. Article 85 guarantees that the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. Members of the judiciary shall be immune from legal action in the performance of their judicial functions. At the same time, the Basic Law also provides that judges of the courts of the HKSAR shall be appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of an independent commission. Although the executive authorities enjoy greater power in policy making under the political structure of the HKSAR, they must abide by the law. Their decisions are also subject to judicial challenges which will be handled by the court independently based on applicable laws and evidence.",
            "The Basic Law safeguards the exercise of judicial power by members of the judiciary without interference. According to the late Chief Justice of the United Kingdom, Lord Bingham, the meaning of “judicial independence” is “independent in the sense that they (adjudicators) are free to decide on the legal and factual merits of a case as they see it, free of any extraneous influence or pressure, and impartial” (remarks). The political structure laid down in the Basic Law fully reflects the principle of rule of law and the essence of judicial independence.",
            "A proper understanding of the political structure from the perspective of the constitutional order of the HKSAR clearly shows our system is based on an executive-led structure. We should all refrain from looking at the labelling of a concept, on the contrary, we have to appreciate its intrinsic meaning so as to avoid any unwarranted disputes.",

            "香港特區的政治體制在過去一星期成為社會上的話題，不少人士及團體都提出了他們的看法，亦有人談及三權分立，然而，國際上的學術研究對這個概念有不同的理解。我希望藉著這個機會從《基本法》的條文為大家解釋香港特區實際的憲制秩序，而不是著眼於一個概念的表面稱謂。香港特區的政治體制是以行政長官為首的行政主導制度，行政、立法及司法機關根據《基本法》在行政主導下各司其職、相輔相成，目的是維護國家的統一和領土完整，保持香港的繁榮和穩定。",
            "首先，大家必須明白中國是一個單一體制的國家，根據中國的憲制，權力來自中央，政治制度是人民代表大會制。全國人民代表大會（全國人大）根據《憲法》作出決定設立香港特區和通過《基本法》，並透過《基本法》賦權特區履行職責。根據《基本法》第四十三條及第六十條，行政長官既是香港特區的首長，也同時是香港特區政府的首長。行政長官作為雙首長，必須按《基本法》賦予的權力履行職責。《基本法》第四十八條清晰指出行政長官的職權是領導香港特區政府、簽署法案、決定政府政策等，正展現特區架構是以行政為主導。",
            "其次，《基本法》條文列明行政、立法及司法機關各有不同的職責，目標都是共同建設香港。根據《基本法》，特區政府負責制定政策及提出法案，有需要時交由立法會制定法律，之後再由政府執行；政府亦負責編制財政預算，由立法會審批；至於立法會議員提出涉及政府政策的法案，則必須得到行政長官的書面同意。顯而易見，在《基本法》所制定的政治體制下，行政與立法機關在履行職務上是互有關連，但提出法案的主導權在於行政機關。",
            "《基本法》賦權特區法院獨立行使司法權，包括終審權。有人擔心司法獨立在香港特區的政治體制下會否受到影響？答案是絕對不會。因為《基本法》第八十五條保障香港特區法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉，司法人員履行審判職責的行為不受法律追究。《基本法》同時列明香港特區的法官經獨立委員會推薦，由行政長官任命。行政機關在政治體制中雖然享有較大的決策制定權，但必須遵守法律，決定亦可以受到司法挑戰，由法庭獨立地按法律和證據裁定有關行為是否合法。",
            "《基本法》保障了司法人員可以不受干預地作出裁決，正如著名的已故前英國首席大法官兵咸勳爵（Lord Bingham）指出，司法獨立的意義在於「 可以自由決定案件的法律和事實價值，不受任何外部影響或壓力，並且公正無私」（註），我們的體制正展現了《基本法》所貫徹的法治原則及司法獨立的內涵。",
            "從香港特區憲制角度正確地理解政治體制，必然會明白我們的架構是以行政主導。大家不應該只著眼於一個概念的表面稱謂，而應該從實質上去作出了解，便可以避免一些不必要的爭拗。",
            "註：原文為“independent in the sense that they （adjudicators） are free to decide on the legal and factual merits of a case as they see it, free of any extraneous influence or pressure, and impartial”（見“The Rule of Law” Cambridge Law Journal, 66(1), 二零零七年三月, 第67 – 85頁）。",
