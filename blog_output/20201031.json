            "Hong Kong is one of the busiest and most efficient international container ports in the world, connecting to some 420 destinations around the globe. Last year, it handled 18.3 million containers. Through effective governance, policies and practices, Hong Kong is always committed to consolidating its role as an international maritime centre. With the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) setting up its China Liaison Office in Hong Kong last year, this establishment of the first overseas ICS office outside London reflects our efforts in promoting high-end maritime services. It also reaffirms the unique status and advantages enjoyed by Hong Kong under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle and explains the attractiveness for international bodies to set up offices here.",
            "The maritime industry covers a wide spectrum of services and plays a pivotal role in our trade and economic development. Facing an uncertain global economic outlook and fierce competition from nearby regions, Hong Kong must make the best use of its maritime “software” such as maritime legal services, ship finance and marine insurance in addition to the existing well-established port infrastructure. We also need to grasp the opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative and the Greater Bay Area development with a view to enhancing our role as a maritime hub.",
            "The Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO) has recently announced its adoption of the BIMCO Law and Arbitration Clause 2020 which includes Hong Kong as one of the four designated arbitration venues. This decision not only recognises Hong Kong’s increased popularity as a centre for dispute resolution, but also reflects Hong Kong’s position as a leader in the area of international maritime arbitration. This favourable outcome is a result of the concerted effort in promoting maritime arbitration by the Hong Kong Maritime Arbitration Group, Hong Kong Shipowners Association as well as various government departments over the years. My gratitude is also extended to the China Shipowners’ Association and COSCO shipping, representing the maritime transport sector and shipping industry of China respectively, for their unfailing support to our maritime legal and dispute resolution services.",
            "BIMCO is a renowned and leading NGO in the shipping industry and is specialised in promoting global standard forms. The new BIMCO Law and Arbitration Clause 2020 incorporates the specific provisions of each venue for users’ selection and also includes new and useful provisions relating to the serving of notices. We hope this will help attract more maritime arbitrations to be conducted in Hong Kong, with a view to enhancing and promoting Hong Kong’s status as an international legal hub for legal, deal-making and dispute resolution services.",
            "Hong Kong has always been the prime international logistics hub in Asia with our world-class infrastructure and diversified talent pool in areas such as law, financial services, accounting, insurance, transport and logistics, as well as aviation and shipping. Since the 1950s, Hong Kong has developed its international and domestic operations in logistics. Over the years, we have established a valuable global network and accumulated ample experience, thereby facilitating Hong Kong to become an unparalleled supply chain base and a hub for cargo and transport routes via land, sea and air.",
            "At the same time, Hong Kong provides a wide range of maritime services including arbitration and dispute resolution. We have lawyers and arbitrators from different professional backgrounds and jurisdictions. A number of them are professionally trained in maritime business and proficient in both English and Chinese, coupled with Western experience and knowledge of Chinese practices. They are able to offer high-end maritime law and arbitration services to shippers, shipowners and commodities owners in aspects such as ship financing, shipbroking and maritime insurance.",
            "Arbitration is a way of dispute resolution based on the agreements of the parties concerned as set out in the contract. When the parties concerned agree to submit the dispute to arbitration, the arbitration tribunal shall make the decision which is final and binding on the parties concerned. Under the current situation of global economic growth, arbitration is an important means to resolve disputes.",
            "Hong Kong has enormous potential to become an international hub for high-end maritime services. The Department of Justice will continue to create a favourable environment for the development of maritime arbitration to form a good synergy with shipping and port operations. We must also capitalise on our solid foundation and further explore international markets to complement the rapid development of China as the second largest economy in the world.",

            "香港是全球最繁忙和最高效率的國際海港之一，連接全球420多個目的地。以去年為例，香港港口處理了約1,830萬個貨櫃。香港一直透過有效管治、政策和措施，鞏固作為國際海運中心的地位。國際航運公會選擇在香港設立中國辦事處，屬於首個在倫敦以外設立的海外辦公室，是香港致力加強推廣高增值海運服務的成果之一，亦印證香港在「一國兩制」下享有的獨特地位和優勢，是吸引國際組織在香港成立辦公室的不二之選。",
            "海運業是一個多元化的行業，涵蓋的服務範圍非常廣泛，對香港的經濟發展有著舉足輕重的作用。現時面對環球經濟因素影響以及周邊地區的激烈競爭，除了固有的「硬件」基礎建設外，香港亦必須充分利用其他「軟件」的優勢，例如海事法律服務、船舶融資、海事保險等，加上把握國家「一帶一路」和粵港澳大灣區建設帶來的機遇，才能夠繼續提升香港的地位。",
            "波羅的海國際航運公會 (Baltic and International Maritime Council，簡稱「BIMCO」)最近宣布通過《BIMCO法律及仲裁條款2020》，將香港列為四個指定仲裁地之一。這個決定反映香港在爭議解決中心的地位獲得國際認同，也證明香港已成功躋身世界頂級海事仲裁中心。除了香港海事仲裁協會、香港船東會和政府不同部門的同事努力不懈推動香港的海事仲裁外，我亦非常感謝以中國船東協會為代表的中國航運業界及以中遠海運為代表的中國海運企業，一直支持香港的海事法律及爭議解決服務。",
            "BIMCO是一家知名的航運非政府組織，致力於推廣全球海運業通用的標準合同。新條款納入各個仲裁地的相關條文供用者選擇合併在BIMCO 的合約內，並包含有關送達通知的有用新規定。我們期望會有更多海事仲裁在香港進行，進一步鞏固香港作為國際法律樞紐的地位。",
            "香港配備優越的基礎建設，亦匯聚各種界別的專業人才，包括法律、金融、會計、保險、運輸物流、航空和航運服務，一直都是亞洲區內首選的物流樞紐。由五十年代起，香港已開始營運本地及國際物流，建立了首屈一指的網絡，加上所累積的豐富經驗，讓香港成為全球貨運及海陸空交通線路的交匯點，是一個重要的供應鏈基地。",
            "香港同時提供非常全面的海事服務，包括法律及爭議解決服務，我們有來自不同專業背景及司法管轄區的仲裁員及律師，當中有不少精通中英文，既了解西方文化，也熟悉內地情況，並具備專業海事知識，在不同範疇，例如船舶融資、買賣、海事保險方面，為船東、租船人及貨主等提供高端的海商事法律及仲裁服務。",
            "眾所周知，仲裁是以合同各方當事人的約定為基礎的爭議解決方式，當事人同意將爭議提交仲裁庭，由仲裁庭作終局和有約束力的裁決。在現今環球經濟發達的大環境下，仲裁是其中一個解決爭議的重要方式。",
            "香港擁有優越的潛質成為提供高端海事服務的國際樞紐，律政司會繼續營造有利海事仲裁發展的環境，與船務和港口運作發揮協同效應，鞏固我們的基礎，拓展國際市場積極配合國家作為全球第二大經濟體的高速發展。",
