            "The subject of private prosecution has attracted some media interests recently. Noting that the legal proceedings of some private prosecutions are reportedly taking place, I am mindful of refraining from giving substantive comments but outlining the basic principles concerning private prosecution.",
            "The practice of private prosecution was a common practice in days immemorial before a public body that oversaw public prosecution was set up. This right of an ordinary citizen remains notwithstanding the establishment of public prosecution bodies in modern times. In the past 10 years, the number of private prosecutions brought to the attention of the Department of Justice (DoJ) is limited. The Secretary for Justice had intervened. Yet in recent times some have availed themselves of such right and it is pertinent that the procedures and principles are properly understood to avoid abuse of process, wasting of judicial resources and most importantly jeopardizing the administration of criminal justice.",
            "There are apparently no express rules governing the court procedures applicable to private prosecutions. Some principles are laid down in the Prosecution Code as a guidance but they do not represent the full ambit of the law or the pertaining legal principles. At the moment, based on the cases, a private prosecution is instituted when a complainant submits evidence to the court for consideration on whether or not to issue a summons to the defendant. There are no set procedures on whether a hearing must be convened, whether the DoJ should be notified, allowed to participate as an observer or allowed to make representations. From the practice, it is observed that any oral hearing, if held, will be conducted ex-parte, that is, only the complainant is present.",
            "However, a complainant is generally not entitled to obtain witness statements or other investigatory materials from the police. If a complainant intends to exercise the right to institute private prosecution, the complainant would be responsible for gathering evidence.",
            "In considering whether or not to issue a summons, the magistrate has to consider whether the allegation is of an offence known to the law, and if so, whether on the face of it, the essential ingredients of the offence are present. In other words, the court has to decide if a prima facie case has been established by the evidence presented to it. By prima facie, one means generally that taking the evidence presented to the highest, whether a reasonable and properly directed jury will be able to convict.",
            "After the institution of the proceedings and whatever procedures that are adopted by the magistrate, the court will decide if a summons will be issued to the defendant to state the matter of the complaint and to summon him to appear before the court on a particular day to answer the complaint or information. There is no requirement for the magistrate to give a written reason for the decision to issue a summons.",
            "The decision of the magistrate is amenable to judicial review irrespective of the steps that would be taken by the Secretary for Justice.",
            "Section 14(1) of the Magistrates Ordinance states that: A complainant or informant who is not acting or deemed to act on behalf of the Secretary for Justice may if he so wishes and without any prior leave conduct in person or by counsel on his behalf the prosecution of the offence to which the complaint or information relates but the Secretary for Justice may at any stage of the proceedings before the magistrate intervene and assume the conduct of the proceedings and may within the time limited by section 104 for applying for a review intervene for the purpose of applying for or being made a party to any review.",
            "Section 14(2) of the Ordinance stipulates that as from the date of any such intervention the Secretary for Justice shall be deemed to be a party to the proceedings or the review in lieu of such complainant or informant.",
            "Once the magistrate has issued a summons, at any stage of the proceedings, the Secretary for Justice is entitled to intervene in the private prosecution to assume the conduct of those proceedings. The Secretary for Justice may prevent the prosecution from continuing by withdrawing the summons, declining to sign the charge sheet or indictment, or take over and continue the prosecution, or let the private prosecution continue. In short, the Secretary for Justice can intervene to withdraw the charge, to apply for a permanent stay of proceedings or to offer no evidence against the defendant.",
            "The Secretary for Justice should consider a number of factors when deciding whether or not to take over a private prosecution and what steps to follow after such intervention. A number of factors by way of example have been set out in the Prosecution Code to guide the work of the Department of Justice. Important principles have been laid down by some precedent cases.",
            "Similarly, the decision of the Secretary for Justice whether or not to take over may be judicially reviewable.",
            "The right to institute a private prosecution is an important feature of the common law system. However, it might be open to abuse. Private prosecutions which are groundless or frivolous or brought out of improper motives or political considerations should not be condoned.",
            "As the Department of Justice has the constitutional duty to control criminal prosecutions under Article 63 of the Basic Law, we have an obligation to intervene in and discontinue a private prosecution which is considered to have no reasonable prospect of conviction, be contrary to the public interest, be brought out of improper motives, or constitute an abuse of process, etc. Indeed, where proceedings would amount to an abuse of process, the Department of Justice should ask the court to order that those proceedings be stayed.",
            "The abuse of such process is also pertinent when considered in this perspective. A private prosecutor brings a case on a prima facie standard, a summons was issued by the magistrate. The trial continues and the private prosecutor is not able to discharge the burden of proof to a standard of beyond reasonable doubt and the defendant is discharged. The defendant will not be able to be prosecuted again in light of the principle against double jeopardy. Hence speed in bringing forth a private prosecution is not always advantageous and indeed may result in extremely unfair result. It is exactly for these and other reasons that the Secretary for Justice has the right to intervene to ensure that justice is administered.",
            "As a reminder, if a complainant institutes an unmeritorious private prosecution and fails, the complainant may be liable to pay costs to the defendant. If the prosecution is brought maliciously, the complainant may even face civil liability to pay compensation to the defendant. If the matter is taken to judicial review then issue of costs will arise too.",
            "We are determined to promote fair, just and consistent decision-making at all stages of the prosecution process. Any wrong decision in prosecutions will inevitably damage the confidence of the community in the criminal justice system. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for the Department of Justice to strike a balance between the right of private prosecutions and shouldering our responsibility of avoiding unnecessary and unjustifiable prosecutions.",

            "私人檢控這個話題最近引起了傳媒的興趣。我注意到有一些私人檢控的法律程序據報已經展開，我會避免詳細評論案件，但我希望向大家簡單講解有關私人檢控的基本原則。",
            "在以前未有公共架構負責檢控事宜的時代，私人檢控是很普遍的做法，雖然現今已設有檢控部門，但一般市民仍繼續有權提出刑事檢控。過去10年，律政司只是獲悉很少量私人檢控的案件，律政司司長亦曾經介入。但近期有些人運用私人檢控，因此我們有必要適當地去理解相關程序和原則，以免司法程序被濫用，而導致浪費資源和損害刑事司法制度。",
            "現時沒有明顯的規則規管適用於私人檢控的法庭程序，《檢控守則》內有一些指引，但並非代表所有法律或相關法律原則。現時的做法是，申訴人根據案件向法庭呈交證據，以供法庭考慮是否向被告人發出傳票，以展開私人檢控程序。但並沒有既定程序說明是否必須要召開聆訊、或必須通知律政司有關檢控、批准律政司作為觀察員或容許律政司陳情。現時一貫的做法是假如安排聆訊，只會由申訴人單方面出席。",
            "不過，申訴人一般而言是無權向警方索取供詞或其他調查材料。若申訴人打算行使提出私人檢控的權利，申訴人需要承擔搜集證據的責任。",
            "裁判官在考慮是否發出傳票時，必須確定相關指控是否在法律上構成罪行，而構成罪行的必要元素表面看來是否存在。換句話說，法庭要按呈堂證供決定是否有表面證據。表面證據是指假設法庭信納所有證據，有關證據足以讓合理及獲適當地引導的陪審團會裁定被告人罪成。",
            "裁判官經過相關程序處理私人檢控的申請後，會決定是否發出傳票予被告人以述明申訴，並傳召被告人在指定日子出庭應訊，就申訴或告發作出答辯。法律沒有規定裁判官須就發出傳票的決定作任何書面裁決理由。",
            "不論律政司將會採取甚麼行動，裁判官的決定是可以被司法覆核的。",
            "《裁判官條例》第14條（1）訂明：“凡並非代表或當作代表律政司司長的申訴人或告發人，可按其意願，無需事先獲得許可，親自或由其代表律師進行與申訴或告發有關罪行的檢控，但在裁判官席前審理的法律程序的任何階段中，律政司司長可介入並接手進行有關法律程序，且可在第104條所定申請覆核的時限內，為了申請覆核或成為覆核中的一方而介入。”",
            "第14條（2）指出，自律政司司長介入日期起，律政司司長須被當作代替申訴人或告發人而成為法律程序或覆核的一方。",
            "裁判官發出傳票後，律政司司長有權在任何階段介入私人檢控程序並接手進行檢控。律政司司長可以阻止私人檢控繼續進行（以撤回傳票、拒絕簽署控罪書或公訴書等方式）、或介入並繼續檢控、或讓私人檢控繼續進行。簡單來說，律政司司長有權撤回檢控，申請永久擱置程序或不提證供起訴被告人。",
            "律政司司長有責任仔細考慮一系列的因素以決定是否接管私人檢控，以及接管後的行動。《檢控守則》已列出一些律政司要考慮的因素，過去亦有案例提供了一些重要的原則。",
            "同樣地，律政司司長的決定亦有機會被提請司法覆核。",
            "提出私人檢控的權利是普通法制度下重要的一環，但這項權利有機會遭人濫用，我們不應容忍有人提出毫無事實根據甚至瑣碎無聊的私人檢控，或可能懷有不恰當動機或基於政治因素而提出私人檢控。",
            "根據《基本法》第63條，律政司有憲制責任主管刑事檢控，若我們認為私人檢控沒有合理定罪機會、違反公衆利益、基於不恰當動機而提出或構成濫用程序等，我們有責任介入並停止相關的法律程序。律政司亦有責任邀請法庭行使酌情權，擱置構成濫用程序的聆訊。",
            "在以下情況會看到程序可遭濫用的後果：私人檢控的檢控者提出達到表面證據標準的材料，法庭發出傳票和提出起訴，但如果檢控者在聆訊中未能舉證達致毫無合理疑點令被告人獲判無罪，基於“一罪不能兩審”的原則，被告人不能再就相同罪名被起訴。因此，單純為加快起訴可能會適得其反，甚至帶來不公平的結果，正是如此，律政司司長有權介入，以維護司法公義。",
            "再者，若申訴人提出沒有理據的私人檢控並被裁定敗訴，申訴人有可能需承擔被告人的訟費。若檢控是惡意地提出，申訴人更有可能需承擔民事法律責任並向被告人賠償。而案件引起的司法覆核也會帶來訟費的責任。",
            "律政司一直致力確保刑事檢控程序各階段所作的決定都是公平、公正和一致，檢控程序中任何錯誤的決定都會破壞市民對刑事司法制度的信心，因此，律政司會保障私人檢控的權利，但必須防止不必要或不合理的檢控，要在兩者之間取得平衡，這一項責任至為重要。",
