            "The Department of Justice (DoJ) is responsible for making prosecutorial decisions. At times, these decisions attract extensive discussions in the community. It becomes interesting when overseas media and politicians embark upon allegations or purported demands relating to Hong Kong’s prosecutorial decisions.",
            "Article 63 of the Basic Law provides that the DoJ of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference. This prosecutorial independence ought to be a feature in any society that cherishes the rule of law, and therefore attempts made by jurisdictions requesting such decisions to be made one way or another or even to request that they be varied is a blatant defiance of rule of law.",
            "The DoJ acts independently without political, improper or undue influence including those from public opinions and certainly not from overseas politicians who made these requests possibly not based on evidence or law but on political motives.",
            "In cases in which legal proceedings are on-going, we will not comment and neither should others as it may bring about the undesirable effect of a trial by the public. Statements made requesting the DOJ to drop all the charges or uttered with a view to affecting the DOJ’s role in controlling criminal prosecutions are futile. It is plainly wrong to label our prosecutions as “politicized”. On the contrary, no one, be they tycoons or politicians, will be above the law or be treated differently simply because they have a certain status or are pursuing certain beliefs or goals.",
            "When law enforcement agencies have completed their investigation, they would seek legal advice from the DoJ. Our prosecutors would carefully consider the investigation reports and relevant materials submitted. A prosecution would only be commenced if the prosecutor is satisfied that there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction.",
            "The well-established procedures of our criminal justice system include the independent investigations by law enforcement agencies, the independent prosecutorial decisions based on objective assessment of evidence, applicable laws and in accordance with the Prosecution Code, and finally open trials by our independent judiciary. If we are to accede or be seen to yield to unreasonable demands to drop charges irresponsibly, we would not only be unfair and unprofessional but would also act in violation of the spirit of the rule of law.",
            "I have explained the DoJ’s prosecution procedure on various occasions and stressed that our prosecutors are expected to apply the highest of professional standards in handling all criminal cases impartially and without fear or favour. They must not be influenced by political consideration. Cases should not be handled any differently irrespective of one’s own political beliefs or opinions.",
            "The HKSAR Government always respects and protects human rights and freedoms. However, these rights are not absolute. As pointed out by the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2020, “it is important to understand that the enjoyment of these rights has limits so as not to affect adversely to an unacceptable level the enjoyment by other members of their community of their rights and liberties.” There are clear limits in the law to the exercise of these rights. When law is broken, action will be taken in accordance with the criminal justice system.",
            "The rule of law is a core value in Hong Kong. We have to stand united in upholding our independent criminal justice system especially when it is under attack by any unfair and unfounded allegation made with a view to discrediting or undermining it. Any attempt to do so would only be attractive to those unfamiliar with our independent legal and judicial systems. We are obliged to continue to explain and ensure that their absence of knowledge would not override facts. We will continue to disseminate proper and accurate information and help clear any misunderstandings in the local and overseas communities.",

            "律政司負責刑事檢控的工作，所作的決定有時引起社會上廣泛討論，但有些海外媒體和政客對香港政府所作的檢控決定作出指控或據稱提出要求，卻令人感到意外。",
            "《基本法》第六十三條規定，香港特區政府律政司“主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉”。在講求法治的社會，檢控獨立是一個特點。因此，任何來自這些地方的人的要求，企圖令香港政府改變檢控決定甚至放棄檢控，都是嚴重違反法治精神。",
            "律政司的檢控人員一向獨立行事，不受政治或其他不當或不必要的壓力左右，更加不應被一些海外政客因政治目的而非基於證據和法律所發表的言論影響。",
            "對於已經展開司法程序的案件，律政司或任何人都不應加以評論，以免構成公審這個不理想的後果。發出聲明要求律政司放棄檢控、或發表言論企圖左右律政司的獨立檢控決定都必定會徒勞無功。提出所謂“政治檢控”更完全是一個錯誤的見解。相反，不論是富豪或是政治人物，都絕不能凌駕在法律之上，就算他們有特定的身份地位、追求某些信念或目的，我們都會一視同仁去處理他們涉及的案件。",
            "每當執法機構完成刑事調查，向律政司徵詢法律意見時，我們的檢控人員會仔細考慮執法機構提交的調查報告及相關資料，除非他們信納在法律上有充分證據支持提出檢控，有合理機會達致定罪，否則是不會提出檢控。",
            "由執法機構進行獨立調查，再由檢控人員客觀分析案件的詳情，按證據、適用法律和《檢控守則》獨立地作出檢控決定，最後由獨立的司法機構公開審判，這個刑事司法制度一直行之有效。假如我們隨便放棄檢控或讓外界以為我們屈服於這種無理要求不負責任地放棄檢控，這種處事方法既不公平，亦不專業，更加有違法治的精神。",
            "我過去曾經在不同場合解釋檢控工作，並強調律政司檢控人員要以最高的專業水平、公正和無畏無私的精神處理所有刑事案件。他們履行職務時絕不應該受任何涉及政治因素的影響，案件亦不會因任何人的政治理念或意見而在處理上有所不同。",
            "香港特別行政區政府一向尊重和保障人權和自由，但該等權利並非絕對。正如終審法院首席法官在二○二○年法律年度開啟典禮上指出：“為使社會上其他人的權利和自由不會受到不可接受的影響，行使這些權利需要有限制。明白這一點是重要的。”因此，法律對權利的行使有明確限制。任何人違反法律，都必須要按照刑事司法制度來處理。",
            "法治是香港的核心價值，面對任何不公和欠缺事實根據的指控，企圖損害和詆毀我們獨立的刑事司法制度，我們都應該聯手捍衛。只有不熟悉我們獨立法律和司法制度的人，才會被這些指控所吸引。我們有責任加以解釋，確保事實不會被忽略，我們會繼續發放正確訊息，釐清事實，讓本地以至國際社會正確了解香港的實際情況。",
