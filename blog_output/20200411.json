            "The onset of COVID-19 has severely affected our economy and the legal sector was not spared. I have discussed with some of the representatives from the industry and we have carefully considered their suggestions with relevant government departments.",
            "On Wednesday, the Government announced another package of measures to support individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19. Two of the measures are relevant to the legal sector: the establishment of LawTech Fund and the COVID-19 Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Scheme. Today, I would like to share with you the arrangement of the LawTech Fund.",
            "The Government always attaches great importance to LawTech. In her 2018 Policy Address, the Chief Executive supported the development of an online platform by non-government organisations to facilitate the provision of efficient and cost-effective online dispute resolution services in Hong Kong. The Government would allocate funding for the development of this project.",
            "At the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2019, I emphasized the importance of making use of technology in providing legal services, citing the United Nations General Assembly in 2016 in observing that online dispute resolution (ODR) “can assist the parties in resolving the dispute in a simple, fast, flexible, and secure manner, without the need for physical presence at a meeting or hearing\". The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation had responded to the call and embarked on a project to establish an ODR framework with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as major beneficiaries.",
            "Almost 18 per cent of the annual caseload of the courts at all levels have been affected in the first two months of the General Adjourned Period since January 29. The Judiciary has earlier started using video-conferencing facilities for remote hearings on suitable civil cases at the High Court. The media reported the first hearing conducted through video-conferencing, quoting the legal representatives of both parties being supportive of the Judiciary’s new measures in view of the low cost and smooth operation.",
            "Given the severe impact brought by COVID-19, the Judiciary has been exploring the use of various technological means in conducting different types of hearings to address the growing backlog of cases caused by the postponement of hearings. The legal sector should also take this opportunity to review the wider use of LawTech and enhance their technological capability. The Government introduced the LawTech Fund, which aims to assist some small and medium size law firms/ barristers’ chambers in procuring and upgrading information technology systems (such as video-conferencing facilities) and attending LawTech training courses. This will be conducive to the promotion of use of technologies in the provision of legal services.",
            "Under the scheme, law firms and chambers with not more than five practicing lawyers are eligible for application. Each firm/chamber will be eligible for a reimbursable amount of up to $50,000. Application for the Fund will be jointly administered by the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association. The details will be announced soon and the Fund will be opened for application next month.",
            "Other measures announced by the Government include: Enhancement of SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (http://www.hkmc.com.hk/eng/our_business/sme_financing_guarantee_scheme.html), Employment Support Scheme under which the Government will provide wage subsidy to eligible employers to retain employees (details will be available soon), as well as the creation of some time-limited jobs by the Department of Justice.",
            "Government measures alone, however, would not be adequate. We must all stand united in solidarity to fight the virus and support Hong Kong.",

            "新型冠狀病毒對香港的經濟帶來巨大衝擊，法律界亦不例外。我早前聯絡了法律界不同的代表，除了感謝他們在這個時刻聯手抗疫，同時亦聽取了業界的意見，我理解他們希望政府可以支援法律界，因此我和我的同事亦積極與相關部門研究法律界提出的各項建議。",
            "政府在周三公布了第二輪防疫抗疫基金的措施，其中兩項與法律和爭議解決業界有關，分別是成立法律科技基金和推出新型冠狀病毒網上爭議解決計劃（COVID-19 ODR Scheme）。我今日先介紹法律科技基金。",
            "政府一直很重視法律科技，行政長官早在2018年的施政報告已經提出支持由非政府機構籌建網上仲裁及調解平台，促使香港提供便捷和具成本效益的網上爭議解決服務，特區政府更會為此項目提供開發成本。",
            "而我在去年年初的法律年度開啟典禮時，亦談及了藉著科技提供法律服務是一項重要的發展。聯合國大會更早在2016年已指出，網上爭議解決“可協助當事人以簡單、快捷、靈活和安全的方式解決爭議，而無需親自出席會議或聆訊”。亞太經濟合作組織亦響應號召，開展項目設立以中小微企為主要受惠對象的網上爭議解決框架。",
            "自從司法機構今年1月29日宣布法庭一般延期安排後，各級法院因而受影響的案件數目佔全年案件量接近百分之十八。司法機構早前開始在高等法院民事司法程序事務中進行遙距聆訊，媒體最近亦報道了高院上訴庭首宗用視像系統進行的上訴，並引述雙方的律師代表對安排評價正面，認為成本不高及運作良好。",
            "疫情現時仍然嚴峻，正當司法機構在探討各種的科技手段進行不同類型的聆訊，處理因延長一般延期安排而導致不少案件積壓的情況，法律界亦須盡快檢視如何更廣泛利用法律科技，並研究如何加強相關能力。政府在新一輪的紓困措施中，推出法律科技基金，目的正是協助部分中小型律師事務所／大律師辦事處及相關人士購買或提升資訊科技系統，以及安排員工參加相關法律科技培訓。這除了配合司法機構遙距聆訊的安排外，還符合現時與客戶及他人保持社交距離的措施，亦可促進發展網絡研討會或日漸普遍的網上培訓，有助提升能力建設的水平。",
            "法律科技基金的對象是有五名或以下執業律師／大律師的中小型企業律師事務所／大律師辦事處。每家律師事務所或大律師辦事處以實報實銷方式可獲最高50,000元資助。香港律師會和香港大律師公會將共同管理基金的申請，詳情會稍後公布，目標是下月開始接受申請。",
            "其餘有助業界的措施包括：優化\"中小企融資擔保計劃\"（http://www.hkmc.com.hk/chi/our_business/sme_financing_guarantee_scheme.html）、向合資格僱主提供工資補貼以保留其僱員的“保就業”計劃（內容稍後公布）；律政司亦會配合政府政策，協助創造一些有時限性的職位，安排會稍後公布。",
            "在這個艱難時刻，我希望社會各界團結一致，繼續以同舟共濟的精神互相支持，共渡難關，讓香港重新出發。",
