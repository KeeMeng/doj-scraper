            "After the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the Government has announced a series of prevention and control measures to reduce the risk of spread of the disease in the community. Compulsory quarantine, on the basis of public health emergency (under Cap. 599 Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance), is one of the measures in place. From February 8 onwards, all people entering Hong Kong from the Mainland, including Hong Kong residents, Mainland residents as well as other visitors, are required to be subject to mandatory quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival. Even if they are entering from other places, if they have visited the Mainland over the past 14 days, mandatory quarantine is still applicable upon their arrival. Anyone who violated the regulation may face a maximum penalty of imprisonment for six months and a fine of $25,000 upon conviction. We hope that the new measures could further reduce the flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland, reducing the risks for a spread of disease in Hong Kong.",
            "The Department of Health would gather evidence and conduct investigations into any contravention of quarantine orders before referring the cases to the Department of Justice for making prosecutorial decisions. Our prosecutors would make such decisions based on available evidence, applicable laws and the Prosecution Code. A prosecution would be commenced if there is sufficient admissible evidence for a reasonable prospect of conviction.",
            "Minimising social contact in the community is another key measure to curb the spread of the virus. Hence, we only arranged a certain number of colleagues, including government counsel, paralegals and supporting staff, to return to office to handle urgent matters and provide basic public services. The reception counters of the Prosecutions Division and the Civil Division remain open over the past few weeks to allow members of the public and the legal profession to serve court documents. The shroff office is also partly open for payment service. Details of the service hours are available from our press release (https://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/pr.html).",
            "There are colleagues from different divisions returning to office to handle emergency works including attending urgent court hearings, processing court documents and attending urgent meetings. We have arranged sufficient manpower to provide cleansing service at office to safeguard the health of colleagues. For others, who are given laptops and electronic communication devices, are advised to work at home. I am heartened to learn that the Department of Justice is largely functioning well.",
            "The Judiciary announced that court hearings would be generally adjourned in view of public health considerations but the courts would continue to handle urgent and essential hearings. Colleagues from the Department of Justice have been deployed to attend such hearings to deal with cases including bail applications and sentencing.",
            "I am grateful to all my colleagues for remaining steadfast at their posts at this difficult time. I also urge those who are required to stay at home or other dwelling place for a 14-day quarantine to abide by the law and strictly comply with the quarantine orders. Violation of orders causes spread of the disease and leads to criminal prosecution. Last but not the least, I appeal to all members of the public to join hands with the Government to do their best to prevent and curb the spread of COVID-19 by maintaining good personal hygiene, thereby ending the epidemic as soon as possible.",

            "新型冠狀病毒疫情爆發後，政府公布了多項防控疫情措施，其中一項是基於公共衛生緊急事態（香港法例第599章《預防及控制疾病條例》），決定由2月8日凌晨起，所有從內地入境的人士（包括香港居民及所有旅客），必須接受強制檢疫十四日。若抵港前十四日內曾到內地，也須要強制檢疫。任何違反檢疫令的人，一經定罪，可被監禁六個月及罰款二萬五千元。政府希望這項新安排有助進一步壓縮香港和內地的跨境人流，將疫情傳入香港的風險減至最低。",
            "對於違反檢疫令的個案，衛生署會搜集證據，然後提交律政司考慮是否作出檢控，律政司的檢控人員會一如既往，按證據和適用法律以及《檢控守則》來處理，若有充分可被法庭接納的證據，令案件有合理機會達致定罪，律政司便會提出起訴。",
            "為減少社會接觸以防止病毒傳播，我們亦配合政府的特別上班安排，盡量減少需要返回辦公室人員的數目，但為了處理緊急和基本的公共服務，我們安排了部分同事，包括政府律師、法律輔助人員，和提供後勤支援的同事返回辦公室工作。律政司刑事檢控科及民事法律科的接待處櫃枱，在過去的兩個多星期如常開放，讓公眾和法律界人士可以將法庭文件送達給我們；而民事法律科繳費處亦在部分日子提供服務，以方便市民繳交款項。開放時間可參閱我們的新聞稿（https://www.doj.gov.hk/chi/public/pr.html）。",
            "除了接待處櫃枱和繳費處繼續運作外，我們亦有不同科別的同事需要在辦公室處理公務，例如出席緊急法庭聆訊、處理法律文件和出席緊急會議等。為確保返回辦公室工作的同事的健康得到保障，我們因應情況調配了足夠人手提供與防疫相關的清潔服務。至於其他同事則透過電腦和其他通訊器材，繼續在家工作，因此律政司在抗疫期間的運作大致正常。",
            "司法機構已經公布了因應公共衛生的考慮，聆訊將會延期，但法庭仍會處理緊急和必要的聆訊，因此律政司亦配合司法機構的聆訊安排，調配同事出庭工作，處理有關保釋申請和判刑等案件。",
            "我在此感謝各位同事在這個艱難的時刻，繼續為大家服務。同時，我亦呼籲所有強制在家居或其他住所接受檢疫十四天的人，必須盡公民責任，奉公守法，嚴格遵守檢疫令，否則有可能令疫情擴散之餘，亦會面臨被刑事起訴。最後，我希望廣大市民與政府一同齊心協力，先由個人衛生開始，做好防控的工作，使疫情盡快結束，大家早日回復正常生活。",
