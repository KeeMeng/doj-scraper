            "The Court of First Instance in a recent judgment sets out the principle that criminal contempt is engaged when there is serious interference with the due administration of justice, adding that offenders are punished for the sake of public interest. It is important that members of the public should, in a law-abiding city, respect and comply with court orders including injunctions.",
            "In the second half of 2019, various police quarters had been surrounded by large crowds targeting police officers and their families. Serious harassment had been escalated to violent acts against the residents, endangering their personal safety and even resulting in mental distress. Facilities of the quarters were also severely damaged.",
            "As “guardian of public interest”, the Secretary for Justice obtained an injunction in October 2019 to restrain the conduct of such activities. In granting the order, the court acknowledged that “there is a high risk that, unless restrained, the defendants will cause substantial harm and damage to the occupants of the quarters and to the quarters”.",
            "At the same time, the Airport Authority was granted an injunction order restraining persons from unlawfully and wilfully obstructing the proper use of the airport in light of the severe disruptions and chaos.",
            "Amidst the social unrest and street violence, a sizeable number of netizens weaponized personal data and engaged themselves in doxxing activities against police officers and those with political views contrary to their own. Certain police officers and their family members even received letters threatening to hurt them brutally. In order to curb such despicable acts, the Secretary for Justice and the Commissioner of Police sought and obtained an injunction in October 2019 restraining persons from unlawfully and wilfully conducting themselves in those acts. It is noteworthy that the court expressed that “the promotion and maintenance of the rule of law is not sensibly or rationally pursued by repeated and escalating breaches of the law”, and “[p]ersons who commit such crimes are simply, and properly described as, ‘criminals’. Criminal activity does not cease to be criminal activity simply because the actor believes himself or herself to be acting for a particular, perhaps higher, cause”.",
            "Doxxing activities towards counsel, judges, legislators and other persons involved in the administration of justice were found to be on the rise in 2020, especially when cases relating to the 2019 incidents were heard. Such unlawful acts must be curtailed. As pointed out by the court in its decision in a case of contempt of court, doxxing itself is capable of constituting criminal activity. In the injunction issued in October last year restraining the conduct of such activities towards Judges, Judicial Officers and their family members, the court held that “[i]t remains fundamental to the rule of law that litigants and the general public are able to place reliance on and have confidence in a Court system that is free from bias, and that the Judge or Judicial Officer in any case is the person who decides that case according to its evidence and the applicable law.”",
            "Notwithstanding the injunctions, some people still blatantly violated these orders. Such conduct gave rise to serious challenge to the administration of justice and the rule of law. As a result, the Department of Justice has lodged committal applications for contempt of court. Contemnors, who admitted liability for contempt of court, were sentenced, including immediate imprisonment, and below are some significant messages set out in the judgments:",
            "(1)It is fundamental to the rule of law that court orders are made to be obeyed. Contempt of court orders is a serious matter. Thus, the starting penalty for both civil and criminal contempt of court in breaching an injunction order is imprisonment, perhaps measured in months.",
            "(2)Criminal contempt threatens the due administration of justice as a whole and presents a direct challenge to the rule of law. The immense public interest involved in protecting the due administration of justice as an integral component of the rule of law ordinarily calls for a deterrent sentence on the contemnor.",
            "(3)Punishment and deterrence are the major sentencing considerations for cases of criminal contempt. The sentence to be imposed should contain an element of general and personal deterrence.",
            "(4)Rights and freedoms do not exist in a vacuum and they come with responsibilities. Any person exercising their own rights and freedom must simultaneously have respect for the rights and freedom of others. Freedom of speech certainly does not embrace any right to harass or intimidate, threaten or menace. Irrespective of a person’s political stance, there are proper channels to express one’s views in a legitimate and proper manner.",
            "Whilst these injunctions relate to specific categories of persons, a common thread from these judgments is that doxxing activities are not to be condoned. The Government will legislate to prevent doxxing so that the general public will also be protected in their own rights. Not only would these doxxing activities violate privacy rights, when conducted with a view to deter or levy a direct or indirect threat against a person from discharging his/ her duties or exercising his/ her rights, these must be stopped. It falls upon each of us to join hands and condemn these actions so that the law and order that has been restored after the passing of the National Security Law is maintained, so that people are free to exercise their rights whilst respecting that of others. All of us should jointly bear the responsibility to respect, promote and further the rule of law as a fundamental basis of our society.",

            "高等法院原訟法庭在最近頒下的一份判決書內清楚訂明，嚴重干擾司法工作妥善執行，是構成刑事藐視法庭的準則，並指出懲罰違法者是為了保障公眾利益。在一個守法的地方，市民必須尊重和遵守法庭的命令，包括禁制令。",
            "在二○一九年的下半年，多個警察宿舍被示威者大規模圍堵，針對警務人員及其家人，嚴重的滋擾演變成威脅居民人身安全的暴力行為，甚至對他們構成精神困擾，宿舍的設施亦遭大肆破壞。",
            "律政司司長作為公眾利益守護者，在二○一九年十月成功向法庭申請禁制令，禁止進行這種不法行為。法庭批出禁制令時指出「除非被告被禁制，否則他們對宿舍居民及宿舍作出實質損害及破壞的風險極高。」",
            "與此同時，機場出現擾攘和混亂的情況，香港機場管理局亦獲法庭批出禁制令，禁止任何人非法及有意圖故意阻礙或干擾香港國際機場的正常使用。",
            "在社會動盪和暴力蔓延期間，有相當數量的網民將個人資料武器化，對警察以及持相反政見的人起底。有警務人員及其家人甚至收到恐嚇信件，表示會以殘暴方法傷害他們。為遏止歪風，律政司司長及警務處處長在二○一九年十月取得禁制令，禁止任何人非法及有意圖故意作出此類行為。法庭指出「重覆和不斷升級的違法行為在情理上是沒有可能促進和維持法治」，而「干犯這類罪行的人，稱之為『罪犯』也不為過。犯罪活動不會純粹因為犯事者自以為基於某個特定或可能更崇高的原因行事，便變成不是犯罪活動」。",
            "由於去年針對律師、法官、立法會議員及其他執行司法工作人員的起底行為有上升的趨勢，尤其當他們處理涉及二○一九年的案件時，情況必須加以制止。法庭曾經在一宗藐視法庭案件的裁決中指出，「起底」本身可構成犯罪活動。而法庭去年十月頒布針對法官、司法人員及其家屬被起底及滋擾的禁制令時，明確指出「法治的關鍵在於訴訟人和公眾能夠依賴和信任不偏不倚的法院制度，以及審理任何案件的法官或司法人員均會根據案中證據和適用法律判案。」",
            "縱使禁制令已經生效，仍然有人公然違反命令。這些行為對司法工作和法治構成嚴重挑戰。有見及此，律政司向法庭入稟申請就這些藐視法庭個案提控。違法者均認罪並被判罰，包括即時監禁。以下歸納了判決的一些重點：",
            "（一）遵從法院命令對法治至為重要。藐視法庭命令的後果非常嚴重。故此，違反禁制令而干犯民事或刑事藐視法庭，均以監禁為判刑起點，刑期或數以月計。",
            "（二）刑事藐視法庭對妥善執行司法工作整體構成威脅，並且直接挑戰法治。保障司法工作妥為執行是法治的要素，涉及重大公眾利益，一般要對藐視法庭者判處具阻嚇性的刑罰。",
            "（三）懲罰和阻嚇是刑事藐視案件的主要量刑因素。法庭所判處的刑罰應具有普遍及個人阻嚇作用。",
            "（四）權利和自由不能脫離實際，定必有責任伴隨。任何人在行使自身權利和自由的同時，也須尊重他人的權利和自由。言論自由一定不包括任何侵擾或恐嚇、威脅或恫嚇的權利。不論政治立場，任何人都應該透過合法和正當的渠道表達意見。",
            "雖然禁制令所禁制的對象是指定類別的人，但法庭的判辭都有一個共通點，就是指出絕不容忍起底行為。政府會制定相關法例，以防止起底，令普通市民的權利也同樣獲得保障。起底行為不僅侵犯隱私，若為了妨礙或直接或間接威脅他人履行職務或行使權利，更必須被制止。每個人都應聯手譴責起底這種不法行為，以維護在《香港國安法》通過後所恢復的治安和秩序。大家自由行使權利之餘，亦要尊重他人的權利，社會上所有人都有責任積極捍衛法治。",
